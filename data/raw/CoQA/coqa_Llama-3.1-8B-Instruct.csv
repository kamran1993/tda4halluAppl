One day, a bottle floated by over the heads of Asta and his friends. They looked up and saw the bottle. ""What is it?"" said Asta's friend Sharkie. ""It looks like a bird's belly,"" said Asta. But when they swam closer, it was not a bird's belly. It was hard and clear, and there was something inside it. 

The bottle floated above them. They wanted to open it. They wanted to see what was inside. So they caught the bottle and carried it down to the bottom of the ocean. They cracked it open on a rock. When they got it open, they found what was inside. It was a note. The note was written in orange crayon on white paper. Asta could not read the note. Sharkie could not read the note. They took the note to Asta's papa. ""What does it say?"" they asked. 

Asta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, ""This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her."" And that is what they did. Q: what was the name of the fish A: Asta. Q: What looked like a birds belly A: a bottle.

1,"Kendra and Quinton travel to and from school every day. Kendra lives further from the bus stop than Quinton does, stops every morning at Quinton's house to join him to walk to the bus stop. Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that Quinton's mother has ready and waiting for them. Quinton can't eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day. They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together. Kendra always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner. She doesn't want to miss story time which was right before bedtime. 

One morning Kendra walked up to Quinton's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally Quinton was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found. Kendra went up to the door and knocked. She waited and waited and yet no one answered. She saw that Quinton's mother's car wasn't in their driveway which was weird. She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when Quinton was nowhere to be found. 

Kendra didn't want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time. The bus driver saw that she was upset and that Quinton was not with her that morning. She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay. 

Kendra got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning. The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, Quinton's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.

4,"Which country grows the most tea? The answer is India. It grows three times as much as China. Which country drinks the most tea? It's neither China nor Japan. It's Great Britain. In the wild, tea plants may be 30 feet tall. But a plant grown for market is pruned. Pruning keeps the plant only three or four feet tall. This is an easy height for tea picking. Only the two top leaves and bud of each new shoot are picked. So to make money, tea plantations must be huge. In general, there are two kinds of tea. Black tea and green tea. Black tea is fermented. In the process, the tea loses nearly all of its healthy qualities. Green tea is steamed right after the leaves are picked. Green tea _ its healthy qualities. For example, it may prevent heart disease. How did we get tea bag? The answer: by accident. Tea merchants used to send samples in tin boxes. This was costly. One merchant thought of a cheaper way. He sent samples in small silk bags. Customers would cut open the bag. They would brew the leaves as usual. One customer put the bag into a pot. Then he just poured hot water over it. And the tea bag was born. Shen Nong was the first to drink tea. (Shen was a Chinese emperor.) This was about 2737 B.C. Shen had bad digestion. So he drank several cups of hot water daily. One day something happened. Leaves from a wild tea tree fell into the hot water pot. The next cup was poured. The water was now colored. Shen sipped it. He liked it. He drank it all. Shen was proud of his new drink. He served it to his guests. Word spread. People thought this way. Tea is good enough for the Emperor. So it must be good enough for the people. Tea became the drink of China. Q: Which country consumes tea the most? A: Great Britain. Q: Which country grows it the most? A: India. Q: How tall is the tea plant? A: may be 30 feet tall.

Northward, along the leeward coast of Malaita, the _Ariel_ worked her leisurely way, threading the colour-riotous lagoon that lay between the shore-reefs and outer-reefs, daring passages so narrow and coral-patched that Captain Winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his head, and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal life. For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry. So long as the way was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere. 

During this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an entire series of names for himself. This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing. 

""A name he must have had,"" he argued to Villa. ""Haggin must have named him before he sailed on the _Arangi_. Therefore, nameless he must be until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name."" 

""What's in a name?"" Villa had begun to tease. 

""Everything,"" her husband retorted. ""Think of yourself, shipwrecked, called by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or just plain 'Topsy.' And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or ' Judas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.' No, keep him nameless, until we find out his original name."" 

""Must call him something,"" she objected. ""Can't think of him without thinking something."" 

""Then call him many names, but never the same name twice. Call him 'Dog' to-day, and 'Mister Dog' to-morrow, and the next day something else.""  Q: What worked her way northward? A: The _Ariel_. Q: What lay between the shore-reefs and outer-reefs? A: Lagoon. Q: Were the passages wide? A: No. Q: Who was the Captain? A: Winters. Q: Did he have red hair? A: No. Q: Were Harley and Villa in a hurry? A: No. Q: What coast did the Ariel work her way up leisurely? A: Malaita. Q: Who argued to Villa that he must have a name? A: Harley Kennan.

WAITING. 

The lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola most desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. 

Both these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. 

Far on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo. Romola went to witness the scene, that the resistance it inspired might invigorate that sympathy with Savonarola which was one source of her strength. It was in memorable contrast with the scene she had been accustomed to witness there.  Q: Who was excommunicated? A: Fra Girolamo. Q: Was he a heretic? A: no. Q: Was he superstitious? A: no. Q: Why was he excommunicated then? A: unknown. Q: Who was inspired by this man? A: Romola. Q: Where was the Excommunication published? A: in the Duomo. Q: When? A: June. Q: How long was it published? A: for some weeks. Q: What was Romola looking for? A: a sign from Baldassarre. Q: What else was she looking for? A: sympathy with Savonarola. Q: What did the summer days bring?

""Baby born to woe."" 

F. T. PALGRAVE. 

When Anne Woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at Portchester, and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream, in which she only mechanically took her part, one thing impressed itself on her gradually, and that was disappointment. If the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations, perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly; but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated. Her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself. Jane Humphreys was a harmless but silly girl, not much wiser, though less spoilt, than poor little Madam, and full of Cockney vulgarities. Education was unfashionable just then, and though Hester Bridgeman was bettor born and bred, being the daughter of an attorney in the city, she was not much better instructed, and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage. Pauline Dunord was by far the best of the three, but she seemed to live a life apart, taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her Church. The nursery was quite a separate establishment; there was no mingling with the guests of royalty, who were only seen in excited peeps from the window, or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the Prince. As to books, the only secular one that Anne saw while at Whitehall was an odd volume of Parthenissa. The late King's summary of the Roman controversy was to be had in plenty, and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced.  Q: who was Anne's companion A: rockers. Q: what was the only secular book she saw while at whitehall? A: an odd volume of Parthenissa. Q: what feeling impressed upon Anne?

39,"(CNN)Formula One star Fernando Alonso returned to work at McLaren on Wednesday following his freak accident in winter testing. 

The Spanish double world champion was ruled out of the opening race in Australia by doctors treating him for the effects of a high speed crash. 

Alonso has been training hard for his planned comeback at the Malaysian Grand Prix in nine days' time and used the McLaren simulator to hone his mental preparations. 

The CNN-sponsored team announced the news on Twitter, showing McLaren sporting director Eric Boullier and Alonso at the team's headquarters in Woking, England. 

Alonso was concussed and airlifted to hospital after losing control of his McLaren at the penultimate winter test at Barcelona's Circuit de Catalunya on February 22. 

The 33-year-old watched the Melbourne race from his home in Dubai after doctors indicated returning to racing three weeks after a high impact was too risky. 

McLaren had explained that Alonso's ""accident was caused by the unpredictably gusty winds at that part of the circuit at that time."" 

After getting back to race preparation in the simulator, McLaren tweeted that it had been a good day for Alonso, ""focusing on operational work and practicing qualifying and race procedures."" 

The media enjoyed a guessing game in Australia about just how Alonso might have reacted to events in Melbourne, where Lewis Hamilton and his mighty Mercedes dominated while Alonso's McLaren teammate Jenson Button finished in last place. 

Dane Kevin Magnussen, who was deputizing for the recuperating Spaniard, was unable to start the race because of engine problems on his way to the starting grid.

MESSRS. TREAT, JONES, WESTON & DOWD. 

The particular circle of society in which Ben and Johnny moved was shaken to its very centre by the news which was whispered from one to the other on the day after those young gentlemen and Paul had taken up their abode at Mrs. Green's. 

Early that morning the most exciting topic of conversation had been Master Spry's misfortune and Tim Dooley's perfidy; and that had hardly begun to be commented upon when the news spread that Ben and Johnny, since the coming of their guest, who was evidently a suspicious sort of a person, as was shown by his clothes and his entire ignorance of the slang of the street, were no longer proud of their neat little bit of real estate, but had made a change which would probably be the means of their financial ruin. That they had been so extravagant as to engage rooms at a regular boarding-house, where they were to spend their substance on three square meals each day, seemed like a reckless disregard of money; and the price which they were to pay for board was stated at various sums from five to ten dollars per week. But that was not the only bit of wonderful news. 

Jimmy Sullivan stated--and he was supported by several others as the time wore on--that Johnny himself had told him that they were to start a regular theatre, and had already engaged a hall, which would be converted into a first-class place of amusement as soon as possible. This would have been regarded simply as a rumor started for the purpose of injuring the credit of these young gentlemen, had it not come so directly from one of the parties concerned, and must therefore be true.

DEFEAT. 

A grey dimness was creeping in upon the schooner when a little bitter breeze sprang up from westwards, and Dampier bade them get the mainsail on to her. 

""I don't like the look of the weather, and I'm beginning to feel that I'd like to see that boat,"" he said. ""Anyhow, we'll get way on her."" 

It was a relief to hoist the mainsail. The work put a little warmth into them, and the white men, at least, had been conscious of a growing uneasiness about their comrades in the boat. The breeze had, however, freshened before they set it, and there were white caps on the water when the _Selache_ headed for the ice. It had somewhat changed its formation when they approached it, for big masses had become detached from it and were moving out into the open water, while the opening had become perceptibly narrower. The light was now fading rapidly, and Wyllard took the wheel when Dampier sent the man there forward. 

""Get the cover off the second boat, and see everything clear for hoisting out,"" he said to him, and then called to Wyllard. ""We're close enough. You'd better heave her round."" 

She came round with a thrashing of canvas, stretched out seawards, and came back again with her deck sharply slanted and little puffs of bitter spray blowing over her weather rail, for there was no doubt that the breeze was freshening fast. Then Dampier sent a man up into the foremast shrouds, and looked at Wyllard afterwards.

54,"A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. 

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. 

Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk. 

The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. 

Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants.""

At once a crowd of performers surrounded the pair. Very few of them liked Jack Snipper, and they wondered what Leo would do should the gymnast attack the boy. 

“Call me a braggart, will you!” roared Snipper. 

“Don’t you dare to touch me with that club!” replied Leo calmly. 

“I’ll teach you a lesson!” 

And, swinging the Indian club over his head, Jack Snipper made a savage blow at the young gymnast. 

Had the stick struck Leo the boy’s head would have sustained a severe injury. 

But as quick as a flash Leo dodged, and the Indian club merely circled through the empty air. 

“For shame, Snipper!” 

“Do you want to kill the boy?” 

“What harm has he done?” 

And so the cries ran on. 

“Mind your own affairs!” shouted the maddened gymnast. “I’m going to teach the boy a lesson!” 

Again he sprang at Leo. 

But now suddenly the Indian club was caught. A dexterous twist, and it went flying out of reach across the dressing tent. 

Then, before Snipper could recover, he received a stinging slap full in the face that sent him staggering backward on the grass. 

A shout of approval went up. 

“Good for Leo!” 

“That’s right, boy, stand up for your rights!”

Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in ""The Proposal."" 

Something old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? 

Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. 

And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is ""X-Men's"" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) 

Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) 

OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. 

Something new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.

Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. 

And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is ""X-Men's"" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) 

Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) 

OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. 

Something new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.

69,"Fort Lauderdale, Florida (CNN) -- Just taking a sip of water or walking to the bathroom is excruciatingly painful for 15-year-old Michael Brewer, who was burned over 65 percent of his body after being set on fire, allegedly by a group of teenagers. 

""It hurts my heart to see him in pain, but it enlightens at the same time to know my son is strong enough to make it through on a daily basis,"" his mother, Valerie Brewer, told CNN on Wednesday.

Jarvis' older brother has been charged in the October 12 attack in Deerfield Beach, Florida. 

When asked about the teen's statement, Valerie Brewer -- who knows the Jarvis family -- said she ""can't focus on that."" 

""I would really like to stay away from that because that brings negative energy to me and I don't need that right now,"" she said. 

Her son remains in guarded condition at the University of Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital Burn Center. He suffered second- and third-degree burns over about two-thirds of his body, according to the hospital's associate director, Dr. Carl Schulman. 

The teen faces a lifelong recovery from his injuries, Schulman told CNN's Harris.  Q: What is the subject of the story? A: Michael Brewer. Q: What happened to him? A: He was burned. Q: How badly?

71,"Anthropology is the study of humans and their societies in the past and present. Its main subdivisions are social anthropology and cultural anthropology, which describes the workings of societies around the world, linguistic anthropology, which investigates the influence of language in social life, and biological or physical anthropology, which concerns long-term development of the human organism. Archaeology, which studies past human cultures through investigation of physical evidence, is thought of as a branch of anthropology in the United States, while in Europe, it is viewed as a discipline in its own right, or grouped under other related disciplines such as history. 

Similar organizations in other countries followed: The American Anthropological Association in 1902, the Anthropological Society of Madrid (1865), the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The majority of these were evolutionist. One notable exception was the Berlin Society of Anthropology (1869) founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's conclusions lacked empirical foundation. Q: Who disagreed with Darwin? A: Rudolph Virchow. Q: What did he found?

73,"When my father was dying, I traveled a thousand miles from home to be with him in his last days. It was far more heartbreaking than I'd expected, one of the most difficult and painful times in my life. After he passed away I stayed alone in his apartment. There were so many things to deal with. It all seemed endless. I was lonely. I hated the silence of the apartment. 

But one evening the silence was broken: I heard crying outside. I opened the door to find a little cat on the steps. He was thin and poor. He looked the way I felt. I brought him inside and gave him a can of fish. He ate it and then almost immediately fell sound asleep. 

The next morning I checked with neighbors and learned that the cat had been abandoned by his owner who's moved out. So the little cat was there all alone, just like I was. As I walked back to the apartment, I tried to figure out what to do with him. Having something else to take care of seemed _ But as soon as I opened the apartment door he came running and jumped into my arms. It was clear from that moment that he had no intention of going anywhere. I started calling him Willis, in honor of my father's best friend. 

From then on, things grew easier. With Willis in my lap time seemed to pass much more quickly. When the time finally came for me to return home I had to decide what to do about Willis. There was absolutely no way I would leave without him.

Grandpa Peter heard all about it and said, ""This sounds like a job for Tubby."" So Andy's parents loaded the cat onto the car and returned home.

81,"Time was running out, and Mark Dickinson wasn't sure whether he'd get to see his dying 2-year-old grandson one last time. A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. 

His grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. 

""I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,"" Dickinson told KABC. 

That's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. 

""I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,'""Dickinson told KABC. 

Authorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel. 

Thanks to the pilot, Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the sympathetic pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were praiseworthy. 

""You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision,"" Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said.

82,"Richmond, Virginia (CNN) -- The Virginia governor's race, billed as the marquee battle of an otherwise anticlimactic 2013 election cycle, is shaping up to be a foregone conclusion. 

Democrat Terry McAuliffe, the longtime political fixer and moneyman, hasn't trailed in a poll since May. Barring a political miracle, Republican Ken Cuccinelli will be delivering a concession speech on Tuesday evening in Richmond. 

In recent cycles, the Virginia race has been a key off-year barometer of national political sentiment. Four years ago, Republican Bob McDonnell won in blowout fashion, a victory that presaged the following year's GOP midterm wave. In 2005, Democrat Tim Kaine captured the governor's mansion, tapping into anxiety about President George W. Bush's handling of the Iraq War and Hurricane Katrina. 

Not so this year. The McAuliffe-Cuccinelli race has been defined by small-bore issues and character attacks rather than sweeping national concerns. 

But despite the lack of late fireworks, there are plenty of crucial insights to be gleaned from the Virginia campaign. 

Here's what you need to know about this year's most important race: 

1. The 2012 playbook is still potent for Democrats 

McAuliffe isn't exactly squeaky-clean. A longtime wheeler-dealer who has been less than forthcoming with his tax returns, ""the Macker"" has a history of eyebrow-raising business ventures that make for dangerous campaign fodder. The opposition research book on the former Democratic National Committee chairman is as thick a Virginia live oak. 

But Democrats have successfully turned the race into a referendum on Cuccinelli, defining him over the summer as a right-wing zealot. A Washington Post poll last week showed that two-thirds of McAuliffe supporters said they were voting against Cuccinelli, rather than for McAuliffe.  Q: What are the candidates running for?

""He looked at me, and he took a breath to get the words out, and he opened his mouth,"" says Chris Carroll, a retired sergeant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, in a new feature with Vegas Seven. ""And then the words came out: 'F**k you.'""

Shakur was shot multiple times on September 7th, 1996.

Carroll, who worked with the city's bike patrol unit, had also been watching the same Mike Tyson fight, but was unaware of the brawl taking place in the lobby. 

Later, a white Cadillac pulled up beside Knight and Shakur while they were stopped at a traffic light and one man began shooting out of the back window. Carroll was the first officer to respond to the grisly scene.

89,"(Financial Times) -- While most consumer goods companies are seeking opportunities in China, domestic condom maker Safedom is going in the opposite direction -- seeking European partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global. 

The company, majority-owned by its founder, has grown rapidly in its short life. It will sell 200m condoms this year, all within China, and is targeting sales of 1bn next year; the same number that Durex, the world's biggest player, was producing in the country within three years. 

Brian Fu, chief executive, was in the UK last week ""meeting potential partners and acquisitions"". Funding for any deal will either come from existing shareholders, bank loans or possibly through an overseas stock market listing, he said. 

Despite the size of the market on its own doorstep -- and added attraction of a government-mandated one-child policy -- Safedom sees its future on the international stage. It reckons its virus-proof latex condoms will enable it to compete alongside the global players such as Durex, now part of Reckitt Benckiser, and Ansell of Australia. 

However, Mr Fu said that the strength of his company -- whose range includes Beautiful Girl, Take Me and Green Lemon -- was in manufacturing and technology, and going global required bringing in branding and marketing expertise. 

Sales outlets and channels are also likely to vary from China, where half of all condoms are bought by women. 

""We think we have good leading edge technology and a good management team. What we lack is the branding part: we are not well known,"" Mr Fu said.  Q: What company makes condoms? A: Safedom. Q: What is it seeking? A: European partners or acquisitions as part of a bid to go global. Q: Who owns the majority of the company? A: its founder. Q: How many condoms will it sell this year?

Relations between Israel and its neighbours had never fully normalised following the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. In 1956 Israel invaded the Egyptian Sinai, with one of its objectives being the reopening of the Straits of Tiran which Egypt had blocked to Israeli shipping since 1950. Israel was subsequently forced to withdraw, but won a guarantee that the Straits of Tiran would remain open. Whilst the United Nations Emergency Force was deployed along the border, there was no demilitarisation agreement. 

In the period leading up to June 1967, tensions became dangerously heightened. Israel reiterated its post-1956 position that the closure of the straits of Tiran to its shipping would be a ""casus belli"" and in late May Nasser announced the straits would be closed to Israeli vessels. Egypt then mobilised its forces along its border with Israel, and on 5 June Israel launched what it claimed were a series of preemptive airstrikes against Egyptian airfields. Claims and counterclaims relating to this series of events are one of a number of controversies relating to the conflict. Q: When was the Six-Day War fought? A: June 5 and 10, 1967. Q: What is it called in Hebrew? A: Milhemet Sheshet Ha Yamim. Q: When did Isreal invade the Sinai? A: 1956. Q: What had been done to the Straits? A: Egypt had blocked them to Israeli shipping.

97,"The Arena Football League (AFL) is the highest level of professional indoor American football in the United States. It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League and the National Football League. It is played indoors on a 68-yard field (about half the distance of an NFL field), resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League. 

For its 2015 season, the league consisted of 12 teams, all from the United States; however, upon the completion of the regular season, the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie. Subsequently, one of the remaining teams, the Spokane Shock, severed its ties with the league to join the competing IFL. The AFL is divided into two conferences – the American Conference and National Conference. Starting 2016, each conference will have only four teams as the champion San Jose SaberCats announced in November 2015 that they were ceasing activity for ""reasons not associated with League operations.""

99,"Since the Protestant Reformation, the most prominent Christian denomination in Thuringia has been Lutheranism. During the GDR period, church membership was discouraged and has continued shrinking since the reunification in 1990. Today over two thirds of the population is non-religious. The Protestant Evangelical Church in Germany has had the largest number of members in the state, adhered to by 24.0% of the population in 2009. Members of the Catholic Church formed 7.8% of the population, while 68.2% of Thuringians were non-religious or adhere to other faiths. The highest Protestant concentrations are in the small villages of southern and western Thuringia, whereas the bigger cities are even more non-religious (up to 88% in Gera). Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany. Other religions play no significant role in Thuringia. There are only a few thousand Muslims (largely migrants) and about 750 Jews (mostly migrants from Russia) living in Thuringia. Furthermore, there are some Orthodox communities of Eastern European migrants and some traditional Protestant Free churches in Thuringia without any societal influence.

102,"Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. 

Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury. Q: What is the largest planet in the solar system? A: Jupiter. Q: What is it mostly made of? A: gas.

104,"(CNN) -- Major League Baseball on Monday suspended 13 players, including New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez, after an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs. 

The league suspended Rodriguez for 211 regular-season games through the 2014 season, but the 38-year-old slugger said he planned to appeal. Twelve other players have accepted 50-game suspensions without pay. 

A-Rod and the other players are accused of having ties to the now-shuttered Biogenesis anti-aging clinic in south Florida and taking performance-enhancing drugs. Rodriguez has denied the accusation. 

""I'm fighting for my life. I have to defend myself. If I don't defend myself, no one else will,"" he told reporters after the league announced its decision. 

Twitter reaction to A-Rod ban 

The last seven months have been a ""nightmare,"" he said. 

It ""has been probably the worst time of my life for sure,"" said Rodriguez, ""obviously for the circumstances that are at hand and also dealing with a very tough surgery and a rehab program, and being 38."" 

Asked directly whether he had used performance-enhancing drugs, he declined -- repeatedly -- to comment. 

""I think we'll have a forum to discuss all of that, and we'll talk about it then,"" Rodriguez said. 

Earlier in a written statement, he said that he was disappointed with the penalty and intends to appeal. He thanked family, friends and fans for their support and stressed that he was eager to get back on the field with his teammates. 

Timeline of Alex Rodriguez's rise and fall 

His suspension is set to go into effect on Thursday, the league said. But officials also said that Rodriguez could keep playing if he appeals.  Q: what question did Alex Rodreguez refuse to answer A: whether he had used performance-enhancing drugs. Q: was he asked just a single time? A: no. Q: when does the temporary ban start? A: Thursday,.

111,"CHAPTER XXVI 

THE JUDGMENT OF DOMITIAN 

Two hours had gone by and Caleb, with fury in his heart, sat brooding in the office attached to the warehouse that he had hired. At that moment he had but one desire--to kill his successful rival, Marcus. Marcus had escaped and returned to Rome; of that there could be no doubt. He, one of the wealthiest of its patricians, had furnished the vast sum which enabled old Nehushta to buy the coveted Pearl-Maiden in the slave-ring. Then his newly acquired property had been taken to this house, where he awaited her. This then was the end of their long rivalry; for this he, Caleb, had fought, toiled, schemed and suffered. Oh! rather than such a thing should be, in that dark hour of his soul, he would have seen her cast to the foul Domitian, for Domitian, at least, she would have hated, whereas Marcus, he knew, she loved. 

Now there remained nothing but revenge. Revenged he must be, but how? He might dog Marcus and murder him, only then his own life would be hazarded, since he knew well the fate that awaited the foreigner, and most of all the Jew, who dared to lift his hand against a Roman noble, and if he hired others to do the work they might bear evidence against him. Now Caleb did not wish to die; life seemed the only good that he had left. Also, while he lived he might still win Miriam--after his rival had ceased to live. Doubtless, then she would be sold with his other slaves, and he could buy her at the rate such tarnished goods command. No, he would do nothing to run himself into danger. He would wait, wait and watch his opportunity.  Q: What was now left? A: revenge. Q: Against who? A: Marcus. Q: What was in the angered man's heart? A: fury. Q: What was one option to get back at the man? A: dog and murder him. Q: What was a drawback to that plan? A: his own life would be hazarded. Q: What was the subject of their rivalry?

113,"Parents might tell older children to ""Act your age"". But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his words, if grown-ups really have superior brains, why don't we act as if we do? Q: What is a common saying that parents tell their kids? A: ""Act your age"". Q: Do scientists think it's accurate for parents to say this? A: yes. Q: Why do teens act immature when they appear to be grown up? A: Brain development continues into their twenties. Q: What area of the brain is still growing during this time? A: the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex. Q: What is its function? A: controls judgment and consideration of risk. Q: What behaviors show this lack of development? A: driving too fast.

115,"(CNN) -- Three Pakistani cricketers found guilty of corruption pleaded for leniency on Wednesday ahead of their sentencing in a British court. 

Former national captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir will discover their fate on Thursday, along with agent Mazhar Majeed. 

Majeed, like Amir, pleaded guilty after being caught accepting money from an undercover newspaper reporter to ""spot-fix"" outcomes during a Test match against England at Lord's in August 2010. 

Butt and Asif unsuccessfully tried to overturn charges that they both conspired to cheat and accept corrupt funds from Majeed, having been accused of agreeing to deliver three no-ball deliveries at specified times during the match. 

Former Pakistan captain blames ICC for corruption in cricket 

Majeed testified that he gave Asif £65,000 ($103,000) and also paid £10,000 ($16,000) to Butt and £2,500 ($4,000) to Amir after receiving £150,000 ($240,000) from a journalist working for the now defunct News of the World paper. 

The cheating charge carries a maximum sentence of two years plus an unlimited fine, while they could be jailed for seven years with an unlimited fine for accepting corrupt payments. 

Amir, a rising star in the sport at the age of 19, outlined his remorse in a statement read by his lawyer. 

""First I want to apologize to Pakistan and to everyone that cricket is important to,"" he said. ""I do know how much damage this has done to the game, a game which I love more than anything else in the world. 

""I did decide many months ago that I wanted to admit that I deliberately threw two no-balls at the Lord's Test last summer. But I know this was very late and I want to apologize for not saying it before. I didn't find the courage to do it at the beginning, and I know very well that made everything much more difficult.""

Valori, who is to be of Friedrich's Campaign this Year, came posting off directly in rear of the glorious news of Fontenoy; found Friedrich at Camenz, rather in spirits than otherwise; and lodged pleasantly with Abbot Tobias and him, till the Campaign should begin. Two things surprise Valori: first, the great strength, impregnable as it were, to which Neisse has been brought since he saw it last,--superlative condition of that Fortress, and of the Army itself, as it gathers daily more and more about Frankenstein here:--and then secondly, and contrariwise, the strangely neglected posture of mountainous or Upper Silesia, given up to Pandours. Quite submerged, in a manner: Margraf Karl lies quiet among them at Jagerndorf, ""eating his magazine;"" General Hautcharmoi (Winterfeld's late chief in that Wurben affair), with his small Detachment, still hovers about in those Ratibor parts, ""with the Strong Towns to fall-back upon,"" or has in effect fallen back accordingly; and nothing done to coerce the Pandours at all. While Prince Karl and Weissenfels are daily coming on, in force 100,000, their intention certain; force, say, about 100,000 regular! Very singular to Valori. 

""Sire, will not you dispute the Passes, then?"" asks Valori, amazed: ""Not defend your Mountain rampart, then?"" ""MON CHER; the Mountain rampart is three or four hundred miles long; there are twelve or twenty practicable roads through it. One is kept in darkness, too; endless Pandour doggery shutting out your daylight:--ill defending such a rampart,"" answers Friedrich. ""But how, then,"" persists Valori; ""but--?"" ""One day the King answered me,"" says Valori, ""'MON AMI, if you want to get the mouse, don't shut, the trap; leave the trap open (ON LAISSE LA SOURICIERE OUVERTE)!'"" Which was a beam of light to the inquiring thought of Valori, a military man of some intelligence. [See VALORI, i. 222, 224, 228.]  Q: How long is the Mountain rampart?

""We had our noses buried in books,""recalls Rick,""when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy. His bark was different from anything we had heard before.And he would not let us ignore him.""

""_Beatrice_. Is it possible Disdain should die while she has such meet food to feed her?"" 

_Much Ado about Nothing._ 

The Lyddell family did not continue in London much longer; it had been a short season, and though the session of Parliament was not over, most of the ladies were taking flight into the country, before the end of June,--Mrs. Lyddell among the rest,--and her husband went backwards and forwards to London, as occasion called him. 

The girls were glad to get into the country, but Marian soon found that she had not escaped either from gaieties, or from the objects of her aversion; for Mr. Faulkner brought his mother and sisters to High Down House, gave numerous parties there, and made a constant interchange of civilities with the family at Oakworthy. Archery was pretty much the fashion with the young ladies that year; it was a sport which Marian liked particularly, having often practised it with Edmund and Agnes, and her bow and arrows were always the first to be ready. 

One day when Marian, Caroline, and Clara were shooting on the lawn at Oakworthy, Mr. and Miss Faulkner rode from High Down, came out on the lawn, and joined them. From that moment, any one could see the change that came over Marian. Instead of laughing and talking, teaching Clara, and paying only half attention to her own shooting, she now went on as if it was her sole object, and as if she had no other purpose in life. She fixed her arrows and twanged her string with a rigidity as if the target had been a deadly enemy, or her whole fate was concentrated in hitting the bull's eye; and when her arrows went straight to the mark, or at least much straighter than those of any one else, she never turned her head, or vouchsafed more than the briefest answer to the exclamations around.  Q: Where did Mr Faulkner bring his mother and sisters?\ A: High Down House. Q: Did the Lyddells stay in London until Parliament was finished? A: No. Q: Where did the ladies go? A: into the country. Q: Before the end of which month? A: June. Q: Where did Mr Faulkner give parties? A: High Down House. Q: Where was the family he interacted with a lot? A: Oakworthy. Q: What was the fashionable sport that year/ A: Archery. Q: Did Marian like it? A: Yes. Q: Who did she practice with? A: Edmund and Agnes.

135,"Mumbai (; also known as Bombay, the official name until 1995) is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. It is the most populous city in India with an estimated city population of 18.4 million. Along with the neighbouring regions of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it is second most populous metropolitan area in India, with a population of 21.3 million . Mumbai lies on the Konkan on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. 

In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city. It is also the wealthiest city in India, Mumbai has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India. 

The seven islands that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of fishing colonies of the Koli people. For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay. During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project, which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea. Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.

About five o'clock that afternoon Ephraim was sitting in his shirt-sleeves by the window of his room, and Cynthia was reading aloud to him an article (about the war, of course) from a Washington paper, which his friend, Mr. Beard, had sent him. There was a knock at the door, and Cynthia opened it to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll in his hand. 

""Mistah Ephum Prescott?"" he said. 

""Yes,"" answered Ephraim, ""that's me."" 

Cynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as though he were afraid of its contents.

One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. 

Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up. 

""What are you doing?!"" asked the mouse in surprise. 

""I am trying to find dinner,"" said the cat. 

The mouse smiled. ""I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?"" 

The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. ""Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK."" 

The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness. Q: What color was the cat?

145,"Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli, such as stubbing a toe, burning a finger, putting alcohol on a cut, and bumping the ""funny bone"". Because it is a complex, subjective phenomenon, defining pain has been a challenge. The International Association for the Study of Pain's widely used definition states: ""Pain is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage."" In medical diagnosis, pain is a symptom. 

Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries. It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning. Psychological factors such as social support, hypnotic suggestion, excitement, or distraction can significantly affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness. In some arguments put forth in physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia debates, pain has been used as an argument to permit terminally ill patients to end their lives. Q: What type of feeling is caused by pain? A: a distressing feeling. Q: What is one type of stimuli that can trigger pain? A: stubbing a toe. Q: What is another example of a stimuli?

149,"(CNN) -- Chelsea's star striker Didier Drogba has been suffering from malaria, his club manager revealed on Tuesday, but the Ivory Coast player will still line up for the London derby against Fulham in the English Premier League on Wednesday. 

Drogba started on the bench for Chelsea's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, having missed recent matches against Aston Villa and Spartak Moscow due to a suspected virus. 

However, the results of blood tests showed that he had in fact contracted the tropical disease. 

""A test showed malaria,"" Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told his club's official website. ""He lost his condition, he lost power. 

""Didier had a difficulty to train because he didn't feel good, he didn't have power to train. He was unselfish to play also when he was not 100 percent."" 

But the Italian said Drogba was now back to health and would be fit for the league leaders' home clash with Fulham on Wednesday. 

""He suffered obviously but after treatment, he will be better,"" Ancelotti said. ""One time it was serious, now there is the possibility to treat and come back well. He is okay. Tomorrow he will play."" 

Ancelotti said Ghana midfielder Michael Essien would return to the Chelsea line-up, having missed the Liverpool game with a toe problem, but Frank Lampard is not yet ready to make his long-awaited return. 

The England midfielder, who has been sidelined following a hernia operation, is scheduled to make his comeback against Sunderland on Sunday.

161,"(CNN)Sri Lanka's current president Mahinda Rajapaksa has conceded defeat to rival Maithripala Sirisena in the country's presidential election, bringing an end to a decade of leadership increasingly criticized as corrupt and nepotistic. 

Rajapaksa acknowledged the defeat on his official Twitter account Friday, writing: ""I value and respect our democratic process and the people's verdict, and look forward to the peaceful transition of power."" 

Sirisena would be sworn in at 6 p.m. local time in Colombo's Independence Square, Dhanushka Ramanayake, the head of his media unit, said. 

The defeat of the once untouchable president, the longest-serving political leader in the region, was the result of a failed electoral gamble. 

In November, the 69-year-old called elections two years earlier than required, only to be shocked by the defection of many key political allies, including the man who would unseat him. 

The defections apparently wrong-footed Rajapaksa, and the opposition had the better of the campaign, say analysts. 

""He didn't expect the candidate to be Sirisena,"" said Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of Sri Lanka's Center for Policy Alternatives. 

""I think he probably underestimated the disaffection in the country and the desire for change."" 

Unexpected departure 

Sirisena, 63, served as general-secretary of Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Freedom Party and health minister in his cabinet, before switching allegiance to a broad opposition alliance that proved to be the former president's most serious political challenge. 

The unwieldy coalition includes the center-right United National Party, the hardline Sinhala Buddhist Jathika Hela Urumaya as well as parties representing the substantial Tamil and Muslim minorities.  Q: When will Sirisena be sworn in? A: 6 p.m local time. Q: Where? A: Colombo's Independence Square. Q: Where is that at? A: Sri Lanka. Q: Who did Sirisena beat in an election? A: Mahinda Rajapaksa.

169,"An atoll (, , , , or ), sometimes called a coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely. There may be coral islands/cays on the rim. The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water. The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera while the higher rim remains above water or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must be at a rate slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards to replace the lost height. 

The word ""atoll"" comes from the Dhivehi (an Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Maldive Islands) word ""atholhu"" (Dhivehi: , ), meaning an administrative subdivision. Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as ""atollon"" – Charles Darwin recognized its indigenous origin and coined, in his ""The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs"", the definition of atolls as ""circular groups of coral islets"" that is synonymous with ""lagoon-island"". 

More modern definitions of ""atoll"" describe them as ""annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus"" or ""in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon"". Q: what kind of coral reef is discussed? A: a coral atoll. Q: what shape is it? A: a ring. Q: what is another attribute? A: it encircles a lagoon. Q: where is the coral? A: atop the rim. Q: of what?

WITH THE MAYOS 

The news that Terence brought to the regiment gave great and general satisfaction. Herrara was delighted to hear that he was to be made a lieutenant-colonel in his army. Bull and Macwitty were overjoyed on hearing that they had both been recommended for commissions, and Herrara's troopers were equally pleased. The rank and file felt no less gratification, both at the honour of being attached to the British army, and at the substantial improvement in their condition that this would entail. 

On the following day Herrara's friends and Mary O'Connor left for Lisbon, and the latter astonished Terence by bursting into tears as she said good-bye to him. 

""I have said nothing yet of the gratitude that I feel to you, Terence, for all that you have done for me, for you have always stopped me whenever I have tried to, but I shall always feel it, always; and shall think of you and love you dearly."" 

""It has been just as fortunate for me as it has been good for you, Mary,"" he said. ""I have never had a sister, and I seem to have found one now.""

174,"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki began her latest bid for a first grand slam title with a 6-2 6-1 win over Anastasia Rodionova on Monday, joining last year's finalists Kim Clijsters and Li Na in the second round of the Australian Open. 

Top seed Wozniacki looked in good shape as she wrapped up victory against the Russia-born Australian in 76 minutes, but the Dane admitted she was worried about a wrist injury she suffered during last week's quarterfinal defeat at the Sydney International. 

""I was a bit nervous before the match. I didn't know exactly what to expect. But it feels better,"" the 21-year-old told the WTA Tour website. ""I'm very happy about the way I felt out there today. I got into the rhythm as the match went on tonight."" 

Who will be the 2012 Australian Open victors? 

Wozniacki will next play Georgia's 83rd-ranked Anna Tatishvili, who beat Australia's Ashleigh Barty 6-2 7-6 (7-4). 

Former No. 1 Clijsters made a strong start to the defense of her crown with a 7-5 6-1 defeat of Portuguese qualifier Maria Joao Koehler. 

The Belgian 11th seed, who will play France's world No. 98 Stephanie Foretz Gacon in the last 64, showed little sign of the hip injury which forced her out of the Brisbane International 10 days ago.

THE FITZGERALDS OF CASTLE RICHMOND. 

What idea of carrying out his plans may have been prevalent in Fitzgerald's mind when he was so defiant of the countess, it may be difficult to say. Probably he had no idea, but felt at the spur of the moment that it would be weak to yield. The consequence was, that when Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family. 

The young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even entertained him at Hap House; but the earl's pride would not give way an inch. 

""Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it. It would be a bad match for my sister, and so you'd feel if you were in my place."" And then Lord Desmond went back to Eton. 

After that they none of them met for many months. During this time life went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness to Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she not only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she returned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand. It was not that she had ceased to love him, but she had high ideas of truth and honour, and would not break her word. Perhaps she was sustained in her misery by the remembrance that heroines are always miserable.  Q: What is the chapter title? A: THE FITZGERALDS OF CASTLE RICHMOND. Q: Who is thinking about a plan?

188,"(CNN) -- It was in the majestic surroundings of Muirfield that the original gold-plated superstar of golf secured his first major title. 

The small town of Gullane to the east of Edinburgh that is all set to welcome the modern titans of the game for the 142nd staging of the British Open played host to a true pioneer back in 1896. 

Harry Vardon won a total of six British Open titles, a record that still stands, but his achievements in the game stretch far beyond his haul of majors, which was lifted to seven by his 1900 U.S. Open triumph. 

Not only was he credited with sparking an explosion of interest in the game during his tours of America at the turn of the 20th Century but he also devised the grip- -- ""the overlapping grip"" or the ""Vardon overlap"" -- that 90 percent of golfers still deploy. 

It is little wonder he is spoken of in such glowing terms by Australian Peter Thompson, who alongside American legend Tom Watson, is just one British Open triumph behind Vardon's half-dozen successes. 

""He was the God of golf,"" Thompson told CNN's Living Golf show. ""To aspire to such a position was sacrilege -- it was way out of my league. 

""It wasn't until I passed five that I thought, 'Well, it's possible to equal the great man' but I didn't do it, regrettably.

190,"This year marks the 100thanniversary of Leo Tolstoy's death. He is considered by many to be one of the greatest novelists of all time. Much of the West is marking the anniversary with new translations of the author's works, including War and Peace. Movies are being released, including a black-and-white documentary and a feature film. In short, everyone is celebrating. Everyone, that is, except for people in Tolstoy's home country, Russia. 

The English newspaper the Guardian reports that the Russian government has scheduled nothing for November, the official anniversary of Tolstoy's death. The quiet is amazing, considering the importance of this man's contribution to global culture. 

""Across the whole world there is a huge Tolstoy boom ,"" Andrei Deryabin, co-producer of a new film about the author's final days titled The Last Station, told the Guardian. ""He's esteemed everywhere apart from here in Russia."" 

Experts explain the government's silence in various ways. Some refer to Tolstoy's disagreement with state-backed religion. Tolstoy's Christian views often _ those of the Roman Catholic church. 

His great grandson, Vladimir Ilyich Tolstoy, thinks Russia's cool attitude has more to do with history and the author's positive worldview. After all, the last century was a difficult one of the country's people. The darker writings of Fyodor Dostoevsky, he says, better fit the national character. Tolstoy hopes that as Russians grow more optimistic they will rediscover one of their own national treasures.

Dan was his own man again in the morning, though rather pale and weak; he wanted to get up, but Cecily ordered him to stay in bed. Fortunately Felicity forgot to repeat the command, so Dan did stay in bed. Cecily carried his meals to him, and read a Henty book to him all her spare time. The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself. Sara's intentions were good, but the pudding-- well, Dan fed most of it to Paddy, who had curled himself up at the foot of the bed, giving the world assurance of a cat by his mellifluous purring. 

""Ain't he just a great old fellow?"" said Dan. ""He knows I'm kind of sick, just as well as a human. He never pays no attention to me when I'm well."" 

Felix and Peter and I were required to help Uncle Roger in some carpentering work that day, and Felicity indulged in one of the house-cleaning orgies so dear to her soul; so that it was evening before we were all free to meet in the orchard and loll on the grasses of Uncle Stephen's Walk. In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There was no such thing as hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of ""cabbages and kings."" A tale of the Story Girl's, wherein princes were thicker than blackberries, and queens as common as buttercups, led to our discussion of kings. We wondered what it would be like to be a king. Peter thought it would be fine, only kind of inconvenient, wearing a crown all the time.  Q: What did Sara Ray bring Dan? A: a pudding. Q: Were her intentions good? A: Yes. Q: How about the pudding?

210,"The Kingdom of Yugoslavia (, , ""Kingdom of South Slavia"") was a state in Southeast Europe and Central Europe, that existed during the interwar period (1918–1939) and first half of World War II (1939–1943). 

It was formed in 1918 by the merger of the provisional State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (itself formed from territories of the former Austro-Hungarian Empire) with the formerly independent Kingdom of Serbia. The Kingdom of Montenegro had united with Serbia five days previously, while the regions of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Vardar Macedonia were parts of Serbia prior to the unification. 

For its first eleven years of existence, the Kingdom was officially called the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, but the term ""Yugoslavia"" was its colloquial name from its origins. The official name of the state was changed to ""Kingdom of Yugoslavia"" by King Alexander I on 3 October 1929. 

The state was ruled by the Serbian dynasty of Karađorđević, which previously ruled the Kingdom of Serbia under Peter I from 1903 (after the May Overthrow) onwards. Peter I became the first king of Yugoslavia until his death in 1921. He was succeeded by his son Alexander I, who had been regent for his father. He was known as ""Alexander the Unifier"" and he renamed the kingdom ""Yugoslavia"" in 1929. He was assassinated in Marseille by Vlado Chernozemski, a member of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO), during his visit to France in 1934. The crown passed to his then-still under-aged son Peter. His cousin Paul ruled as Prince regent until 1941, when Peter II would come of age.

One after another, the next six drivers arriving at the tollbooth were informed, ""Some lady up ahead already paid your fare."" 

It turned out that the woman, Natalie Smith, had read something on a friend's refrigerator: ""Practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty."" The phrase impressed her so much that she copied it down. 

Judy Foreman spotted the same phrase on a warehouse wall far away from home. When it stayed on her mind for days, she gave up and drove all the way back to copy it down.

Her husband, Frank, liked the phrase so much that he put it up on the classroom wall for his students, one of whom was the daughter of Alice Johnson, a local news reporter. Alice put it in the newspaper, admitting that though she liked it, she didn't know where it came from or what it really meant. 

Two days later, Alice got a call from Anne Herbert, a woman living in Marin. It was in a restaurant that Anne wrote the phrase down on a piece of paper, after turning it around in her mind for days.

213,"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. 

Will the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. 

The court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. 

Has the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. 

Among freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear.

Bernard Maddison kept his engagement that evening, and dined alone with Lady Thurwell and Helen. There had been some talk of going to the opera afterwards, but no one seemed to care about it, and so it dropped through. 

""For my part,"" Lady Thurwell said, as they sat lingering over their dessert, ""I shall quite enjoy an evening's rest. You literary men, Mr. Maddison, talk a good deal about being overworked, but you know nothing of the life of a chaperon in the season. I tell Helen that she is sadly wanting in gratitude. We do everything worth doing--picture galleries, matinées, shopping, afternoon calls, dinners, dances, receptions--why, there's no slavery like it."" 

Helen laughed softly. 

""We do a great deal too much, aunt,"" she said. ""I am almost coming round to my father's opinion. You know, Mr. Maddison, he very seldom comes to London, and then only when he wants to pay a visit to his gunmaker, or to renew his hunting kit, or something of that sort.

She looked thoughtful. 

""Yes, I suppose, ethically, the life of a man about town is on a very low level. That is why one meets so few who interest one, as a rule. Don't you think all this society life very frivolous, Mr. Maddison?""

220,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film ""Do the Right Thing,"" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. 

Spike Lee: ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" 

""This movie is dynamite under every seat,"" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. 

Other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. 

Instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. ""Do the Right Thing"" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. 

Twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: ""Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,"" he wrote in 2001. 

So what is the thing about ""Do the Right Thing?"" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words » 

Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, ""She's Gotta Have It"" (1986) and ""School Daze"" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was ""Do the Right Thing,"" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.

224,"Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. 

A region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. 

The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. 

Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, ""a 3°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones"".

It was not many days after her mother's arrival that Gwendolen would consent to remain at Genoa. Her desire to get away from that gem of the sea, helped to rally her strength and courage. For what place, though it were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a circle of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of flame-tongues burning the soles of our feet? 

""I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,"" said Gwendolen, to her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child's feeling--even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to her late husband. 

Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she had ever done since her daughter's marriage.

It was not many days after her mother's arrival that Gwendolen would consent to remain at Genoa. Her desire to get away from that gem of the sea, helped to rally her strength and courage. For what place, though it were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a circle of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of flame-tongues burning the soles of our feet? 

""I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,"" said Gwendolen, to her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child's feeling--even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to her late husband. 

Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she had ever done since her daughter's marriage. It seemed that her darling was brought back to her not merely with all the old affection, but with a conscious cherishing of her mother's nearness, such as we give to a possession that we have been on the brink of losing.

229,"Chapter XL. Keep Your Temper. 

On the next day but one, Randal arranged his departure for Sydenham, so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner. His prospects of success, in pleading for a favorable reception of his brother's message, were so uncertain that he refrained--in fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justify--from taking Herbert into his confidence. No one knew on what errand he was bent, when he left the house. As he took his place in the carriage, the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual. The new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published. Randal bought it. 

After reading one or two of the political articles, he arrived at the columns specially devoted to ""Fashionable Intelligence."" Caring nothing for that sort of news, he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles, when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye. He read the paragraph in which it appeared. 

""The charming widow, Mrs. Norman, is, we hear, among the distinguished guests staying at Buck's Hotel. It is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of Arctic fame; now better known, perhaps, as one of our leading philanthropists."" 

The allusion to Bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken. Randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph. ""The charming widow!"" Was it possible that this last word referred to Catherine? To suppose her capable of assuming to be a widow, and--if the child asked questions--of telling Kitty that her father was dead, was, in Randal's estimation, to wrong her cruelly. With his own suspicions steadily contradicting him, he arrived at the hotel, obstinately believing that ""the charming widow"" would prove to be a stranger.  Q: how many articles were read ? A: one or two. Q: what kind ? A: political. Q: where were the guest staying ? A: Buck's Hotel. Q: what kind of guest ? A: distinguished. Q: who is charming ?

Bobby, the robot mail carrier, brings mail to a large office building in Washington, D.C. He is one of 250 robot mail carriers in the United States. Mr. Leachim, who weights two hundred pounds and is six feet tall, has some advantages as a teacher. One is that he does not forget details. He knows each child's name, their parents' names, and what each child knows and needs to know. In addition, he knows each child's pets and hobbies. Mr. Leachim does not make mistakes. Each child goes and tells him his or her name, then dials an identification number. His computer brain puts the child's voice and number together. He identifies the child with no mistakes. 

Another advantage is that Mr. Leachim is flexible. If the children need more time to do their lessons they can move switches. In this way they can repeat Mr. Leachim's lesson over and over again. When the children do a good job, he tells them something interesting about their hobbies. At the end of the lesson the children switch Mr. Leachim off. Q: how tall is Mr. Leachim? A: Six feet.

246,"The Christian Science Monitor (CSM) is an international news organization that delivers global coverage via its website, weekly magazine, daily news briefing, email newsletters, Amazon Kindle subscription, and mobile site. It was started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist. , the print circulation was 75,052. 

The ""Monitor"" is a newspaper that covers international and United States current events. The paper includes a daily religious feature on ""The Home Forum"" page, but states the publication is not a platform for evangelizing. 

In 2008 the ""Monitor"" discontinued its daily print version to focus on web-based publishing, replacing its daily print edition with a weekly news magazine with an international focus. Mark Sappenfield became the editor in March of 2017. 

Despite its name, the ""Monitor"" does not claim to be a religious-themed paper, and says it does not promote the doctrine of its patron church. However, at its founder Eddy's request, a daily religious article has appeared in every issue of the ""Monitor"". Eddy also required the inclusion of ""Christian Science"" in the paper's name, over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a secular audience. 

The ""Monitor""'s inception was, in part, a response by Eddy to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy. In addition, Joseph Pulitzer's ""New York World"" was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in ""McClure's"", furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.

The only man who has any business to possess a weapon is the ruler of a country--myself, for instance.

Subject to the controls of the International Olympic Committee, NOCs are responsible for organizing their people's participation in the Olympic Games. They may nominate cities within their respective areas as candidates for future Olympic Games. NOCs also promote the development of athletes and training of coaches and officials at a national level within their geographies. 

As of 2016, there are 206 NOCs: Each of the 193 member states of the United Nations; United Nations observer state Palestine; the Cook Islands, a state in free association with New Zealand whose capacity to participate in international organizations has been recognized by the United Nations Secretariat; and two states with limited recognition, Kosovo and Taiwan (designated as ""Chinese Taipei"" by the IOC). 

There are also nine dependent territories with NOCs: 

Prior to 1996, rules for recognising separate countries within the IOC were not as strict as those within the United Nations, which allowed these territories to field teams separately from their sovereign state. Following an amendment to the Olympic Charter in 1996, NOC recognition can only be granted after recognition as an independent state by the international community. Since the rule does not apply retroactively, the dependent territories which were recognised before the rule change are allowed to continue sending separate teams to the Olympics, while the Faroe Islands and Macau send their own Paralympic teams.

Jerry Muskrat was more and more sure that his big cousin, Paddy the Beaver, didn't know quite so much as he might about house-building. Jerry would have liked to offer some suggestions, but he didn't quite dare. You see, he was very anxious not to displease his big cousin. But he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build. Sure enough, Peter was there, sitting up very straight and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work.

It was a stone-flagged room upon the second floor, with a bed in a recess for him, and two smaller pallets on the other side, on which Aylward and Hordle John were already snoring. Alleyne had knelt down to his evening orisons, when there came a tap at his door, and Ford entered with a small lamp in his hand. His face was deadly pale, and his hand shook until the shadows flickered up and down the wall.

274,"(CNN) -- Who is Stanislas Cordova? That's the burning question at the heart of ""Night Film,"" the anticipated follow-up to best-selling author Marisha Pessl's 2006 literary debut. 

Pessl burst onto the scene in 2006 with ""Special Topics in Calamity Physics."" She received a six-figure advance, almost unheard of for a first-time author, a ton of hype and even some snarky backlash over her photogenic looks. But the book lived up to expectations, selling some 200,000 copies and landing on The New York Times' list of Best Books of 2006. 

Seven years later, ""Night Film"" is hitting bookstores this week amid greater expectations and even more hype. Movie rights are already spoken for by Chernin Entertainment, the studio behind ""Oblivion"" and ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes,"" and critics are raving about Pessl's multimedia storytelling approach, which takes readers beyond the novel's pages to explore the story of a mysterious director and the washed-up reporter out to expose him. 

Pessl's fictional mash-up of Stanley Kubrick, Roman Polanski and David Lynch hasn't been seen in public for 30 years. His movies are so frightening no theater will show them; his cult of fans meet in abandoned buildings and underground tunnels for secret screenings. 

Investigative journalist Scott McGrath tried to expose Cordova years ago and it backfired, costing him his job, marriage and reputation. When Cordova's daughter turns up dead in an apparent suicide, McGrath sees an opportunity to exact revenge against the man he blames for his downfall. 

Pessl weaves into the narrative excerpts from magazine articles, newspaper headlines, police reports, crime scene photos and screen shots of online message boards. She also wrote and directed several short films being featured over the next few weeks on YouTube that offer clues into the book's mystery, including snippets and trailers from Cordova's films.

289,"A great loss--Shirley Temple dies at 85 

February 12,2014 

BYDERRIKJ.LANG ,Associated Press 

Shirley Temple Black, who died on February 10that age 85, wasn't just a child star. She was THE child star--the sweet little girl whose shining smile helped _ some of the darkest days the US has known during the Great Depression. 

It's hard today to imagine the super star Shirley was once ""America's Little Darling"". She sang and danced her way to the top of the box office in such films as Bright Eyes, Curly Top and Heidi. By 1940, she had appeared in 43 films. Temple teamed with Bill Robison in four movies, and their dance on the stairs in The Little Colonel is still a legendary film moment. 

In the 1930s, her name on a movie introduction assured a packed house. She inspired dolls, dresses, dishes--even a drink (alcohol-free, of course). 

US President Franklin D. Roosevelt once famously said that ""as long as our country has Shirley Temple, we will be all right.'' 

Unlike so many of today's child stars, Temple didn't end up with her name appearing across the headlines for bad behaviors. Instead of getting her photos on front pages or struggling with drugs and alcohol, Temple went on to a second career in diplomacy , including presidential appointments as ambassador to Ghana. 

She surprised a lot of people who doubted her with her grace, knowledge and eagerness to serve. In fact, her career in public service (20 years) was longer than her career in movies (19). The role she valued most, however, was as wife, mother, grandmother and great-grandmother. 

The world has lost a treasured Hollywood legend. But her movies will allow that little dynamic figure to continue charming audiences for a very long time. Q: Who is this news story about? A: Shirley Temple Black. Q: In what industry did she become famous? A: Entertainment. Q: How many movies did she appear in? A: 43 films. Q: Any examples? A: Bright Eyes, Curly Top. Q: Did she continue to act her whole life? A: No. Q: What else did she do? A: Second career in diplomacy. Q: Would you say her family or carrer was more important to her?

302,"Las Vegas (CNN)Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch were neighbors. Their homes are walking distance from each other and from a park. 

It was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. 

On Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. 

""We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before,"" Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. ""He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends."" 

Nowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. 

Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch. 

""My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy,"" he said. ""She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man. More times than I can count."" 

Police said they are looking for at least one more suspect, but they believe Nowsch was the shooter. Homicide Capt. Chris Tomaino told reporters that he owned registered firearms but wouldn't say how many guns or what type of weapons they were. 

It was unclear Thursday night whether Nowsch had an attorney; court documents detailing his charges didn't list a lawyer.  Q: Who were neighbors? A: Tammy Meyers and Erich Nowsch.

""Oh, Boscoe!"" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way. 

One of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. 

All of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, ""Boscoe!"" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river! 

As Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river.

314,"(CNN) -- Smart, successful, funny and handsome. Robin Williams seemed to have it all. And yet, today he is dead. Apparently, by his own choice. 

But why? What went wrong? 

The joy, spontaneity and humor of Robin Williams likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on-again-off-again struggle with depression. He made us laugh out here, but he was in pain in there. Unfortunately, I know that pain. 

In his death, we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet. Still, his death by suicide should be a wake-up call for us all. It is to remind us that many of us are walking a fine line -- smiling on the outside while slowly dying on the inside. 

I didn't know Robin personally, so I am unable to speak with any certainty as to why he chose to end his life. But I have experienced that kind of torment and pain. For years, I, too, struggled with depression. And many days, I still do.

319,"Plymouth (i/ˈplɪməθ/) is a city on the south coast of Devon, England, about 37 miles (60 km) south-west of Exeter and 190 miles (310 km) west-south-west of London, between the mouths of the rivers Plym to the east and Tamar to the west where they join Plymouth Sound to form the boundary with Cornwall. 

Plymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age, when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten. This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony – the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. 

Throughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status. The city's naval importance later led to its targeting and partial destruction during World War II, an act known as the Plymouth Blitz. After the war the city centre was completely rebuilt and subsequent expansion led to the incorporation of Plympton and Plymstock along with other outlying suburbs in 1967. Q: What grew as a commercial port during the Industrial Revolution? A: Plymouth. Q: What is it located on the south coast of? A: Devon. Q: In what country? A: England.

Powell was again the first to throw the hammer and this time it went two feet beyond his first mark. 

""Good for you, Songbird!"" said Tom. ""I wish you had made it a yard."" 

Jackson came up with a scowling face. He did his best, but this time fell behind Powell by four inches. 

""You ought to have stuck to the other hammer, Jackson,"" laughed the youth who composed songs. 

""Don't you throw that up to me!"" whispered Jackson fiercely. ""If you do I'll hammer you for it."" 

""Is that meant for a pun, Jackson?"" 

""No, it ain't. I won't stand being slurred. I'll pound you good.""

Larson was as much out of sorts as Jackson, but nevertheless he resolved to do his best to win the contest. Up went the hammer with a mighty swing and circled through the air. But the throw was behind that of Tom by fourteen inches. 

""Hurrah! Tom Rover wins!"" was the cry, and many rushed forward to congratulate him, while Larson and Jackson retired as quickly as they could and in great disgust.

341,"London (CNN) -- Janet Jackson is opening up for the first time about a duet with her brother that she's reviving two years after his death. 

Jackson took to the stage in London on Thursday and performed their 1995 song Scream as video of Michael Jackson played and his voice filled Royal Albert Hall. 

The reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole and his daughter, Natalie Cole. In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording ""Unforgettable"" into a father-daughter duet. 

Janet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. 

""I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails,"" she said. ""And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about."" 

Jackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult.

350,"(CNN) -- There are plenty of country songs about how to be a man. One way is to face the music, and two country crooners did that on Thursday. 

Ty Herndon and Billy Gilman came out as being gay. 

Herdon went first, in interviews with People Magazine and Entertainment Tonight. His revelation inspired Gilman to do go public as well. 

Gilman posted a message to YouTube, thanking Herndon for breaking the ice. He preferred telling his fans directly, from the comfort of home, to sitting down with the press, he said. 

But an encounter with a journalist also prodded him to spill the beans before someone else did. The reporter bumped into Gilman in a public place and snapped a photo of him -- with his partner. 

""It was in that moment that I knew that I'd rather it be from me than you reading it somewhere else,"" Gilman told fans. He also feared being ripped over his sexuality in an article. 

Country and LGBTQ 

In the genre of country, Thursday's tune was a tough one to sing, Gilman said. ""Being a gay, male country artist is not the best thing."" 

At age 26, he's had a long career, having rocketed up the charts at age 11 with his then silky, pre-voice-change alto pipes, according to his biography on AllMusic.com. 

But currently, he's hitting snags. 

Rumors about his sexual orientation have been going around, he said, and he thinks major music labels may have thumbed their noses at him over it.  Q: Who came out? A: Ty Herndon and Billy Gilman.

351,"Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. 

During the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3 million. 

Today, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area.

It is a peninsula, bordered on the north and east by the state of New York; on the east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania; and on the southwest by the Delaware Bay and Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state by area but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest state by median household income as of 2016. 

New Jersey was inhabited by Native Americans for more than 2,800 years, with historical tribes such as the Lenape along the coast. In the early 17th century, the Dutch and the Swedes made the first European settlements in the state. The English later seized control of the region, naming it the Province of New Jersey after the largest of the Channel Islands, Jersey, and granting it as a colony to Sir George Carteret and John Berkeley, 1st Baron Berkeley of Stratton.

358,"A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. 

The study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. 

Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. 

Now, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. 

In the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . 

Dr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been ""educated"" by early exposure to germs. 

Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their doctors. 

Rob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing. ""Wash your hands , but don't do it with antibacterial soap. Let your kids play in a reasonable amount of dirt and get outside and get exposed to a diversity of things"", says Rob Dunn.

362,"(CNN) -- A man who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon attack is engaged to the woman he was waiting for at the finish line. 

Jeff Bauman, 28, is also expected a child this summer with fiancee Erin Hurley, 27, according to an announcement on his foundation's Facebook page: 

""We are so happy to share with you exciting news that has happened over the last few months...Jeff and Erin became engaged and are expecting their first child in the summer!!! Congratulations Jeff and Erin!!"" 

The posting did not reveal a due date for the child or a wedding date. 

Bauman is credited with helping investigators identify the suspects in the April 15, 2013, double bombing. 

The image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. 

A day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. 

Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. 

Bauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled ""Stronger"" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. 

""The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals,"" he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.

364,"George Washington Carver showed that plant life was more than just food for animals and humans. Carver's first step was to analyze plant parts to find out what they were made of. He then combined these simpler isolated substances with other substances to create new products. 

The branch of chemistry that studies and finds ways to use raw materials from farm products to make industrial products is called chemurgy. Carver was one of the first and greatest chemurgists of all time. Today the science of chemurgy is better known as the science of synthetics . Each day people depend on and use synthetics made from raw materials. All his life Carver battled against the disposal of waste materials, and warned of the growing need to develop substitutes for the natural substances being used up by humans. 

Carver never cared about getting credit for the new products he created. He never tried to patent his discoveries or get wealthy from them. He turned down many offers to leave Tuskegee Institute to become a scientist in private industry. Thomas Edison, inventor of the electric light, offered him a laboratory in Detroit to carry out food research. When the United States government made him a collaborator in the Mycology and Plant Disease Survey of the Department of Agriculture, he accepted the position with the understanding that he wouldn't leave Tuskegee.

THE CHARLATAN UNMASKED 

There seemed for the next few minutes to be a somewhat singular abstention from any desire to interfere with the two people who stood in the centre of the little group, hand-in-hand. Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her. 

Even Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him. 

Still retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester. 

""You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester,"" he said. ""One of your conditions I have obeyed. With regard to the other, I have done as I thought fit. However, to-day she is her own mistress. She has consented to be my wife. I do not need to ask for your consent or approval.

377,"Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature () has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced ""in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction"" (original Swedish: ""den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning""). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here ""work"" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. 

Although the Nobel Prize in Literature has become the world's most prestigious literature prize, the Swedish Academy has attracted significant criticism for its handling of the award. Many authors who have won the prize have fallen into obscurity, while others rejected by the jury remain widely studied and read, like Ruben Darío. The prize has ""become widely seen as a political one - a peace prize in literary disguise"", whose judges are prejudiced against authors with different political tastes to them. Tim Parks has expressed skepticism that it is possible for ""Swedish professors ... [to] compar[e] a poet from Indonesia, perhaps translated into English with a novelist from Cameroon, perhaps available only in French, and another who writes in Afrikaans but is published in German and Dutch..."". As of 2016, 16 of the 113 recipients have been of Scandinavian origin. The Academy has often been alleged to be biased towards European, and in particular Swedish, authors. Some, such as Indian academic Sabaree Mitra, have noted that, though the Nobel Prize in Literature is significant and tends to overshadow other awards, it is ""not the only benchmark of literary excellence.""

383,"For millions of years, sharks have been the kings of the oceans, the top of the food chain. But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. 

Shark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. 

The competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. 

""I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,"" he said. ""If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow."" 

That is exactly what marine biologists like Luke Tipple want to happen. ""I believe that they should just stop it.

For some time after the conclusion of the race, Bashti stood talking with his head men, Agno among them. Lenerengo was similarly engaged with several old cronies. As Jerry lay off to one side where she had forgotten him, the wild-dog he had bullied on the _Arangi_ came up and sniffed at him. At first he sniffed at a distance, ready for instant flight. Then he drew cautiously closer. Jerry watched him with smouldering eyes. At the moment wild-dog's nose touched him, he uttered a warning growl. Wild-dog sprang back and whirled away in headlong flight for a score of yards before he learned that he was not pursued. 

Again he came back cautiously, as it was the instinct in him to stalk wild game, crouching so close to the ground that almost his belly touched. He lifted and dropped his feet with the lithe softness of a cat, and from time to time glanced to right and to left as if in apprehension of some flank attack. A noisy outburst of boys' laughter in the distance caused him to crouch suddenly down, his claws thrust into the ground for purchase, his muscles tense springs for the leap he knew not in what direction, from the danger he knew not what that might threaten him. Then he identified the noise, know that no harm impended, and resumed his stealthy advance on the Irish terrier. 

What might have happened there is no telling, for at that moment Bashti's eyes chanced to rest on the golden puppy for the first time since the capture of the _Arangi_. In the rush of events Bashti had forgotten the puppy.  Q: What had been bullied? A: A wild-dog. Q: Who bullied it? A: Jerry. Q: What breed was he? A: Irish terrier. Q: Did the wild dog approach?

389,"Einstein's connection with the politics of the nuclear bomb is well known: He signed the letter to President Franklin Roosevelt that persuaded the United States to take the idea seriously, and he engaged in postwar efforts to prevent nuclear war. But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, ""divided between politics and equations ."" 

Sickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. 

Einstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. 

His theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, ""If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!"" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline ""Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back."" 

Fearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own. But he was publicly warning of the dangers of nuclear war and proposing international control of nuclear weaponry. Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952, when he was offered the presidency of Israel. He declined, saying he was too naive in politics. But perhaps his real reason was different:"" Equations are more important to me, because politics is for the present, but an equation is something for eternity."" Q: What religion was Einstein? A: Jewish. Q: Was he very religious? A: no. Q: Why did he support Zionism then? A: his growing awareness of anti-Semitism. Q: When did that start happening? A: before and during the War. Q: Were Einstein's theories widely accepted? A: no. Q: What was one man fined for conspiring to kill Einstein? A: six dollars. Q: Where did he go when Hitler rose through the ranks? A: America. Q: Was he looking forward to going back to Germany?

""100,000 euros (about $129,800) was our starting price,"" Oleg Zhuravsky, co-owner of Liga Stavok -- ""Bet League"" in Russian -- told CNN. He said the offer could be increased if need be -- ""We are bookmakers, after all."" 

Paul currently lives at the Sea Life Center in Oberhausen, Germany. Zhuravsky said a representative of the center's public relations firm has told him the offer has been received and ""they are studying it."" 

However, the firm, Dederichs Reinecke and Parner, said it declined the Russian offer and that Paul will not be sold to anyone. 

""Seriously speaking, we want the octopus for a number of purposes,"" Zhuravsky said. ""First, to see whether he can indeed effectively forecast the results of the football games. Secondly, Paul could become a good mascot, a good symbol for my bookmaking companies. And thirdly, he has an international fame like perhaps no other animal across the world does these days, and I'd love to be able to move him to Russia. 

""Both kids and adults, I'm sure, would love to see him here,"" he said. ""We are even prepared to put him in the Moscow City Aquarium if that were the condition.""

THE BATTLE IN THE PLAIN 

The distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of the chamber beneath it could not have been great, for all three of the victims of Tario's wrath alighted unscathed. 

Carthoris, still clasping Thuvia tightly to his breast, came to the ground catlike, upon his feet, breaking the shock for the girl. Scarce had his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready for instant use. But though the room was lighted, there was no sign of enemy about. 

Carthoris looked toward Jav. The man was pasty white with fear. 

""What is to be our fate?"" asked the Heliumite. ""Tell me, man! Shake off your terror long enough to tell me, so I may be prepared to sell my life and that of the Princess of Ptarth as dearly as possible.""

""From thence will he come upon us. Lay aside your puny sword, fool. It will but enrage him the more and make our sufferings the worse.""

Presently Jav gave a horrified moan, at the same time pointing toward the door.

NELLIE ARDELL'S TROUBLES. 

On the following morning Jerry went to work at the bindery as if nothing had happened. When he went in, Dick Lanning glared at our hero and stopped as if to speak, but changed his mind and walked off without saying a word. 

During the day the young oarsman became much better acquainted with his work and began to like it. 

That night, on leaving the bindery by the side entrance, which opened on a narrow lane, our hero saw Dick Lanning and several of his friends waiting for him. 

He attempted to pass but Lenning put out his foot, and had Jerry not stopped he would have been tripped up. 

""Let me pass,"" said he, sharply, but instead of complying, Lenning took a stand in front of him and hit the youth on the shoulder. 

""I said I'd git square,"" he hissed, savagely. ""If yer ain't afraid, stand up and fight."" 

""I'm not afraid,"" replied Jerry, and pushed him up against the wall. 

Without delay a rough-and-tumble fight ensued. 

""Give it to him, Dick!"" 

""Do the hayseed up!"" 

""Knock him into the middle of next week!"" 

These and a dozen other cries arose on the air, and the crowd kept increasing until fully a hundred spectators surrounded the pair.

Christian Bale is known as a hard worker who immerses himself in his characters. 

Batman? Try Christian Bale. 

Though in his case the armor and mask are metaphorical, the 34-year-old ""Dark Knight"" star likes to keep his personal life as shadowy as a superhero's back story. He's been known to keep a low profile -- ""You will never see me at a party,"" he told the Times of London -- and delights in concocting stories about his life. 

""I make up [things],"" he told Details magazine earlier this year. ""Absolutely. I'm an actor -- I'm not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things. I'll enjoy chatting now and then later I'll regret it."" 

But with the explosive impact of ""The Dark Knight"" -- the film has set box office records in the 10 days since its release, becoming the fastest film to reach the $300 million mark in history -- and the forthcoming release of the fourth ""Terminator,"" which will star Bale, he may find his privacy limited. (""The Dark Knight"" is a Warner Bros. film. The studio, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) 

""Can he stand the glare of the spotlight?"" a rival studio executive asked Entertainment Weekly. ""Being put in major roles and major films?"" 

Already there are signs that Bale has made the jump from actor to movie star. Last week, news of an alleged hotel-room tussle between the actor, his mother and his sister made headlines around the world.

Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. 

""Futsal"" comes from Spanish ""fútbol sala or fútbol de salón"" and from Portuguese ""futebol de salão"". The term is commonly translated as ""indoor football"" but a more literal translation is ""hall/lounge football"". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name ""fútbol sala"" was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to ""futsal"". The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of ""fútbol"", FIFUSA has registered the word ""fut-sal"" in 1985 (Madrid, Spain). Since then FIFA has also started using the term futsal. The name has been translated into Italian as ""calcio a 5"" or ""football sala"", and French as ""football de salle"". Q: What languages does the word futsal come from? A: Spanish and Portuguese. Q: What is the translation in English? A: big room soccer. Q: What ground is it played on? A: a hard court surface.

Q: What is the French version of the word? A: ""football de salle"". Q: What was it called in 1985? A: ""fútbol sala"". Q: What happened to its name after that? A: changed to ""futsal"".

THE RESCUE--CONCLUSION 

The Rovers and the others on the steam tug could scarcely wait for the old man in the dilapidated rowboat to come up alongside. 

""You have a message for us?"" said Dick. ""Hand it over, quick."" 

""The message says as how you-uns will pay me twenty-five dollars fer delivering of it in twenty-four hours,"" said the old man, cautiously. 

""Who is it from?"" 

""It is signed Dora Stanhope and Nellie Laning."" 

""Give it to me--I'll pay you the money,"" cried Tom. 

""All right, reckon as how I kin trust you-uns,"" said the old man. 

It was Jake Shaggam, who had received the message the evening before. He had read it with interest and started out at daylight to find out something about the Rovers and where they might be located. Good fortune had thrown him directly in our young friends' way. 

""This is really a message from the girls!"" cried Tom, reading it hastily. ""It is in Nellie Laning's handwriting."" 

""And Dora Stanhope has signed her name too,"" added Dick. ""I know her signature well."" 

""Of course you do,"" put in Fred, dryly, but nobody paid attention to the sally. 

""They are on the houseboat, and the craft is hidden up Shaggam Creek,"" put in Sam. He turned to the captain of the tug. ""Where is Shaggam Creek?""

LITTLE NELL--CONCLUSION 

Jean Bevoir was now thoroughly cowed, and once having exposed himself he did all in his power to curry favor with those he had so deeply wronged, in the hope that they would relent in their treatment of him and perhaps grant him his ultimate liberty. But neither Henry nor the others would make him any promises, for nobody had any intention of letting him go free. 

""He deserves to become a prisoner,"" said Dave. ""And he ought to be put in solitary confinement and on bread and water."" 

""Right ye are, lad,"" said Barringford. ""He's wuss nor a snake in the grass. I don't wonder Henry felt like pepperin' him on the spot."" 

It was well along in the middle of the afternoon and the rangers who had been out on the hunt were thoroughly tired, yet it was arranged that those who had remained in camp should move to the cave near the falls without delay, after getting minute directions from Jean Bevoir, so that there should be no chance of making a mistake in the route. A strict guard was ordered over the trader and he was given to understand that if anything went wrong with those who set out on the search for little Nell and the others the blame would fall upon him. 

It must be said that the hearts of both Henry and Dave beat rapidly as they pushed along the trail leading towards the falls. Henry, as we know, loved his little sister dearly, and Dave's affection for his little cousin was scarcely less strong. Throughout the whole campaign there had not been a day when they had not thought of her and of what she must be suffering.  Q: What did Dave think Jean deserved? A: To become a prisoner. Q: Where did he think they should put him? A: In solitary confinement. Q: Would he be allowed to eat? A: Bread and water. Q: Who agreed with him? A: Barringford. Q: Who wanted to shoot Jean?

""The Laughing Brook is merry And so am I,"" cried Jerry. Grandfather Frog said he was too. And Spotty was, the others knew. 

The trees stood with wet feet where just a little while before had been the strange pond in the Green Forest, the pond made by the dam of Paddy the Beaver. In the dam was a great hole made by Paddy himself. 

Through the Green Forest rang the laughter of the Laughing Brook, for once more the water ran deep between its banks. And in the hearts of Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Spotty the Turtle was laughter also, for now the Smiling Pool would smile once more, and they could go home in peace and happiness. And there was one more who laughed. Who was it? Why, Paddy the Beaver to be sure, and his was the best laugh of all, for it was because he had brought happiness to others. 

""You beat me up here to the dam, but you won't beat me back to the Smiling Pool,"" cried Jerry Muskrat to Spotty the Turtle. 

Spotty laughed good-naturedly. ""You'd better not stop to eat or play or sleep on the way then,"" said he, ""for I shall keep right on going all the time. I've found that is the only way to get anywhere."" 

""Let us all go down together"" said Grandfather Frog. ""We can help each other over the bad places."" 

Jerry Muskrat laughed until he had to hold his sides at the very thought of Grandfather Frog or Spotty the Turtle being able to help him, but he is very good-natured, and so he agreed that they should all go down together.

MAXIMUS--DEER SPEARING--A SURPRISINGLY BAD SHOT--CHARACTER OF THE NATIVES. 

""Hallo! what have we here?"" exclaimed Stanley, starting from his seat in amazement, as the giant entered the hall of Fort Chimo--his left hand grasping a blood-stained wolf by the throat, and Edith resting in his right arm. 

At first the startled father imagined his child must have been wounded, if not killed, by the savage animal; but his mind was immediately relieved on this point by Edith herself, who was no sooner laid on her bed than she recovered sufficiently to narrate the circumstances attending her fall. 

""Well, Maximus,"" said Stanley, returning to the hall and applying to the bulky savage the term that seemed most appropriate to him, ""shake hands with me, my good fellow. You've saved Chimo's life, it seems; and that's a good turn I'll not forget. But a--. I see you don't understand a word I say. Hallo!

""Hold thy tongue, Moses, and ask the fellow where he came from; but tell him first that I'm obliged to him for saving Chimo from that villainous wolf.""

With only 300 cronuts made each day sold at $5 a pop, they are so coveted that they can go for up to $40 on the pastry black market. Even supermodel Heidi Klum had to wait weeks to try one. 

Though the cronut has gained worldwide attention on social media since its debut in May, few in the UK have had the chance to taste the unique pastry -- until now. 

""It just went viral because it's new,"" Dominique Ansel told CNN'. ""It's fun; it's unusual; it's good."" 

One British bakery described it as the most exciting pastry launch since the sausage roll. 

But although they have proved extremely popular with British customers, the intense enthusiasm for cronuts in New York is unlikely to be replicated in London.

[Posted at 9:29 a.m. ET] 

Two months ago, a Texas district attorney vowed to put away the ""scum"" who had killed one of his top deputies. 

Now, the district attorney and his wife are dead. And authorities aren't sure whether their killings are part of a broader scheme targeting criminal justice officials. 

The bodies of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found Saturday in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. 

""I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm,"" Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said. ""As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney."" 

Fortner said police are taking ""extra precautions"" to try to ensure no one else is targeted. 

""We lost some important people, and we hope the killers are caught before any more people are lost,"" he said. 

A law enforcement official told The Dallas Morning News that a door was apparently kicked in, and ""there are shell casings everywhere."" 

Authorities have not identified a suspect. Nor are they sure whether the deaths are related to the killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. 

The county sheriff's office brought in the FBI and the Texas Rangers to help with the investigation.  Q: what was Mike McLelland position? A: District Attorney. Q: where did he live? A: Kaufman County. Q: in what state? A: Texas,. Q: what happened to him? A: he was found dead. Q: along with who? A: his wife. Q: what was her name? A: Cynthia. Q: Where were they found?

454,"As we drove along, my spirits went up again, and I turned, with pleasure, to the thought of the new life which I was entering. But though it was not far past the middle of September, the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to make the day extremely cold; and the journey seemed a very long one, so that it was nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination. Yet when we entered the gateway, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or two farther off. For the first time in my life I must stand alone: there was no retreating now. I must enter that house, and introduce myself among its strange people. But how was it to be done? True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was. Yet, anyway. I would do very well, after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease with them. 

""Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,"" I said within myself; and truly I was so fully occupied in steadying my nerves and keeping down the rebellious beat of my heart that when I was admitted into the hall and into the presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite greeting; and it afterwards struck me that the little I did say was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep. 

With due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me there to take a little refreshment for a little while and led me into the dining-room. Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I thought) and trying to keep something like a conversation-- consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks. In fact, my attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands. 

""I have had so little time to attend to their education myself, but I think they are clever children, and very willing to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock-- a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth."" ""His sister Mary Ann will require watching,"" continued she, ""but she is a very good girl on the whole, though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her bed to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to look after her washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she needs to have nothing further to do with the nursery maid."" 

I replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment the children entered the room. Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven. Mary was a tall girl, for her age of six, somewhat dark like her mother. The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl, looking little younger than Mary. The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two, whom I had more desire for than all the rest -- but with her I had nothing to do. Q: What time of year was it? A: not far past the middle of September. Q: how was the weather? A: extremely cold. Q: What time did they reach the destination? A: nearly one o'clock.

457,"(CNN) -- Radical Islamic websites Wednesday posted an Arab Spring audio message purportedly recorded by Osama bin Laden shortly before he was killed. 

The recording, which is more than 12 minutes long and was released by al Qaeda's media arm, As-Sahab, lists the speaker as bin Laden and calls him ""the martyr of Islam."" 

The audio begins with a prayer and remarks reportedly made by bin Laden about anti-government protests and uprisings earlier this year in several African and Middle East countries. 

CNN, which translated the audio, could not confirm its authenticity. 

The Islamic date with the audio indicates it was recorded between April 4 and May 3. 

Its posting came one day before U.S. President Barack Obama was to deliver a speech highlighting his administration's revised policies toward the Arab region in the wake of the Arab Spring protests.

The state capital is Bismarck, and the largest city is Fargo. 

North Dakota weathered the Great Recession of the early 21st century with a boom in natural resources, particularly a boom in oil extraction from the Bakken formation, which lies beneath the northwestern part of the state. The development drove strong job and population growth, and low unemployment. However, falling oil prices have put pressure on state finances, leading to questions about the lack of diversity in the North Dakota economy and its vulnerability to commodity price swings.

It was created on January 1, 1999, out of the former Lublin, Chełm, Zamość, Biała Podlaska and (partially) Tarnobrzeg and Siedlce Voivodeships, pursuant to Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998. The province is named after its largest city and regional capital, Lublin, and its territory is made of four historical lands: the western part of the voivodeship, with Lublin itself, belongs to Lesser Poland, the eastern part of Lublin Area belongs to Red Ruthenia, and the northeast belongs to Polesie and Podlasie. 

Lublin Voivodeship is bordered by Subcarpathian Voivodeship to the south, Świętokrzyskie Voivodeship to the south-west, Masovian Voivodeship to the west and north, Podlaskie Voivodeship along a short boundary to the north, and Belarus and Ukraine to the east. The province's population as of 2006 was 2,175,251. It covers an area of . 

The that encompasses Lublin, and approximates Lublin Voivodeship as it was before the Partitions of Poland, is known as ""Lubelszczyzna"". Provinces centred on Lublin have existed throughout much of Poland's history; for details see the section below on Previous Lublin Voivodeships. 

The region was, before World War II, one of the world's leading centres of Judaism. Before the middle of the 16th century, there were few Jews in the area, concentrated in Lublin, Kazimierz Dolny, and perhaps Chełm; but the founding of new private towns led to a large movement of Jews into the region to develop trade and services. Since these new towns competed with the existing towns for business, there followed a low-intensity, long-lasting feeling of resentment, with failed attempts to limit the Jewish immigration. The Jews tended to settle mostly in the cities and towns, with only individual families setting up businesses in the rural regions; this urban/rural division became another factor feeding resentment of the newly arrived economic competitors. By the middle of the 18th century, Jews were a significant part of the population in Kraśnik, Lubartów and Łęczna. Q: What is the location that is the focus of the article? A: Lublin Voivodeship.

""Buenos aires"" can be translated as ""fair winds"" or ""good airs"", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name ""Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre"". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. 

The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic. Q: What does buenos aires mean?

About five o'clock that afternoon Ephraim was sitting in his shirt-sleeves by the window of his room, and Cynthia was reading aloud to him an article (about the war, of course) from a Washington paper, which his friend, Mr. Beard, had sent him. There was a knock at the door, and Cynthia opened it to discover a colored hall-boy with a roll in his hand. 

""Mistah Ephum Prescott?"" he said. 

""Yes,"" answered Ephraim, ""that's me."" 

Cynthia shut the door and gave him the roll, but Ephraim took it as though he were afraid of its contents. 

""Guess it's some of them war records from Amasy,"" he said. 

""Oh, Cousin Eph,"" exclaimed Cynthia, excitedly, ""why don't you open it? If you don't I will."" 

""Guess you'd better, Cynthy,"" and he held it out to her with a trembling hand. 

Cynthia did open it, and drew out a large document with seals and printing and signatures.

1402,"Time was running out, and Mark Dickinson wasn't sure whether he'd get to see his dying 2-year-old grandson one last time. A long line at Los Angeles International Airport's security checkpoint had kept him from getting to his gate on time. 

His grandson Caden would be taken off life support in a matter of hours in Denver, Colorado, with or without his grandfather's presence, according to CNN affiliate KABC. 

""I was kind of panicking because I was running late, and I really thought I wasn't going to make the flight,"" Dickinson told KABC. 

That's when a pilot from Southwest Airlines stepped up and held the flight at the gate until Dickinson arrived. The pilot was standing by the air bridge waiting for him when Dickinson arrived in socks, so rushed that he just grabbed his shoes at security and ran through the terminal. 

""I told him, 'Thank you so much. I can't tell you how much I appreciated that.' And he said, 'No problem. They can't leave without me anyway,'""Dickinson told KABC. 

Authorities say Dickinson's grandson, Caden Rodgers, suffered a head injury after his mother's boyfriend threw him across the room. The boyfriend reportedly told police he was drunk and high on marijuana at the time. The child later died and the boyfriend has been charged with first-degree murder, according to the Aurora Sentinel. 

Thanks to the pilot, Dickinson made it to Colorado in time to say goodbye to his grandson. Most airlines would punish any staff member who holds up a flight, according to consumer advocate Christopher Elliott, who broke the story of the sympathetic pilot on his blog. However, a Southwest spokeswoman said the pilot's actions were praiseworthy. 

""You can't hold a plane for every late customer, but I think we would all agree that these were extenuating circumstances and the pilot absolutely made the right decision,"" Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said.

812,"A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. 

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. 

Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk. 

The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. 

Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants.""

Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries. It is a major symptom in many medical conditions, and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning.

""I don't think the doctor can go,"" sedately. ""He said something about having to make a country call this afternoon. But I'd love to."" 

""That's dandy! Who can we get?"" 

""Mrs. Dyer might be chaperon. She's been so nice. And maybe Dave, if he could get away from the store."" 

""How about Erik Valborg? I think he's got lots more style than these town boys. You like him all right, don't you?"" 

So the picnic of Carol, Fern, Erik, Cy Bogart, and the Dyers was not only moral but inevitable. 

They drove to the birch grove on the south shore of Lake Minniemashie. Dave Dyer was his most clownish self. He yelped, jigged, wore Carol's hat, dropped an ant down Fern's back, and when they went swimming (the women modestly changing in the car with the side curtains up, the men undressing behind the bushes, constantly repeating, ""Gee, hope we don't run into poison ivy""), Dave splashed water on them and dived to clutch his wife's ankle. He infected the others. Erik gave an imitation of the Greek dancers he had seen in vaudeville, and when they sat down to picnic supper spread on a lap-robe on the grass, Cy climbed a tree to throw acorns at them.

2566,"CHAPTER VI: A Game Of Hide And Seek 

There was a game of hide and seek that Danny Meadow Mouse once played with Buster Bear. It was a very dreadful game for Danny. But hard as it was for Danny, it didn't begin to be as hard as the game Lightfoot the Deer was playing with the hunter in the Green Forest. 

In the case of Buster Bear and Danny, the latter had simply to keep out of reach of Buster. As long as Buster didn't get his great paws on Danny, the latter was safe. Then, too, Danny is a very small person. He is so small that he can hide under two or three leaves. Wherever he is, he is pretty sure to find a hiding-place of some sort. His small size gives him advantages in a game of hide and seek. It certainly does. But Lightfoot the Deer is big. He is one of the largest of the people who live in the Green Forest. Being so big, it is not easy to hide. 

Moreover, a hunter with a terrible gun does not have to get close in order to kill. Lightfoot knew all this as he waited for the coming of the hunter of whom Sammy Jay had warned him. He had learned many lessons in the hunting season of the year before and he remembered every one of them. He knew that to forget even one of them might cost him his life. So, standing motionless behind a tangle of fallen trees, Lightfoot listened and watched.  Q: How many leaves does it take to conceal Danny? A: two or three. Q: What kind of animal was Danny? A: a Meadow Mouse. Q: What was his full name? A: Danny Meadow Mouse. Q: What was he playing? A: hide and seek. Q: With whom? A: Buster Bear. Q: lWas it easy for Danny? A: no.

""Questa montagna e tale, Che sempre al cominciar di sotto a grave. E quanto uom piu va su e men fa male."" --DANTE: _Il Purgatorio_. 

It was not many days after her mother's arrival that Gwendolen would consent to remain at Genoa. Her desire to get away from that gem of the sea, helped to rally her strength and courage. For what place, though it were the flowery vale of Enna, may not the inward sense turn into a circle of punishment where the flowers are no better than a crop of flame-tongues burning the soles of our feet? 

""I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,"" said Gwendolen, to her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child's feeling--even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to her late husband. 

Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she had ever done since her daughter's marriage. It seemed that her darling was brought back to her not merely with all the old affection, but with a conscious cherishing of her mother's nearness, such as we give to a possession that we have been on the brink of losing. 

""Are you there, mamma?"" cried Gwendolen, in the middle of the night (a bed had been made for her mother in the same room with hers), very much as she would have done in her early girlhood, if she had felt frightened in lying awake.

6793,"Futsal, (literally ""mini-football"", ""futebol de salão"" i.e. ""big room soccer""), is a variant of association football played on a hard court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It can be considered a version of five-a-side football. 

Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. 

""Futsal"" comes from Spanish ""fútbol sala or fútbol de salón"" and from Portuguese ""futebol de salão"". The term is commonly translated as ""indoor football"" but a more literal translation is ""hall/lounge football"". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name ""fútbol sala"" was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to ""futsal"". The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of ""fútbol"", FIFUSA has registered the word ""fut-sal"" in 1985 (Madrid, Spain). Since then FIFA has also started using the term futsal. The name has been translated into Italian as ""calcio a 5"" or ""football sala"", and French as ""football de salle"". Q: What languages does the word futsal come from? A: Spanish and Portuguese. Q: What is the translation in English? A: big room soccer. Q: What ground is it played on? A: a hard court surface. Q: Does it have the same number of players as regular football? A: unknown. Q: How many people are on a side? A: five. Q: With one playing what position? A: goalkeeper. Q: What is the French version of the word? A: ""football de salle"". Q: What was it called in 1985? A: ""fútbol sala"". Q: What happened to its name after that? A: changed to ""futsal"".

The House in Onslow Crescent 



Harry, as he walked away from the house in Bolton street, hardly knew whether he was on his heels or his head. Burton had told him not to dress--""We don't give dress dinner parties, you know. It's all in the family way with us""--and Harry, therefore, went direct from Bolton street to Onslow Crescent. But, though he managed to keep the proper course down Piccadilly, he was in such confusion of mind that he hardly knew whither he was going. It seemed as though a new form of life had been opened to him, and that it had been opened in such a way as almost necessarily to engulf him. It was not only that Lady Ongar's history was so terrible, and her life so strange, but that he himself was called upon to form a part of that history, and to join himself in some sort with that life. This countess, with her wealth, her rank, her beauty, and her bright intellect, had called him to her, and told him that he was her only friend. Of course he had promised his friendship. How could he have failed to give such a promise to one whom he had loved so well? But to what must such a promise lead, or rather to what must it not have led had it not been for Florence Burton? She was young, free, and rich. She made no pretence of regret for the husband she had lost, speaking of him as though in truth she hardly regarded herself as his wife. And she was the same Julia whom he had loved, who had loved him, who had jilted him, and in regret for whom he had once resolved to lead a wretched, lonely life!

The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more. One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.

SHEWING WHAT HUGH STANBURY THOUGHT ABOUT THE DUTY OF MAN. 

In the conference which took place between Sir Marmaduke and his wife after the interview between him and Nora, it was his idea that nothing further should be done at all. ""I don't suppose the man will come here if he be told not,"" said Sir Marmaduke, ""and if he does, Nora of course will not see him."" He then suggested that Nora would of course go back with them to the Mandarins, and that when once there she would not be able to see Stanbury any more. ""There must be no correspondence or anything of that sort, and so the thing will die away."" But Lady Rowley declared that this would not quite suffice. Mr. Stanbury had made his offer in due form, and must be held to be entitled to an answer. Sir Marmaduke, therefore, wrote the following letter to the ""penny-a-liner,"" mitigating the asperity of his language in compliance with his wife's counsels.

MY DEAR SIR,-- 

Lady Rowley has told me of your proposal to my daughter Nora; and she has told me also what she learned from you as to your circumstances in life. I need hardly point out to you that no father would be justified in giving his daughter to a gentleman upon so small an income, and upon an income so very insecure.

He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm.

7773,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Who's the greatest driver of all-time? Michael Schumacher? Maybe Alain Prost? Ayrton Senna perhaps? In an exclusive interview with CNN, three-time Formula One world champion, Jackie Stewart had no hesitation in naming his choice for the greatest driver of all-time. 

Three-time F1 champion, Jackie Stewart back in his heyday. 

""My hero, and the man I most respected and probably still do is Juan Manuel Fangio."" Stewart told CNN. 

It's not misty-eyed nostalgia for a bygone era that persuades ""The Flying Scot,"" as Stewart became known. And it wasn't just Fangio's tally of world titles that convinced Stewart; it is the manner in which the Argentine legend saw off his rivals. Who do you think is the greatest? 

""Fangio won five world championships almost in a different car every year. He had the dignity, the style and the ability,"" Stewart explained. 

What's more, as Stewart points out, Fangio didn't start racing in Formula One until he was 39-years-old, and whether driving a Ferrari, Lancia, Maserati or Mercedes, he kept on winning races. 

Though Fangio was the greatest, Stewart rated fellow countryman Jim Clark as the best driver he raced against. 

""His batting average was very good and he didn't race in too many grands prix."" Clark -- who was tragically killed racing at Hockenheim in 1968 -- won 25 of his 73 Formula One races. Stewart's record is comparable, winning 27 from 100 starts. 

It's this win to race ratio that really separates the good from the great Stewart believes.  Q: What did the man in this story do better than anyone else? A: the greatest driver of all-time. Q: How old was he when he won the Formula One? A: 39. Q: Did he use the same auto when he ran? A: no. Q: Who does he rate as the best? A: Juan Manuel Fangio. Q: How many times did Jackie Stewart take the cup? A: Three. Q: What makes the difference between good and great? A: win to race ratio. Q: How many did Stewart take? A: 27 from 100 starts.",Who died behind the wheel?,"['Jim Clark', 'Jim Clark', 'Clark', 'Clark']",30x31n5d63qt78kwzoawo2nep6sasl_7,1.0,0.0,Jim Clark.,True,,"You will be provided with a passage followed by a series of questions and answers based on the passage.

THE BATTLE IN THE PLAIN 

The distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of the chamber beneath it could not have been great, for all three of the victims of Tario's wrath alighted unscathed. 

Carthoris, still clasping Thuvia tightly to his breast, came to the ground catlike, upon his feet, breaking the shock for the girl. Scarce had his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready for instant use. But though the room was lighted, there was no sign of enemy about. 

Carthoris looked toward Jav. The man was pasty white with fear. 

""What is to be our fate?"" asked the Heliumite. ""Tell me, man! Shake off your terror long enough to tell me, so I may be prepared to sell my life and that of the Princess of Ptarth as dearly as possible."" 

""Komal!"" whispered Jav. ""We are to be devoured by Komal!"" 

""Your deity?"" asked Carthoris. 

The Lotharian nodded his head. Then he pointed toward a low doorway at one end of the chamber. 

""From thence will he come upon us. Lay aside your puny sword, fool. It will but enrage him the more and make our sufferings the worse."" 

Carthoris smiled, gripping his long-sword the more firmly. 

Presently Jav gave a horrified moan, at the same time pointing toward the door. 

""He has come,"" he whimpered. 

Carthoris and Thuvia looked in the direction the Lotharian had indicated, expecting to see some strange and fearful creature in human form; but to their astonishment they saw the broad head and great-maned shoulders of a huge banth, the largest that either ever had seen.  Q: Who fell from one floor to the one under it? A: all three of the victims. Q: Who was mad at them? A: Tario. Q: What or who was Carthoris holding? A: Thuvia. Q: Was that a girl? A: yes.

John Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, ""Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog."" 

Marley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. 

John Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions. He would show his anger and tiredness if he felt them. 

Even if that, Marley still had earned a place in the Grogans'. He didn't know how to dance, and he didn't know how to walk on its two legs, but he was what he was.

I said it might be interesting in terms of cultural anthropology, but don't expect to enjoy yourself. The social and legal restrictions on women are rampant. 

In the end she turned it down, and one big reason was her trepidation about how she would be treated. 

Western women work in the notoriously misogynistic Gulf States, mostly in PR for governments and doing business with multinationals. But the biggest contingent of foreign women working in those countries -- the millions of Bangladeshi, Indonesian and Filipino servants -- are off the radar. The events of this past week should be regarded as their, and the native women's, silent scream. 

Marte Deborah Dalelv, an interior designer working in Qatar, reported being raped last year while on a business trip to Dubai. Although her alleged attacker was arrested and jailed, so was she. A court sentenced her to 16 months in prison for having unlawful sex. 

World outrage at the Kafkaesque situation apparently provoked the Dubai potentate Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum to ""pardon"" Dalelv. She gets her passport back and is free to go home. She told reporters in Dubai she planned to get out soon.

4930,"(CNN) -- November 6, 2008, 9:06 a.m.: Ernie Casillas can peg the downward spiral of his life to that exact minute, when he was fired from his job as a mortgage broker. Barack Obama had just been elected president as Casillas was leaving the work force. 

Nearly four years later, as Obama seeks reelection, Casillas has finally landed his first full-time job, emerging out of the group known as the long-term unemployed. 

The Labor Department's July employment figures on Friday showed the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. The percentage of people who are unemployed long-term (27 weeks or longer) shrank from 41.9% in June to 40.7% in July. 

Casillas says his life is evidence that the economy is beginning to turn around. But the road to his new job was painful, heartbreaking and financially devastating. 

July jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises 

He remembers his life pre-November 2008: He wore expensive suits, drove a Mercedes and spent every cent of his paycheck. When he was laid off, he thought he'd be back at work in two weeks. 

He was wrong. 

The subprime mortgage crisis was eating away at the U.S. economy. Employers were shedding jobs, not adding them. A few credits shy of his associate degree, Casillas found himself overqualified for many jobs but underqualified for higher-paid middle-class ones. 

""Overqualified, what does that mean?"" Casillas remembers. ""They kept telling me that. Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain."" 

He lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother. A year after he lost his job, he began selling everything he owned on Craigslist.  Q: Who's the article about? A: Ernie Casillas. Q: When was he fired? A: November 6, 2008. Q: What was his profession? A: mortgage broker. Q: How much later did he get his next job? A: four years later,. Q: What were the reports posting about employment then? A: the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. Q: Who was seeking reelection around this time? A: Obama. Q: What ate away at the economy in the US?

Dan was his own man again in the morning, though rather pale and weak; he wanted to get up, but Cecily ordered him to stay in bed. Fortunately Felicity forgot to repeat the command, so Dan did stay in bed. Cecily carried his meals to him, and read a Henty book to him all her spare time. The Story Girl went up and told him wondrous tales; and Sara Ray brought him a pudding she had made herself.

In August it was a place of shady sweetness, fragrant with the odour of ripening apples, full of dear, delicate shadows. Through its openings we looked afar to the blue rims of the hills and over green, old, tranquil fields, lying the sunset glow. Overhead the lacing leaves made a green, murmurous roof. There was no such thing as hurry in the world, while we lingered there and talked of ""cabbages and kings."" A tale of the Story Girl's, wherein princes were thicker than blackberries, and queens as common as buttercups, led to our discussion of kings. We wondered what it would be like to be a king. Peter thought it would be fine, only kind of inconvenient, wearing a crown all the time.  Q: What did Sara Ray bring Dan? A: a pudding. Q: Were her intentions good? A: Yes. Q: How about the pudding?

6490,"(CNN) -- Evangelist Tony Alamo was arrested Thursday in Flagstaff, Arizona, on charges related to a child porn investigation, an FBI spokesman said. 

The 74-year-old founder and leader of Tony Alamo Christian Ministries was arrested without incident at 2:45 p.m. (4:45 p.m. ET) as he was departing the Little America Hotel with his wife, said Manuel Johnson, spokesman for the FBI in Phoenix, Arizona. 

The FBI, the Flagstaff Police Department and the Arizona Department of Public Safety were involved in the arrest, he said. 

Alamo was charged under a federal statute with having knowingly transported a minor across state lines with the intent to engage in sexual activity, Johnson said. 

Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Hoffman, was taken to Coconino County Jail in Flagstaff, where he is to have an initial appearance Friday in federal magistrate court, Johnson said. 

Over the weekend, about 100 federal and state agents authorities raided Alamo's 15-acre compound near Texarkana, Arkansas, and took six children into temporary custody. 

The children were interviewed as part of a two-year investigation into Tony Alamo Christian Ministries to determine whether they were physically or sexually abused, said Bill Sadler of the Arkansas State Police. 

Alamo, reached by phone Saturday in Los Angeles, California, denied any wrongdoing. 

""It's a hoax,"" Alamo said. ""They're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I'm a pornographer. Saying that I rape little children. ... I love children. I don't abuse them. Never have. Never will."" 

Asked why authorities were searching the property, Alamo compared himself to Christ.  Q: Who thinks he's Jesus? A: Alamo. Q: Does he admit to doing evil acts? A: no. Q: What is his real name?

1509,"Writing articles about films for The Front Page was my first proper job. Before then I had done bits of reviewing--novels for other newspapers, films for a magazine and anything I was asked to do for the radio. That was how I met Tom Seaton, the first arts editor of The Front Page, who had also written for television. He hired me, but Tom was not primarily a journalist, or he would certainly have been more careful in choosing his staff. 

At first, his idea was that a team of critics should take care of the art forms that didn't require specialized knowledge: books, TV, theatre, film and radio. There would be a weekly lunch at which we would make our choices from the artistic material that Tom had decided we should cover, though there would also be guests to make the atmosphere sociable. 

It all felt like a bit of dream at that time: a new newspaper and I was one of the team. It seemed so unlikely that a paper could be introduced into a crowded market. It seemed just as likely that a millionaire wanted to help me personally, and was pretending to employ me. Such was my lack of self-confidence. 

Tom's original scheme for a team of critics for the arts never took off. It was a good idea, but we didn't get together as planned and so everything was done by phone. It turned out, too, that the general public out there preferred to associate a reviewer with a single subject area, and so I chose film. Without Tom's initial push, though, we would hardly have come up with the present arrangement, by which I write an extended weekly piece, usually on one film. 

The space I am given allows me to broaden my argument--or forces me, in an uninteresting week, to make something out of nothing. But what is my role in the public arena? I assume that people choose what films to go to on the basis of the stars, the publicity or the director. So if a film review isn't really a consumer guide, what is it? I certainly don't feel I have a responsibility to be 'right' about a movie. Nor do I think there should be a certain number of 'great' and 'bad' films each year. All I have to do is put forward an argument. I'm not a judge, and nor would I want to be. Q: What was their first job? A: Writing articles about films for The Front Page. Q: Who did they meet?

The current archbishop is Justin Welby. His enthronement took place at Canterbury Cathedral on 21 March 2013. Welby is the 105th in a line which goes back more than 1400 years to Augustine of Canterbury, the ""Apostle to the English"", sent from Rome in the year 597. Welby succeeded Rowan Williams. 

From the time of St Augustine of Canterbury in the 6th century, until Archbishop Reginald Pole in the 16th century, the Archbishops of Canterbury were in full communion with the See of Rome and they usually received the pallium. During the English Reformation, based upon King Henry VIII's divorce from Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England broke away from the authority of the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. 

In the Middle Ages there was considerable variation in the methods of nomination of the Archbishop of Canterbury and other bishops. At various times the choice was made by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral, the Pope, or the King of England. Since the English Reformation, the Church of England has been more explicitly a state church and the choice is legally that of the Crown; today it is made by the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister, who receives a shortlist of two names from an ""ad hoc"" committee called the Crown Nominations Commission.

5153,"(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school. 

The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults. 

As shots rang out, Richie's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing. 

When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed. 

Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises. 

Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope 

But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy. 

""We think it's good he's going back,"" Wilford said. ""If I leave my child anywhere, I'm leaving a piece of my heart, so it's difficult to leave him."" 

'I think I'll be OK,' Sandy Hook student says after first day 

But Richie apparently isn't afraid and says he's looking forward to seeing his friends, she said. 

They won't be attending Sandy Hook Elementary, which police say remains part of an ongoing investigation into Adam Lanza, the gunman who also killed his mother before opening fire at the school.  Q: How old is Christine's son? A: 7-years-old. Q: What is his name? A: Richie. Q: Who is his mother? A: Christine Wilford. Q: What does she plan to resume doing with Richie?

134,"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The German news outlet Der Spiegel has published photographs of what appear to be two U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan posing over the bodies of dead Afghans -- images which threaten to further complicate the American military effort there. 

Two images show the soldiers kneeling by a bloody body sprawled over a patch of sand and grass. A third shows what appears to be two bodies propped up, back to back, against a post in front of a military vehicle. 

Der Spiegel identifies the soldiers as Spc. Jeremy Morlock and Pfc. Andrew Holmes, who are both facing charges relating to the wrongful deaths of Afghan civilians. 

Specifically, Holmes is charged with the premeditated deaths of three civilians, possessing a dismembered human finger, wrongfully possessing photographs of human casualties, and smoking hashish. 

He is also accused of conspiring with Morlock to shoot at a civilian and then toss a grenade so it would look like the soldiers were under attack. 

Morlock is charged with three counts of murder. He is accused of killing one Afghan civilian in January 2010 with a grenade and rifle; killing another in May 2010 in a similar manner; and shooting a third to death in February 2010. 

U.S. military rules also prohibit ""taking or retaining individual souvenirs or trophies,"" which the photographs may be construed as. 

The trial for the two soldiers is being conducted at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington. Morlock's court martial is slated to begin Wednesday, while the start date for Holmes' court martial has not been publicly announced.  Q: What news agency showed photos of American soldiers?

It all seemed endless. I was lonely. I hated the silence of the apartment. 

But one evening the silence was broken: I heard crying outside. I opened the door to find a little cat on the steps. He was thin and poor. He looked the way I felt. I brought him inside and gave him a can of fish. He ate it and then almost immediately fell sound asleep.

The afternoon at Clipstone was a success. Gillian was at home, and every one found congeners.

The county town was originally Wilton, after which the county is named, but Wiltshire Council is now based in the county town of Trowbridge. 

Wiltshire is characterised by its high downland and wide valleys. Salisbury Plain is noted for being the location of the Stonehenge and Avebury stone circles and other ancient landmarks, and as a training area for the British Army. The city of Salisbury is notable for its mediaeval cathedral. Important country houses open to the public include Longleat, near Warminster, and the National Trust's Stourhead, near Mere. 

The county, in the 9th century written as ""Wiltunscir"", later ""Wiltonshire"", is named after the former county town of Wilton. 

Wiltshire is notable for its pre-Roman archaeology. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and Bronze Age people that occupied southern Britain built settlements on the hills and downland that cover Wiltshire. Stonehenge and Avebury are perhaps the most famous Neolithic sites in the UK. 

In the 6th and 7th centuries Wiltshire was at the western edge of Saxon Britain, as Cranborne Chase and the Somerset Levels prevented the advance to the west. The Battle of Bedwyn was fought in 675 between Escuin, a West Saxon nobleman who had seized the throne of Queen Saxburga, and King Wulfhere of Mercia. In 878 the Danes invaded the county.

After that Neroy, a stay-at-home mom from Southern California, would file the e-mail in a folder for future reference. It wasn't exactly the most efficient system. 

Then last year, during one of her browsing sessions, she read a blog post that gushed about a new website called Pinterest. The virtual pinboard, where users can pin and organize images onto individual ""boards,"" didn't pique Neroy's interest at first, but she quickly changed her mind. 

""Someone described it as an online filing system, and I thought, 'That's exactly what I need,' "" she said.

The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. ""Buenos aires"" can be translated as ""fair winds"" or ""good airs"", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name ""Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre"". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million. 

The city of Buenos Aires is neither part of Buenos Aires Province nor the Province's capital; rather, it is an autonomous district. In 1880, after decades of political infighting, Buenos Aires was federalized and removed from Buenos Aires Province. The city limits were enlarged to include the towns of Belgrano and Flores; both are now neighborhoods of the city. The 1994 constitutional amendment granted the city autonomy, hence its formal name: Ciudad Autónoma de Buenos Aires (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires). Its citizens first elected a chief of government (i.e. mayor) in 1996; previously, the mayor was directly appointed by the President of the Republic. Q: What does buenos aires mean?

969,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy ""The Proposal"" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ... 

Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in ""The Proposal."" 

Something old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? 

Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. 

And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is ""X-Men's"" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) 

Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) 

OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. 

Something new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.

922,"(CNN) -- Before she was a princess, she was a child - shy but affectionate, respectful but mischievous. 

Diana Spencer, shown on her first birthday, grew up at Park House, a country estate leased from the royal family. 

Ten years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the ""People's Princess."" 

Diana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. 

Inge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. 

""There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,"" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. 

Life at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. 

When the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room. 

Despite growing up in the shadows of royalty, Crane and Mary Clarke, Diana's nanny starting at age 9, describe an ""ordinary"" childhood for Diana, a tomboy who loved going outdoors, climbing trees and playing with animals.

7941,"A440 or A4 (also known as the Stuttgart pitch), which has a frequency of 440 Hz, is the musical note of A above middle C and serves as a general tuning standard for musical pitch. 

The International Organization for Standardization classify it as ISO 16. Prior to the standardization on 440 Hz, other frequencies were standardised upon. Although not universally accepted, it serves as the audio frequency reference for the calibration of acoustic equipment and the tuning of pianos, violins, and other musical instruments. 

Prior to the standardization on 440 Hz, many countries and organizations followed the French standard since the 1860s of 435 Hz, which had also been the Austrian government's 1885 recommendation. Johann Heinrich Scheibler recommended A440 as a standard in 1834 after inventing the ""tonometer"" to measure pitch, and it was approved by the the same year. 

The American music industry reached an informal standard of 440 Hz in 1926, and some began using it in instrument manufacturing. In 1936 the American Standards Association recommended that the A above middle C be tuned to 440 Hz. This standard was taken up by the International Organization for Standardization in 1955 (reaffirmed by them in 1975) as ISO 16.

6589,"(CNN) -- The United States is deeply concerned about the well-being of Eman al-Obeidy, according to a State Department source, and worked closely with officials in Europe and Libya to get her safely out of the country. The same source said the U.S. is ""prepared to provide whatever help and support Eman may need."" 

Al-Obeidy grabbed the world's attention this spring when she accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's security forces of gang-raping her. 

She is now on the way to Malta with her father, according to another high-level U.S. State Department source. She will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination. 

She has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States. 

One of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout."" 

Al-Obeidy was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Libya. She was reportedly beaten before being deported. 

Najah Dawaji, a U.S.-based Libyan pro-freedom activist, said she was with three key members of Libya's Transitional National Council when they first learned that al-Obeidy was forced from Doha and arrived in Benghazi, Libya, on Thursday. She said al-Obeidy had a black eye, bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms. 

Al-Obeidy told a journalist that officials in the Transitional National Council had pressured the Qataris to expel her.

2789,"An atoll (, , , , or ), sometimes called a coral atoll, is a ring-shaped coral reef including a coral rim that encircles a lagoon partially or completely. There may be coral islands/cays on the rim. The coral of the atoll often sits atop the rim of an extinct seamount or volcano which has eroded or subsided partially beneath the water. The lagoon forms over the volcanic crater or caldera while the higher rim remains above water or at shallow depths that permit the coral to grow and form the reefs. For the atoll to persist, continued erosion or subsidence must be at a rate slow enough to permit reef growth upwards and outwards to replace the lost height. 

The word ""atoll"" comes from the Dhivehi (an Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Maldive Islands) word ""atholhu"" (Dhivehi: , ), meaning an administrative subdivision. Its first recorded use in English was in 1625 as ""atollon"" – Charles Darwin recognized its indigenous origin and coined, in his ""The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs"", the definition of atolls as ""circular groups of coral islets"" that is synonymous with ""lagoon-island"". 

More modern definitions of ""atoll"" describe them as ""annular reefs enclosing a lagoon in which there are no promontories other than reefs and islets composed of reef detritus"" or ""in an exclusively morphological sense, [as] a ring-shaped ribbon reef enclosing a lagoon"". Q: what kind of coral reef is discussed? A: a coral atoll. Q: what shape is it? A: a ring. Q: what is another attribute? A: it encircles a lagoon. Q: where is the coral? A: atop the rim. Q: of what?

[Posted at 9:29 a.m. ET] 

Two months ago, a Texas district attorney vowed to put away the ""scum"" who had killed one of his top deputies. 

Now, the district attorney and his wife are dead. And authorities aren't sure whether their killings are part of a broader scheme targeting criminal justice officials. 

The bodies of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found Saturday in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. 

""I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm,"" Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said. ""As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney."" 

Fortner said police are taking ""extra precautions"" to try to ensure no one else is targeted. 

""We lost some important people, and we hope the killers are caught before any more people are lost,"" he said. 

A law enforcement official told The Dallas Morning News that a door was apparently kicked in, and ""there are shell casings everywhere."" 

Authorities have not identified a suspect. Nor are they sure whether the deaths are related to the killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January.

4956,"Scott Alan woke up very early that morning in his bedroom in his house. He felt something licking his face and he wasn't sure what it was. As he opened his green eyes slowly, he saw a bit of fur. Then he saw a tongue. After that, some more fur and then slurp! He was licked again! 

""Oh, Boscoe!"" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together. The two of them really never left each other's side and Scott woke up many times this way. 

One of the most memorable adventures that Scott and Boscoe had happened when Scott was 12. Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. 

All of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, ""Boscoe!"" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river! 

As Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. 

""Boy, was that close!"" Scott yelled out loud! 

That was the best adventure ever! Q: Who awoke? A: Scott Alan. Q: what time of day? A: morning. Q: late? A: No. Q: where was he? A: in his bedroom. Q: what was touching him that made him awake?

6849,"(CNN)The family of a Jordanian fighter pilot mercilessly killed by ISIS is calling for total revenge. 

Lt. Moath al-Kasasbeh, 27, was burned alive while confined in a cage. 

In response, Jordan executed two prisoners -- Sajida al-Rishawi, a would-be suicide bomber whose release ISIS had previously demanded as part of a prisoner exchange, and Ziad Karbouli, a former top aide to the deceased leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. 

The pilot's father is demanding his country do more. 

""These were criminals and there is no comparison between them and Moath. His blood is more valued than Sajida al-Rishawi and Ziad Karbouli,"" said al-Kasasbeh's father, Safi. ""I demand that revenge should be bigger than executing prisoners."" 

His son's horrific death was recorded and the video was posted online Tuesday. 

CNN is not showing the images, which drew global condemnation and prompted protests and vows of retaliation in Jordan. 

King Abdullah has promised a strong response, saying that ISIS isn't just fighting his nation, but warring against ""noble Islam"" itself. 

The country now wants to step up airstrikes against the terrorist organization, according to a source with direct knowledge of the situation. 

But the pilot's uncle, Yassin Al Rawashdeh, told CNN that he also wants to see ground troops involved in the U.S.-led coalition against ISIS in Iraq and Syria. 

Said the pilot's father: ""I demand that this criminal organization (ISIS) ... should be annihilated.""

1659,"Weimar Republic was an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was ""Deutsches Reich""; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the ""Deutsches Reich"" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries – both left- and right-wing), as well as contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. Weimar Germany fulfilled most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles although it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. Q: What was an unofficial designation A: the Weimar Republic.

1722,"Spain and its autonomous communities are divided into fifty provinces (, ; sing. ""provincia""). Ceuta, Melilla and the Plazas de soberanía are not part of any provinces. 

The layout of Spain's provinces closely follows the pattern of the territorial division of the country carried out in 1833. The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub-division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one. 

Historically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history. The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections and as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes. 

A small town would normally be identified as being in, say, Valladolid province rather than the autonomous community of Castile and León. The provinces were the ""building-blocks"" from which the autonomous communities were created. Consequently, no province is divided between more than one of these communities. 

Most of the provinces—with the exception of Álava/Araba, Asturias/Asturies, Bizkaia/Vizcaya, Cantabria, Gipuzkoa/Gipúzcoa, Illes Balears/Islas Baleares, La Rioja, and Nafarroa/Navarra—are named after their principal town.

4135,"Sydney (CNN) -- Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, the two men vying to be Australia's prime minister in the September 7 national election, offer contrasting views on China, the country that looms largest on Australia's economic and strategic horizon. 

Rudd, the Chinese-speaking incumbent prime minister in the Labor-led government, says the China resources boom is over and Australia needs to prepare for that transition, given how important China has become as a trade partner in the past decade. 

China is a key destination for Australian resources such as iron ore, coal and LNG. But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. 

On the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific ""strategic road-map"" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region. 

READ MORE: Rudd: Better second time around? 

The Opposition's view on China 

Abbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of ""shared values."" 

But he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. 

In a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached ""the warmth that we take for granted with America."" Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. 

Like his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing. Howard, he said, ""understood that you could make a new friend without losing an old one.""  Q: Who has led the Liberal Party? A: Tony Abbott. Q: Who is he running against? A: Kevin Rudd. Q: What language does Rudd speak? A: Chinese. Q: Why is China important to Australia? A: China is a key destination for Australian resources. Q: What does Rudd want China and the United States to do? A: carve out a new Asia-Pacific ""strategic road-map"". Q: What is Abbott's view on the Australia-China relationship? A: to move from one based on shared interests to one of ""shared values."".

1708,"Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen. The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Bremen, Dresden, Hannover and Nuremberg. 

Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights. 

In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990. Q: When did Germany become a nation state? A: In 1871.

6894,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO ; ; '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance between several North American and European states based on the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949. 

NATO constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members (the United States, France and the United Kingdom) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states. NATO Headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium. 

NATO is an alliance that consists of 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. An additional 21 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to at least 2% of GDP. 

NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. Politically, the organization sought better relations with former Warsaw Pact countries, several of which joined the alliance in 1999 and 2004.

A SHOOTING TRIP TO PARADISE ISLE, AND FURTHER DISPLAY OF THE CAPTAIN'S CONTRIVANCES. 

While our explorers were thus reduced to a state of forced inaction as regarded the main object of their expedition, they did not by any means waste their time in idleness. On the contrary, each of the party went zealously to work in the way that was most suitable to his inclination. 

After going over the main island of Poloe as a united party, and ascertaining its size, productions, and general features, the Captain told them they might now do as they pleased. For his part he meant to spend a good deal of his time in taking notes and observations, questioning the chief men as to the lands lying to the northward, repairing and improving the hut, and helping the natives miscellaneously so as to gain their regard. 

Of course Leo spent much of his time with his rifle, for the natives were not such expert hunters but that occasionally they were badly off for food. Of course, also, Alf shouldered his botanical box and sallied forth hammer in hand, to ""break stones,"" as Butterface put it. Benjy sometimes followed Alf--more frequently Leo, and always carried his father's double-barrelled shot-gun. He preferred that, because his powers with the rifle were not yet developed. Sometimes he went with Toolooha, or Tekkona, or Oblooria, in one of the native oomiaks to fish. At other times he practised paddling in the native kayak, so that he might accompany Chingatok on his excursions to the neighbouring islands after seals and wild-fowl.  Q: Which chapter is this?

A MEETING. 

About a week after the dissolution of the Crooked Creek Company, Harry was riding over from Hetertown, and had nearly reached the creek on his way home, when he met George Purvis. 

This was their first meeting since their fight, for George had been away on a visit to some relatives in Richmond. 

When Harry saw George riding slowly toward him, he felt very much embarrassed, and very much annoyed because he was embarrassed. 

How should he meet George? What should he say; or should he say anything? 

He did not want to appear anxious to ""make up"" with him, nor did he want to seem as if he bore malice toward him. If he only knew how George felt about it! 

As it was, he wished he had stopped somewhere on the road. He had thought of stopping at the mill--why had he not? That would just have given George time to pass. 

Both boys appeared to be riding as slowly as their horses would consent to go, and yet when they met, Harry had not half made up his mind what he would say, or how he should say it, or whether it would be better or not to say anything. 

""Hello, George!"" said he, quite unpremeditatedly. 

""Hello!"" said George, reining in his horse ""Where are you going?"" 

""Going home,"" said Harry, also stopping in the road. 

Thus the quarrel came to an end.

But as she hurried down the subway stairs, she started to feel uncomfortably warm. By the time she got to the platform, Linda felt weak and tired -- maybe it hadn't been a good idea to give blood the night before, she thought. She rested herself against a post close to the tracks. 

Several yards away, Frank, 43, and his girlfriend, Jennifer, found a spot close to where the front of the train would stop. They were deep in discussion about a house they were thinking of buying. 

But when he heard the scream, followed by someone yelling, ""Oh, my God, she fell in!""Frank didn't hesitate. He jumped down to the tracks and ran some 40 feet toward the body lying on the rails. ""No ! Not you ! ""his girlfriend screamed after him. 

She was right to be alarmed. By the time Frank reached Linda, he could feel the tracks shaking and see the light coming. The train was about 20 seconds from the station. 

It was hard to lift her. She was just out. But he managed to raise her the four feet to the platform so that bystanders could hold her by the arms and drag her away from the edge. That was where Linda briefly regained consciousness, felt herself being pulled along the ground, and saw someone else holding her purse. 

Linda thought she'd been robbed. A woman held her hand and a man gave his shirt to help stop the blood pouring from her head. And she tried to talk but she couldn't, and that was when she realized how much pain she was in.

The lady told me her name was Helen and she called the restaurant she and her husband were going to have lunch at after her appointment to see if he was waiting for her there.She explained that she thought her husband parked the car in the parking lot and waited for her in the car but she didn't find him there so she returned to see if he entered the medical building,but Ed was not there either.She regretted making her husband park the car alone since some signs of Alzheimer's had happened in his behavior.I asked a few nurses to help look for Ed inside and outside the medical building according to Helen's description.Then I offered to drive Helen to the restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there.

[Posted at 9:29 a.m. ET] 

Two months ago, a Texas district attorney vowed to put away the ""scum"" who had killed one of his top deputies. 

Now, the district attorney and his wife are dead. And authorities aren't sure whether their killings are part of a broader scheme targeting criminal justice officials. 

The bodies of Mike McLelland and his wife, Cynthia, were found Saturday in their home in Kaufman County, east of Dallas. 

""I don't know of anyone who would want to cause him harm,"" Kaufman city Mayor William Fortner said. ""As far as I could tell, he was doing a really good job as a district attorney."" 

Fortner said police are taking ""extra precautions"" to try to ensure no one else is targeted. 

""We lost some important people, and we hope the killers are caught before any more people are lost,"" he said. 

A law enforcement official told The Dallas Morning News that a door was apparently kicked in, and ""there are shell casings everywhere."" 

Authorities have not identified a suspect. Nor are they sure whether the deaths are related to the killing of Kaufman County Assistant District Attorney Mark Hasse, who was killed on his way to work in January. 

The county sheriff's office brought in the FBI and the Texas Rangers to help with the investigation.  Q: what was Mike McLelland position? A: District Attorney. Q: where did he live?

3978,"George Zimmerman, set to stand trial in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, on Tuesday waived his right to a ""stand your ground"" pretrial immunity hearing. Zimmerman's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self-defense case. 

Florida's deadly force law, also called ""stand your ground"", was passed in 2005. It allows people to meet ""force with force"" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. 

In a pretrial immunity hearing, a judge would have ruled whether Zimmerman's actions were protected under the ""stand your ground"" law; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed. 

Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father's fiancée's house in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. 

Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17-year-old, but said Martin physically attacked him and he fired in self-defense. Initially, no charges were pursued, and the case soon became the center of a national controversy.

Another day made it certain that the garrison of Bristol had surrendered to the besiegers. A few shots were heard, but they were only fired in rejoicing by the Royalists, and while Steadfast was studying his barley field, already silvered over by its long beards, and wondering how soon it would be ripe, and how he should get it cut and stacked, his name was shouted out, and he saw Tom Oates and all the rest of the boys scampering down the lane. 

""Come along, Stead Kenton, come on and see, the Parliament soldiers come out and go by."" 

Poor Steadfast had not much heart for watching soldiers, but it struck him that he might see or hear something of Jephthah, so he came with the other boys to the bank, where from behind a hedge they could look down at the ranks of soldiers as they marched along, five abreast, the road was not wide enough to hold more. They had been allowed to keep their weapons, so the officers had their swords, and the men carried their musquets. Most of them looked dull and dispirited, and the officers had very gloomy, displeased faces. In fact, they were very angry with their commander, Colonel Fiennes, for having surrendered so easily, and he was afterwards brought to a court-martial for having done so. 

Stead did not understand this, he thought only of looking under each steel cap or tall, slouching hat for Jephthah.

5146,"(CNN) -- For the first time since the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, Christine Wilford plans do something remarkable on Thursday that once was routine: drop her child off at school. 

The last time her 7-year-old son, Richie, was in class was on December 14, when a gunman smashed his way into his school in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 26 children and adults. 

As shots rang out, Richie's teacher locked the door and huddled her students into the corner as the shooter roamed the hallways, wielding an AR-15 assault rifle and firing. 

When it appeared safe, the children were then hurried away to a nearby fire station, where teary parents either reunited with their sons and daughters or learned that they had been killed. 

Nearly a month later, Wilford said her son still has trouble sleeping and is often scared by loud noises. 

Newtown chooses faith, charity, hope 

But on Thursday, he will join hundreds of other Newtown students returning to class for the first time since the tragedy. 

""We think it's good he's going back,"" Wilford said. ""If I leave my child anywhere, I'm leaving a piece of my heart, so it's difficult to leave him."" 

'I think I'll be OK,' Sandy Hook student says after first day 

But Richie apparently isn't afraid and says he's looking forward to seeing his friends, she said.

A DINNER PARTY 

Phineas Duge in London was still a man of affairs. With a cigar in his mouth, and his hands behind his back, he was strolling about his handsomely furnished sitting-room at Claridge's, dictating to a secretary, while from an adjoining room came the faint click of a typewriter. Virginia entered somewhat unceremoniously, followed by Guy. Phineas Duge looked at them both in some surprise. 

""Uncle,"" she said, ""I met Guy coming away from Coniston Mansions. He was looking for me, and I have brought him to see you."" 

Phineas Duge held out his hand, and in obedience to a gesture, the secretary got up and left the room. 

""I am very glad to meet you, sir,"" he said. ""By the by, my niece has only mentioned your first name.""

This 15-year-old young man awoke to find that he had lost the use of his legs. However, he didn't give up. Many months later he began to compete in wheelchair sports. At the age of 27, he decided to wheel around the world to raise awareness and money for spinal cord research. His tour took him through 34 countries around the world between 1985 and 1987. In this Man of Motion World Tour, he wheeled 24,901.55 miles, which is equal to the distance around the earth. 

Bad weather and difficult, rocky roads often provided challenges for Rick, but he continued to push himself to complete the trip. He was determined to succeed. Even mountains did not stop Rick Hansen. He wheeled himself up the Rocky Mountains and several other major mountains in the world. He even wheeled himself along the Great Wall of China! 

""Never Give Up On Your Dreams"" was his motto and he hasn't given up yet. He completed his world tour raising $24 million. He continues to work to increase knowledge of spinal cord injury.

Ingleside, 1st November 1917 

""It is November--and the Glen is all grey and brown, except where the Lombardy poplars stand up here and there like great golden torches in the sombre landscape, although every other tree has shed its leaves. It has been very hard to keep our courage alight of late. The Caporetto disaster is a dreadful thing and not even Susan can extract much consolation out of the present state of affairs. The rest of us don't try. Gertrude keeps saying desperately, 'They must not get Venice--they must not get Venice,' as if by saying it often enough she can prevent them. But what is to prevent them from getting Venice I cannot see. Yet, as Susan fails not to point out, there was seemingly nothing to prevent them from getting to Paris in 1914, yet they did not get it, and she affirms they shall not get Venice either. Oh, how I hope and pray they will not--Venice the beautiful Queen of the Adriatic. Although I've never seen it I feel about it just as Byron did--I've always loved it--it has always been to me 'a fairy city of the heart.' Perhaps I caught my love of it from Walter, who worshipped it. It was always one of his dreams to see Venice. I remember we planned once--down in Rainbow Valley one evening just before the war broke out--that some time we would go together to see it and float in a gondola through its moonlit streets.

THROUGH the balance of the day and all during the long night Billy Byrne swung along his lonely way, retracing the familiar steps of the journey that had brought Barbara Harding and himself to the little island in the turbulent river. 

Just before dawn he came to the edge of the clearing behind the dwelling of the late Oda Yorimoto. Somewhere within the silent village he was sure that the two prisoners lay. 

During the long march he had thrashed over again and again all that the success of his rash venture would mean to him. Of all those who might conceivably stand between him and the woman he loved--the woman who had just acknowledged that she loved him--these two men were the most to be feared. 

Billy Byrne did not for a moment believe that Anthony Harding would look with favor upon the Grand Avenue mucker as a prospective son-in-law. And then there was Mallory! He was sure that Barbara had loved this man, and now should he be restored to her as from the grave there seemed little doubt but that the old love would be aroused in the girl's breast. The truth of the matter was that Billy Byrne could not conceive the truth of the testimony of his own ears--even now he scarce dared believe that the wonderful Miss Harding loved him--him, the despised mucker!

4126,"Sydney (CNN) -- Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, the two men vying to be Australia's prime minister in the September 7 national election, offer contrasting views on China, the country that looms largest on Australia's economic and strategic horizon. 

Rudd, the Chinese-speaking incumbent prime minister in the Labor-led government, says the China resources boom is over and Australia needs to prepare for that transition, given how important China has become as a trade partner in the past decade. 

China is a key destination for Australian resources such as iron ore, coal and LNG. But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. 

On the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific ""strategic road-map"" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region. 

READ MORE: Rudd: Better second time around? 

The Opposition's view on China 

Abbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of ""shared values."" 

But he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. 

In a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached ""the warmth that we take for granted with America."" Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. 

Like his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing. Howard, he said, ""understood that you could make a new friend without losing an old one.""  Q: Who has led the Liberal Party? A: Tony Abbott. Q: Who is he running against? A: Kevin Rudd. Q: What language does Rudd speak? A: Chinese. Q: Why is China important to Australia? A: China is a key destination for Australian resources. Q: What does Rudd want China and the United States to do? A: carve out a new Asia-Pacific ""strategic road-map"". Q: What is Abbott's view on the Australia-China relationship? A: to move from one based on shared interests to one of ""shared values."".

5467,"London (CNN) -- Janet Jackson is opening up for the first time about a duet with her brother that she's reviving two years after his death. 

Jackson took to the stage in London on Thursday and performed their 1995 song Scream as video of Michael Jackson played and his voice filled Royal Albert Hall. 

The reworked duet follows in the footsteps of jazz pianist and singer Nat King Cole and his daughter, Natalie Cole. In 1991 she turned her father's famous 1961 recording ""Unforgettable"" into a father-daughter duet. 

Janet Jackson said she did the original duet at the request of her brother years ago. 

""I was on the Rhythm Nation tour and Mike actually asked me to do a song with him and I told him no. I didn't want to do it. I felt I hadn't come into my own and I hadn't fully made a name for myself ... and I didn't want to ride anyone's coattails,"" she said. ""And I remember being in the Janet Tour a few good years later and he asked me again if I would do a song with him. And I felt, at that point, I'd carved my own little niche in this world of music and I felt okay, I can do this now and that's how it came about."" 

Jackson said that performing the song alongside her brother again isn't difficult. 

""It feels great -- just listening to and hearing his voice,"" she said, adding that on stage she finds herself, ""remembering the experience of recording it.""  Q: Who is doing a show in London?

Benedict's election occurred in the 2005 papal conclave that followed the death of Pope John Paul II. Since his resignation, Benedict holds the title Pope Emeritus. 

Ordained as a priest in 1951 in his native Bavaria, Ratzinger established himself as a highly regarded university theologian by the late 1950s and was appointed a full professor in 1958. After a long career as an academic and professor of theology at several German universities, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising and Cardinal by Pope Paul VI in 1977, an unusual promotion for someone with little pastoral experience. In 1981, he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, one of the most important dicasteries of the Roman Curia. From 2002 until his election as Pope, he was also Dean of the College of Cardinals.

7345,"Israel was happy, very happy. The news of a deal to bring home the kidnapped soldier Gilad Shalit , a young man held prisoner by Hamas for five years,spread. But the happiness was hardened by the reality of the price Israelis had paid to set him free. The 1,027 Palestinian prisoners to be exchanged for the single Israeli corporal turned out to include men and women convicted of some of the worst terrorist attacks in the country. ""Ambivalent,"" says Aya Ilouz, of her feelings on the matter. Strolling in downtown Jerusalem with her husband Liron and their 5-month-old daughter Yael, the couple is so in sync on the question of the day that they finish each other's thoughts. ""Yes,"" says Liron, ""we are very happy and excited to see Gilad meet his family. And on the other hand--"" ""We are very concerned,"" says Aya. ""About what happens next,"" Liron explains. ""When the next terrorist blows himself up, someone will have to answer."" Just around the corner, on King George Street, Alan Bauer had been walking home with his son on March 21, 2002, when a Palestinian man named Mohammad Hashaika exploded a suicide vest packed with metal scraps. Eighty-four people were wounded that day. Of the three killed, one was a woman pregnant with twins. Though the bomber of course died, Israeli courts convicted the two women who drove him to the site of the bombing, easing his way past the Israeli checkpoint by buying flowers to carry in the Mother's Day crowd. ""These women, as I speak, are being released,"" Bauer says. Specifics have a way of weakening the joy of Shalit's release. Among the 477 prisoners released on Tuesday, in the first phase of the exchange, are an organizer of the 2002 Passover bombing that killed 30 people; a woman who developed an online relationship with a lovesick Israeli youth she then had murdered when he came to meet her; and the man who proudly displayed his bloody hands to the mob gathered outside the Ramallah building where two Israeli soldiers were beaten to death after making a wrong turn on Oct. 12, 2000. When the list became public, s of terrorism victims appealed, without success, to Israel's supreme court to prevent the prisoner exchange. The court hearing was interrupted repeatedly by upset survivors, including Shvuel Schijveschuurder, who lost five of his family members in a 2001 attack at a Jerusalem Sbarro. To protest the release of the woman who drove the suicide bomber to the pizza restaurant, Schijveschuurder poured paint on a memorial to Yitzhak Rabin, the Prime Minister slain by an Israeli extremist for signing the Oslo Accords. ""When we say 1,027 prisoners will be released, it's abstract, it doesn't mean anything,"" says Eliad Moreh Rosenberg, who was wounded in the 2002 terrorism bombing at the Hebrew University cafeteria. ""But for victims of terror, it's a reality."" Israeli officials calculate that 60% of those released resume terrorism attacks. To help prevent that resumption this time around, Israel insisted that most of the prisoners liberated be sent either to the Gaza Strip -- which is sealed off from Israel and under the control of Hamas, which says it continues to observe a cease-fire -- or into exile in Turkey, Qatar or Syria. About 100 arrived in the West Bank, where the government led by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas works diligently to suppress terrorism, cooperating with Israeli intelligence and military. With the future uncertain, on Tuesday, Jewish Israelis stopped and stared at televisions wherever they came upon them. On the sidewalk at midmorning outside the 24-hour Hillel Market, 50 people were gathered under a flat screen to catch the first images of Shalit, looking painfully thin . ""It was moving. It was very exciting,"" says Anat Rubin, 42. ""I just saw photos of him getting out of the car. It gave me chills."" But she says she heard Hamas say that, learning from success, it was keen to kidnap more Israelis in order to win freedom for the 6,000 Palestinians still in Israeli prisons. ""I don't want to see the photos of them doing the V for victory,"" she says. ""Like they won. They are really releasing murderers. I'm happy and sad all together."" Q: Who was kidnapped?

4153,"(CNN) -- Manchester City thrashed Sunderland 5-0 to keep alive their slim English Premier League title hopes and to cement their position in the top four Champions League places. 

England international Adam Johnson, making his first start since injuring his ankle in January, opened the scoring in the ninth minute while captain Carlos Tevez doubled the Blues' advantage on the quarter hour from the penalty spot. 

Second-half strikes from David Silva, Patrick Vieira and Yaya Toure completed the rout as City went above reigning champions Chelsea into third in the standings. 

They are six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, who pipped them for the final Champions League place last season, but have played a game more. 

Leaders Manchester United have a seven-point lead over Arsenal, who have played a game less, with their neighbors City 10 points adrift. 

The strikes from Johnson, who exchanged passes with Toure before finishing neatly, and Tevez, who was fouled by Michael Turner to draw the penalty, effectively ended the match as a contest with City always in command against a Sunderland side in poor recent form. 

Silva scored after a Mario Balotelli shot was blocked, Vieira with his first touch after coming off the bench and Toure after an error by Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole. 

City's Dutch international Nigel de Jong said the result was important for their Champions League ambitions. 

""There are still seven games to go and anything can happen but this is a great confidence boost for our team -- we are real contenders for the Champions League places."" he told Sky Sports.

Pielage said he was impressed by the perseverance of firefighters and those who live in the community. 

""The photos document both the relentless work the firefighters did to save the homes of Greer as well as, tragically, the ones they could not,"" he said.

49,"(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as ""Law & Order,"" ""Crime Story,"" and ""Miami Vice,"" has died. He was 69. 

""We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,"" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. ""Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues."" 

Farina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, ""Thief."" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as ""Miami Vice"" (in which Farina played a mobster) and ""Crime Story"" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). 

Farina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including ""Midnight Run"" (1988), ""Get Shorty"" (1995), ""The Mod Squad"" (1999) and ""Snatch"" (2000). 

In 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running ""Law & Order"" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff ""Trial by Jury."" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe.

4078,"The Christian Science Monitor (CSM) is an international news organization that delivers global coverage via its website, weekly magazine, daily news briefing, email newsletters, Amazon Kindle subscription, and mobile site. It was started in 1908 by Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist. , the print circulation was 75,052. 

The ""Monitor"" is a newspaper that covers international and United States current events. The paper includes a daily religious feature on ""The Home Forum"" page, but states the publication is not a platform for evangelizing. 

In 2008 the ""Monitor"" discontinued its daily print version to focus on web-based publishing, replacing its daily print edition with a weekly news magazine with an international focus. Mark Sappenfield became the editor in March of 2017. 

Despite its name, the ""Monitor"" does not claim to be a religious-themed paper, and says it does not promote the doctrine of its patron church. However, at its founder Eddy's request, a daily religious article has appeared in every issue of the ""Monitor"". Eddy also required the inclusion of ""Christian Science"" in the paper's name, over initial opposition by some of her advisors who thought the religious reference might repel a secular audience. 

The ""Monitor""'s inception was, in part, a response by Eddy to the journalism of her day, which relentlessly covered the sensations and scandals surrounding her new religion with varying degrees of accuracy. In addition, Joseph Pulitzer's ""New York World"" was consistently critical of Eddy, and this, along with a derogatory article in ""McClure's"", furthered Eddy's decision to found her own media outlet.

4687,"(CNN) -- Shiping Bao, the medical examiner who changed his mind on crucial aspects during his testimony at George Zimmerman's trial, has been fired. 

But he's not going down without a fight. 

Bao has hired a lawyer and is hinting at a lawsuit. 

Bao was let go from his job as the associate medical examiner for the Volusia County, Florida, Medical Examiner's Office last week, officials said Wednesday. 

Authorities provided a copy of his termination letter, but did not specify a reason. The letter says Bao was given a choice to resign. He didn't. So, he was terminated Friday. 

Bao's lawyer filed a complaint against the county, CNN affiliate Central Florida News 13 reported. 

The letter reads in part: 

""This is a formal request to ask you to preserve any and all documents...and/or evidence related to Dr. Bao's claims and/or the Trayvon Martin Case."" 

Bao performed Trayvon Martin's autopsy after Zimmerman shot dead the 17-year-old on February 26, 2012. 

During Zimmerman's trial, Bao's testimony stood out. 

He changed his mind on important aspects of the case, such as how long Martin survived after he was shot, whether he could have moved afterward and if the marijuana in his system affected his judgment. 

Bao's attorney, Willie E. Gary, said he plans to file a lawsuit for discrimination, job harassment and wrongful termination, the Miami Herald reported.

Catholic regions are the Eichsfeld in the northwest and parts of the Rhön Mountains around Geisa in the southwest. Protestant church membership is shrinking rapidly, whereas the Catholic Church is somewhat more stable because of Catholic migration from Poland, Southern Europe and West Germany.

As Bill Shankly, the legendary former manager of English club Liverpool, pointed out shortly before he passed away in 1981, the significance of the beautiful game can never be underestimated -- and that doesn't just apply to fans of the sport, either. 

Soccer can affect lives on a national and international scale, inspiring revolutions and causing wars as well as having the capability to create peace and lift entire nations. 

The ""Football War"" between Honduras and El Salvador in 1969 is perhaps the most famous example of the sport's wider implications. The two Central American nations famously came to blows following their qualification match for the 1970 World Cup.

""The Laughing Brook is merry And so am I,"" cried Jerry. Grandfather Frog said he was too. And Spotty was, the others knew. 

The trees stood with wet feet where just a little while before had been the strange pond in the Green Forest, the pond made by the dam of Paddy the Beaver. In the dam was a great hole made by Paddy himself. 

Through the Green Forest rang the laughter of the Laughing Brook, for once more the water ran deep between its banks. And in the hearts of Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Spotty the Turtle was laughter also, for now the Smiling Pool would smile once more, and they could go home in peace and happiness. And there was one more who laughed. Who was it? Why, Paddy the Beaver to be sure, and his was the best laugh of all, for it was because he had brought happiness to others. 

""You beat me up here to the dam, but you won't beat me back to the Smiling Pool,"" cried Jerry Muskrat to Spotty the Turtle. 

Spotty laughed good-naturedly. ""You'd better not stop to eat or play or sleep on the way then,"" said he, ""for I shall keep right on going all the time. I've found that is the only way to get anywhere."" 

""Let us all go down together"" said Grandfather Frog. ""We can help each other over the bad places."" 

Jerry Muskrat laughed until he had to hold his sides at the very thought of Grandfather Frog or Spotty the Turtle being able to help him, but he is very good-natured, and so he agreed that they should all go down together.

7790,"A psychological identity relates to self-image (one's mental model of oneself), self-esteem, and individuality. Consequently, Weinreich gives the definition ""A person's identity is defined as the totality of one's self-construal, in which how one construes oneself in the present expresses the continuity between how one construes oneself as one was in the past and how one construes oneself as one aspires to be in the future""; this allows for definitions of aspects of identity, such as: ""One's ethnic identity is defined as that part of the totality of one's self-construal made up of those dimensions that express the continuity between one's construal of past ancestry and one's future aspirations in relation to ethnicity"" (Weinreich, 1986a). 

The description or representation of individual and group identity is a central task for psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists and those of other disciplines where ""identity"" needs to be mapped and defined. How should one describe the identity of another, in ways which encompass both their idiosyncratic qualities and their group memberships or identifications, both of which can shift according to circumstance? Following on from the work of Kelly, Erikson, Tajfel and others Weinreich's Identity Structure Analysis (ISA), is ""a structural representation of the individual's existential experience, in which the relationships between self and other agents are organised in relatively stable structures over time … with the emphasis on the socio-cultural milieu in which self relates to other agents and institutions"" (Weinreich and Saunderson, (eds) 2003, p1). Using constructs drawn from the salient discourses of the individual, the group and cultural norms, the practical operationalisation of ISA provides a methodology that maps how these are used by the individual, applied across time and milieus by the ""situated self"" to appraise self and other agents and institutions (for example, resulting in the individual's evaluation of self and significant others and institutions).[citation needed] Q: What is the ISA?

6787,"Futsal, (literally ""mini-football"", ""futebol de salão"" i.e. ""big room soccer""), is a variant of association football played on a hard court, smaller than a football pitch, and mainly indoors. It can be considered a version of five-a-side football. 

Futsal is played between two teams of five players each, one of whom is the goalkeeper. Unlimited substitutions are permitted. Unlike some other forms of indoor football, the game is played on a hard court surface delimited by lines; walls or boards are not used. Futsal is also played with a smaller ball. The surface, ball, and rules create an emphasis on improvisation, creativity, and technique as well as ball control and passing in small spaces. 

""Futsal"" comes from Spanish ""fútbol sala or fútbol de salón"" and from Portuguese ""futebol de salão"". The term is commonly translated as ""indoor football"" but a more literal translation is ""hall/lounge football"". During the sport's second world championships held in Madrid in 1985, the Spanish name ""fútbol sala"" was used. Since then, all other names have been officially and internationally changed to ""futsal"". The naming was due to a dispute between FIFUSA (the predecessor to the AMF) and FIFA over the name of ""fútbol"", FIFUSA has registered the word ""fut-sal"" in 1985 (Madrid, Spain). Since then FIFA has also started using the term futsal. The name has been translated into Italian as ""calcio a 5"" or ""football sala"", and French as ""football de salle"". Q: What languages does the word futsal come from? A: Spanish and Portuguese. Q: What is the translation in English? A: big room soccer. Q: What ground is it played on? A: a hard court surface.

THE BATTLE IN THE PLAIN 

The distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of the chamber beneath it could not have been great, for all three of the victims of Tario's wrath alighted unscathed. 

Carthoris, still clasping Thuvia tightly to his breast, came to the ground catlike, upon his feet, breaking the shock for the girl. Scarce had his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready for instant use. But though the room was lighted, there was no sign of enemy about. 

Carthoris looked toward Jav. The man was pasty white with fear. 

""What is to be our fate?"" asked the Heliumite. ""Tell me, man! Shake off your terror long enough to tell me, so I may be prepared to sell my life and that of the Princess of Ptarth as dearly as possible."" 

""Komal!"" whispered Jav. ""We are to be devoured by Komal!"" 

""Your deity?"" asked Carthoris. 

The Lotharian nodded his head. Then he pointed toward a low doorway at one end of the chamber. 

""From thence will he come upon us. Lay aside your puny sword, fool. It will but enrage him the more and make our sufferings the worse."" 

Carthoris smiled, gripping his long-sword the more firmly. 

Presently Jav gave a horrified moan, at the same time pointing toward the door. 

""He has come,"" he whimpered. 

Carthoris and Thuvia looked in the direction the Lotharian had indicated, expecting to see some strange and fearful creature in human form; but to their astonishment they saw the broad head and great-maned shoulders of a huge banth, the largest that either ever had seen.

But that hasn't kept him from becoming embroiled, even if unintentionally, in U.S.-North Korea relations. 

His apparent chumminess with North Korea's leader has been controversial, as have previous proclamations that Kim Jong Un is a ""nice guy."" 

Rodman said he simply does not know enough about the allegations of abuse and authoritarianism that Kim is reviled for. 

""I keep telling people, I'm not there to be an ambassador to try to figure out why (is Kim) doing all these things? That's not my job,"" Rodman told CNN's Chris Cuomo on ""New Day"" Friday. 

It was his first interview since entering an alcohol rehabilitation facility two weeks ago. 

The former basketball player is probably the American with the most access to the North Korean leader, and many have been critical that he has not lobbied for the release of American prisoner Kenneth Bae from a labor camp. 

""I'm not an ambassador, and I tried to strive and tell people, just because I know the marshal (Kim), that doesn't mean I know the marshal like that,"" he said. 

Rodman says he didn't mean to insinuate during an earlier interview this month that he knew why Bae, a Korean-American, was being held in North Korea. 

""To this day I still don't know what he did,"" Rodman said, even offering to take Bae's place if he could. 

""I feel for (Bae's family). I feel for them deeply. ... I would do anything literally. This is Dennis Rodman talking.

On the next day but one, Randal arranged his departure for Sydenham, so as to arrive at the hotel an hour before the time appointed for the dinner. His prospects of success, in pleading for a favorable reception of his brother's message, were so uncertain that he refrained--in fear of raising hopes which he might not be able to justify--from taking Herbert into his confidence. No one knew on what errand he was bent, when he left the house. As he took his place in the carriage, the newspaper boy appeared at the window as usual. The new number of a popular weekly journal had that day been published. Randal bought it. 

After reading one or two of the political articles, he arrived at the columns specially devoted to ""Fashionable Intelligence."" Caring nothing for that sort of news, he was turning over the pages in search of the literary and dramatic articles, when a name not unfamiliar to him caught his eye. He read the paragraph in which it appeared. 

""The charming widow, Mrs. Norman, is, we hear, among the distinguished guests staying at Buck's Hotel. It is whispered that the lady is to be shortly united to a retired naval officer of Arctic fame; now better known, perhaps, as one of our leading philanthropists."" 

The allusion to Bennydeck was too plain to be mistaken. Randal looked again at the first words in the paragraph. ""The charming widow!"" Was it possible that this last word referred to Catherine? To suppose her capable of assuming to be a widow, and--if the child asked questions--of telling Kitty that her father was dead, was, in Randal's estimation, to wrong her cruelly.

""We are so happy to share with you exciting news that has happened over the last few months...Jeff and Erin became engaged and are expecting their first child in the summer!!! Congratulations Jeff and Erin!!"" 

The posting did not reveal a due date for the child or a wedding date. 

Bauman is credited with helping investigators identify the suspects in the April 15, 2013, double bombing. 

The image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. 

A day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. 

Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. 

Bauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled ""Stronger"" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. 

""The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals,"" he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.

The Fenian adventure furnished the distraction which Lothair required It broke that absorbing spell of sentiment which is the delicious but enervating privilege of the youthful heart; yet, when Lothair woke in the morning from his well-earned slumbers, the charm returned, and he fell at once into a reverie of Belmont, and a speculation when he might really pay his first visit there. Not to-day--that was clearly out of the question. They had separated only yesterday, and yet it seemed an age, and the adventure of another world. There are moods of feeling which defy alike time and space. 

But on the morrow, Friday, he might venture to go. But, then, would to-morrow ever come? It seemed impossible. How were the intervening hours to pass? The world, however, was not so devoid of resources as himself, and had already appropriated his whole day. And, first, Monsignore Catesby came to breakfast with him, talking of every thing that was agreeable or interesting, but in reality bent on securing his presence at the impending ecclesiastical ceremony of high import, where his guardian was to officiate, and where the foundation was to be laid of the reconciliation of all churches in the bosom of the true one. Then, in the afternoon, Lothair had been long engaged to a match of pigeon-shooting, in which pastime Bertram excelled. It seemed there was to be a most exciting sweepstakes to-day, in which the flower of England were to compete; Lothair among them, and for the first time.  Q: How long had they been apart?

5419,"The Board Meeting had come to an end. Bob started to stand up and knocked into the table, spilling his coffee over his notes. ""How embarrassing! I am getting so clumsy in my old age."" 

Everyone had a good laugh, and soon we were all telling stories of our most embarrassing moments. It came around to Frank, who sat quietly listening to the others. Someone said, ""Come on, Frank. Tell us your most embarrassing moment."" 

Frank laughed and began to tell us of his childhood. ""I grew up in San Pedro. My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home."" 

He looked at us and said, ""I wish you could have met my Dad. He was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas, foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. His rain hat would be pulled down over his brow. No matter how much my mother washed them, they would still smell of the sea and of fish."" 

Frank's voice dropped a bit. ""When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He had this old truck that he used in his fishing business. That truck was older than he was. It would wheeze and rattle down the road. You could hear it coming for blocks. As he would drive toward the school, I would shrink down into the seat hoping to disappear. Half the time, he would slam to a stop and the old truck would belch a cloud of smoke. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here, I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me goodbye!"" 

He paused and then went on, ""I remember the day I decided I was too old for a goodbye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but I put my hand up and said, ""No, Dad."" It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face. I said, ""Dad, I'm too old for a goodbye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss."" My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. Then he turned and looked out of the windshield . ""You're right,"" he said. "" You are a big boy....a man. I won't kiss you anymore."" 

Frank got a funny look on his face, and the tears began to well up in his eyes, as he spoke. ""It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back. It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Dad. He had a big family to feed. They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out. He must have gotten into a strong wind and was trying to save the nets and the floats."" 

I looked at Frank and saw that tears were running down his cheeks. Frank spoke again. ""Guys, you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek...to feel his rough old face... to smell the ocean on him... to feel his arm around my neck. _ . If I had been a man, I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a goodbye kiss."" Q: Why is Frank crying? A: Dad went to sea and never came back. Q: Where did he grow up?

7599,"(CNN) -- His was a suicide with a macabre twist. In February, former Chicago Bears safety David Duerson shot himself in the chest, but not before leaving behind a note requesting his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players. 

The plaintive note read, ""Please, see that my brain is given to the NFL's brain bank."" 

Today, scientists announced that Duerson's brain tissue showed ""moderately advanced"" evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a dementia-like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma. 

""Dave Duerson had classic pathology of CTE and no evidence of any other disease,"" said Dr. Ann McKee, a neuropathologist with the Bedford VA Medical Center, and co-director of the Boston University School of Medicine Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy. ""He had severe involvement of areas that control judgment, inhibition, impulse control, mood and memory."" 

CTE has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former NFL players thus far studied at the center. Their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions, sub-concussive blows to the head, or both. The picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that trauma could be causing brain damage. 

A brain with CTE is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau. Under a microscope, tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia. Except the cases of CTE have shown this progressive, dementia-like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis, which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s. 

Mike Webster, an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers whose CTE was also diagnosed posthumously, was 50 when he died. John Grimsley, a nine-year NFL veteran who played most of his career with the Houston Oilers, was 45, and Duerson was 50. Scientists at Boston University have found evidence of CTE in the brain of an athlete as young as 18.  Q: What did David want done with his brain? A: given to the NFL's brain bank. Q: what parts of his brains were discovered to be affected? A: brain tissue. Q: what disease did this show he had? A: chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Q: any other diseases?

5379,"(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. 

The photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. 

Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. 

Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, ""Ernst Haas: On Set."" 

""Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,"" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. 

And the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work.

3783,"Louisiana is a state located in the Southern United States. Louisiana is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States. Its capital is Baton Rouge and largest city is New Orleans. Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are the local government's equivalent to counties. The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish, and the largest by total area is Plaquemines. Louisiana is bordered by Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, Texas to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. 

Much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also many species of tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four that have not yet received recognition.

4934,"(CNN) -- November 6, 2008, 9:06 a.m.: Ernie Casillas can peg the downward spiral of his life to that exact minute, when he was fired from his job as a mortgage broker. Barack Obama had just been elected president as Casillas was leaving the work force. 

Nearly four years later, as Obama seeks reelection, Casillas has finally landed his first full-time job, emerging out of the group known as the long-term unemployed. 

The Labor Department's July employment figures on Friday showed the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. The percentage of people who are unemployed long-term (27 weeks or longer) shrank from 41.9% in June to 40.7% in July. 

Casillas says his life is evidence that the economy is beginning to turn around. But the road to his new job was painful, heartbreaking and financially devastating. 

July jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises 

He remembers his life pre-November 2008: He wore expensive suits, drove a Mercedes and spent every cent of his paycheck. When he was laid off, he thought he'd be back at work in two weeks. 

He was wrong. 

The subprime mortgage crisis was eating away at the U.S. economy. Employers were shedding jobs, not adding them. A few credits shy of his associate degree, Casillas found himself overqualified for many jobs but underqualified for higher-paid middle-class ones. 

""Overqualified, what does that mean?"" Casillas remembers. ""They kept telling me that. Meanwhile, my life is going down the drain."" 

He lost his house, his Mercedes, and then his wife left him. In his 40s, he was forced to take the humiliating step of moving in with his mother. A year after he lost his job, he began selling everything he owned on Craigslist.  Q: Who's the article about? A: Ernie Casillas. Q: When was he fired? A: November 6, 2008. Q: What was his profession? A: mortgage broker. Q: How much later did he get his next job? A: four years later,. Q: What were the reports posting about employment then? A: the average duration of unemployment shrank from 39.9 weeks in June to 38.8 weeks in July. Q: Who was seeking reelection around this time? A: Obama. Q: What ate away at the economy in the US? A: subprime mortgage crisis. Q: What type of car did he drive? A: his Mercedes. Q: What was the car's fate? A: He lost it. Q: Did he own a home? A: Yes.

Phineas Duge in London was still a man of affairs.

BRINGING IN SOME GAME 

The snowstorm proved such a heavy one that for three days the party at Professor Jeffer's cabin were completely stormbound. Once Andy and Chet went out--in an endeavor to bring the dead moose in, but were unable to accomplish their object. 

During the time spent at the cabin, the boys became very well acquainted with Barwell Dawson, and found the hunter and explorer a person very much to their liking. Although he was rich and well educated, he did not act as if he considered himself above them. He took a lively interest in all they had to tell, and knew how to ""draw them out,"" so that, almost before he knew it, Andy had related the details of his troubles with his shiftless Uncle Si and with the mysterious Mr. A.

""More than likely that fellow, Hopton, will bear close watching,"" said Barwell Dawson. ""If he is a sharper--and it looks as if he might be--he will try to swindle both you and your uncle. It was very unwise for your uncle to try to do business with him without seeing a lawyer."" 

""Uncle Si wanted to get the money without my knowing it,"" answered Andy, bitterly. He was glad to open his heart to somebody who could understand him.

During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. 

Just before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ 

But then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked ""Omani Marketplace"" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! 

In December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . 

More digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years.

MOLLY SIZER'S PARTY 

The people of Chazy County were very proud of the _Millville Tribune_, the only daily paper in that section of the state. It was really a very good newspaper, if small in size, and related the news of the day as promptly as the great New York journals did. 

Arthur Weldon had not been very enthusiastic about the paper at any time, although he humored the girls by attending in a good-natured way to the advertising, hiring some of the country folk to get subscriptions, and keeping the books. He was a young man of considerable education who had inherited a large fortune, safely invested, and therefore had no need, through financial necessity, to interest himself in business of any sort. He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief, but he did no editorial work at all, amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods, where he collected botanical specimens, or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn, where they read together or played chess. Both the men were glad the girls were happy in their work and enthusiastic over the success of their audacious venture. Beth was developing decided talent as a writer of editorials and her articles were even more thoughtful and dignified than were those of Patsy. The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office, while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest. She grew fond of this work, for it brought her close to the people and enabled her to study their characters and peculiarities. Her manner of approaching the simple country folk was so gracious and winning that they freely gave her any information they possessed, and chatted with her unreservedly.  Q: How many daily papers were there in town?? A: one. Q: What was it called? A: the Millville Tribune. Q: Whose enthusiasm in the publication had gone down? A: Arthur's. Q: Was he a poor man? A: no. Q: How had he become wealthy?

LOVERS 

Bernard Maddison kept his engagement that evening, and dined alone with Lady Thurwell and Helen. There had been some talk of going to the opera afterwards, but no one seemed to care about it, and so it dropped through. 

""For my part,"" Lady Thurwell said, as they sat lingering over their dessert, ""I shall quite enjoy an evening's rest. You literary men, Mr. Maddison, talk a good deal about being overworked, but you know nothing of the life of a chaperon in the season. I tell Helen that she is sadly wanting in gratitude. We do everything worth doing--picture galleries, matinées, shopping, afternoon calls, dinners, dances, receptions--why, there's no slavery like it."" 

Helen laughed softly. 

""We do a great deal too much, aunt,"" she said. ""I am almost coming round to my father's opinion. You know, Mr. Maddison, he very seldom comes to London, and then only when he wants to pay a visit to his gunmaker, or to renew his hunting kit, or something of that sort. London life does not suit him at all."" 

""I think your father a very wise man,"" he answered. ""He seeks his pleasures in a more wholesome manner."" 

She looked thoughtful. 

""Yes, I suppose, ethically, the life of a man about town is on a very low level. That is why one meets so few who interest one, as a rule. Don't you think all this society life very frivolous, Mr. Maddison?"" 

""I am not willing to be its judge,"" he answered. ""Yet it is a moral axiom that the higher we seek for our pleasures the greater happiness we attain to. I am an uncompromising enemy to what is known as fashionable society, so I will draw no conclusions.""  Q: Who does city life not favor? A: Helen's father. Q: Does he visit there often? A: no.

Five minutes after Paula had left him, punctual to the second, the four telegrams disposed of, Dick was getting into a ranch motor car, along with Thayer, the Idaho buyer, and Naismith, the special correspondent for the _Breeders' Gazette_. Wardman, the sheep manager, joined them at the corrals where several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection. 

There was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation. 

""They speak for themselves,"" Dick had assured him, and turned aside to give data to Naismith for his impending article on Shropshires in California and the Northwest. 

""I wouldn't advise you to bother to select them,"" Dick told Thayer ten minutes later. ""The average is all top. You could spend a week picking your ten carloads and have no higher grade than if you had taken the first to hand."" 

This cool assumption that the sale was already consummated so perturbed Thayer, that, along with the sure knowledge that he had never seen so high a quality of rams, he was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads. 

As he told Naismith, after they had regained the Big House and as they chalked their cues to finish the interrupted game: 

""It's my first visit to Forrest's. He's a wizard. I've been buying in the East and importing. But those Shropshires won my judgment. You noticed I doubled my order. Those Idaho buyers will be wild for them. I only had buying orders straight for six carloads, and contingent on my judgment for two carloads more; but if every buyer doesn't double his order, straight and contingent, when he sees them rams, and if there isn't a stampede for what's left, I don't know sheep.

But then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked ""Omani Marketplace"" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! 

In December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand!

People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . 

More digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years.

""I shall never like to see the Mediterranean again,"" said Gwendolen, to her mother, who thought that she quite understood her child's feeling--even in her tacit prohibition of any express reference to her late husband. 

Mrs. Davilow, indeed, though compelled formally to regard this time as one of severe calamity, was virtually enjoying her life more than she had ever done since her daughter's marriage. It seemed that her darling was brought back to her not merely with all the old affection, but with a conscious cherishing of her mother's nearness, such as we give to a possession that we have been on the brink of losing. 

""Are you there, mamma?"" cried Gwendolen, in the middle of the night (a bed had been made for her mother in the same room with hers), very much as she would have done in her early girlhood, if she had felt frightened in lying awake.  Q: Who cries out? A: Gwendolen. Q: When? A: in the middle of the night. Q: For whom? A: her mother. Q: Was there a bed for her? A: yes. Q: Where? A: in the same room with hers.

A: to remain at Genoa. Q: How long had she done that after her mom came? A: not many days after. Q: What's Genoa nicknamed? A: flowery vale of Enna. Q: Does Enna have many flowers? A: yes.

7558,"(CNN) -- We should all be so lucky to have friends like Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. Private detectives in modern-day Los Angeles, they're the stars of best-selling author Robert Crais' award-winning series of crime novels. Elvis and Joe have been busting bad guys and thrilling millions of readers since 1987's ""The Monkey's Raincoat."" The books are international bestsellers, published in 42 countries, and have developed a fervent following. 

In ""Taken,"" Crais's newest novel, his 15th featuring the daring duo, Elvis and Joe take on an especially bloodthirsty group of criminals called bajadores. They are bandits who prey on other bandits along the U.S.-Mexico border, dealing in drugs, murder and kidnapping. 

""Taken"" is intense and fast-paced and reads like a big-budget Hollywood blockbuster. Though that's not surprising when you consider Crais began his career writing for television series like ""Hill Street Blues,"" ""Cagney & Lacey"" and ""Miami Vice."" 

CNN recently spoke to the author about his new book, his loyal fans and why he's refused to bring Elvis and Joe to the big screen. The following is an edited transcript. 

CNN: How has writing about Elvis Cole and Joe Pike changed over the course of the series? 

Crais: I really strive to bring something new to each book. I don't want to write the same book over and over again. I've done Elvis books; I've done Joe books; I've done mixed books, but this time, I made a conscious decision I wanted to tell a story where I could split the book pretty much down the middle and give them 50-50 equal footing so they both have their starring roles. When I discovered this particular story, it just seemed a perfect way to do that. Part of the book, they're working together. Then there's Elvis' track through the story, and there's Joe track, where he's trying to find Elvis and save him. So it just seemed like an ideal way to let these guys share the stage.

5558,"Leeds is a city in West Yorkshire, England. Historically in Yorkshire's West Riding, the history of Leeds can be traced to the 5th century, when the name referred to a wooded area of the Kingdom of Elmet. The name has been applied to many administrative entities over the centuries. It changed from being the name of a small manorial borough in the 13th century, through several incarnations, to being the name attached to the present metropolitan borough. In the 17th and 18th centuries Leeds became a major centre for the production and trading of wool. 

During the Industrial Revolution, Leeds developed into a major mill town; wool was the dominant industry but flax, engineering, iron foundries, printing, and other industries were important. From being a compact market town in the valley of the River Aire in the 16th century Leeds expanded and absorbed the surrounding villages to become a populous urban centre by the mid-20th century. Leeds has a population of around 781,700 (2016) making it the third largest city in the United Kingdom. The city lies within the United Kingdom's fourth-most populous urban area, with a population of 2.3 million. 

Today, Leeds has the most diverse economy of all the UK's main employment centres and has seen the fastest rate of private-sector jobs growth of any UK city and has the highest ratio of public to private sector jobs of all the UK's Core Cities. Leeds has the third-largest jobs total by local authority area with 480,000 in employment and self-employment at the beginning of 2015. Leeds is also ranked as a gamma world city by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network; and is considered the cultural, financial and commercial heart of the West Yorkshire Urban Area. Leeds is served by four universities, and has the fourth largest student population in the country and has the country's fourth largest urban economy. Q: What city referred to a wooded area?

The Hound Restored 

On the third day after his arrival at the camp Archie received orders to prepare to start with the hound, with the earl and a large party of men-at-arms, in search of Bruce. A traitor had just come in and told them where Bruce had slept the night before. Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited. He sniffed here and there, eagerly hunted up and down the cottage, then made a circuit round it, and at last, with a loud deep bay he started off with his nose to the ground, pulling so hard at the chain that Archie had difficulty in keeping up with him. Pembroke and his knights rode a little behind, followed by their men-at-arms. 

""I pray you, Sir Earl,"" Archie said, ""keep not too close to my traces, for the sound of the horse's hoofs and the jingling of the equipments make him all the more impatient to get forward, and even now it taxes all my strength to hold him in.""  Q: To whom did Archie pray? A: Sir Earl. Q: And what should Sir Earl not get too close to? A: Archie's traces. Q: What does the sound of horse's hoofs make him impatient to do?

6759,"Fifty-two countries have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since it started in 1956. Of these, twenty-seven have won the contest. The contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), is held annually between members of the Union. Broadcasters from different countries submit songs to the event, and cast votes to determine the most popular in the competition. 

Participation in the contest is primarily open to all active member broadcasters of the EBU. To be an active member, broadcasters must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, or be in a Council of Europe member country. Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the ""Euro"" in ""Eurovision"" — nor does it have a direct connection with the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus and Armenia, in Western Asia, since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone; and Australia making a debut in the 2015 contest. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. Two of the countries that have previously sought to enter the competition, Lebanon and Tunisia, in Western Asia and North Africa respectively, are also outside of Europe. The Gulf state of Qatar, in Western Asia, announced in 2009 its interest in joining the contest in time for the 2011 edition. However, this did not materialise, and there are no known plans for a future Qatari entry the Eurovision Song Contest. Australia, where the contest has been broadcast since the 1970s, debuted as a participant in the 2015 edition, with entries in 2016 and 2017. Q: Who can take part in the contest?

While on a walking tour with his wife, he stopped to talk to a workman. After they had gone on, Mrs. Bussman said that the workman was closely like her husband and even suggested that he might be his brother. Franz laughed at the idea, pointing out that his brother had been killed in action during the war. Though Mrs. Busman knew this story quite well, she thought there was a chance in a million that she might be right. 

A few days later, she sent a boy to the workman to ask him if his name was Hans Bussman. Needless to say, the man's name was Hans Bussman. And he really was Franz's long-lost brother. 

When the brothers were reunited, Hans explained how it was that he was still alive.

It was founded in 1987 by Jim Foster, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America, after the Canadian Football League and the National Football League. It is played indoors on a 68-yard field (about half the distance of an NFL field), resulting in a faster-paced and higher-scoring game. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League and the National Football League. 

For its 2015 season, the league consisted of 12 teams, all from the United States; however, upon the completion of the regular season, the league announced that the two teams it had assumed operation of during the season would cease all operations effective immediately; a regular season game slated between the two had previously been canceled and declared a tie. Subsequently, one of the remaining teams, the Spokane Shock, severed its ties with the league to join the competing IFL. The AFL is divided into two conferences – the American Conference and National Conference. Starting 2016, each conference will have only four teams as the champion San Jose SaberCats announced in November 2015 that they were ceasing activity for ""reasons not associated with League operations.""

1723,"Spain and its autonomous communities are divided into fifty provinces (, ; sing. ""provincia""). Ceuta, Melilla and the Plazas de soberanía are not part of any provinces. 

The layout of Spain's provinces closely follows the pattern of the territorial division of the country carried out in 1833. The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub-division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one. 

Historically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history. The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections and as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes. 

A small town would normally be identified as being in, say, Valladolid province rather than the autonomous community of Castile and León. The provinces were the ""building-blocks"" from which the autonomous communities were created. Consequently, no province is divided between more than one of these communities. 

Most of the provinces—with the exception of Álava/Araba, Asturias/Asturies, Bizkaia/Vizcaya, Cantabria, Gipuzkoa/Gipúzcoa, Illes Balears/Islas Baleares, La Rioja, and Nafarroa/Navarra—are named after their principal town.

THE CURE 

It was noon when Harding returned to camp, ragged and exhausted, with Clarke limping after him in an even more pitiable state. The latter had suffered badly from the hurried march, but his conductor would brook no delay and the grim hints he had been given encouraged him to the utmost exertion he was capable of. Blake was alive, but when Harding bent over him he feared that help had come too late. His skin looked harsh and dry, his face had grown hollow, and his thick strong hair had turned lank and was falling out. His eyes were vacant and unrecognizing when he turned them upon Harding. 

""Here's your patient,"" the American said to Clarke. ""We expect you to cure him, and you had better get to work at once."" Then his face grew troubled as he asked Benson: ""How long has he been like that?"" 

""The last two days,"" said Benson. ""I'm afraid he's very bad."" 

Harding sat down with a smothered groan. Every muscle seemed to ache, he could scarcely hold himself upright, and his heart was heavy. He would miss Blake terribly; it was hard to think of going on without him, but he feared that this was inevitable. He was filled with a deep pity for the helpless man, but after a few moments his weary face grew stern.

6757,"Fifty-two countries have participated in the Eurovision Song Contest since it started in 1956. Of these, twenty-seven have won the contest. The contest, organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), is held annually between members of the Union. Broadcasters from different countries submit songs to the event, and cast votes to determine the most popular in the competition. 

Participation in the contest is primarily open to all active member broadcasters of the EBU. To be an active member, broadcasters must be a member of the European Broadcasting Union, or be in a Council of Europe member country. Eligibility to participate is not determined by geographic inclusion within the continent of Europe, despite the ""Euro"" in ""Eurovision"" — nor does it have a direct connection with the European Union. Several countries geographically outside the boundaries of Europe have competed: Israel, Cyprus and Armenia, in Western Asia, since 1973, 1981 and 2006 respectively; Morocco, in North Africa, in the 1980 competition alone; and Australia making a debut in the 2015 contest. In addition, several transcontinental countries with only part of their territory in Europe have competed: Turkey, since 1975; Russia, since 1994; Georgia, since 2007; and Azerbaijan, which made its first appearance in the 2008 edition. Two of the countries that have previously sought to enter the competition, Lebanon and Tunisia, in Western Asia and North Africa respectively, are also outside of Europe. The Gulf state of Qatar, in Western Asia, announced in 2009 its interest in joining the contest in time for the 2011 edition. However, this did not materialise, and there are no known plans for a future Qatari entry the Eurovision Song Contest. Australia, where the contest has been broadcast since the 1970s, debuted as a participant in the 2015 edition, with entries in 2016 and 2017. Q: Who can take part in the contest? A: all active member broadcasters of the EBU. Q: What is one way to be a member? A: be a member of the European Broadcasting Union. Q: And another? A: be in a Council of Europe member country. Q: Do you need to be located in Europe? A: no. Q: Have any countries competed that are not in Europe? A: yes. Q: Has the U.S.? A: unknown. Q: What about Australia? A: yes. Q: What year? A: 2015.

979,"(Entertainment Weekly) -- How are the elements of the charming, traditional romantic comedy ""The Proposal"" like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride? Let me count the ways ... 

Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in ""The Proposal."" 

Something old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? 

Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. 

And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is ""X-Men's"" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) 

Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) 

OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue. 

Something new: The chemical energy between Bullock and Reynolds is fresh and irresistible. In her mid-40s, Bullock has finessed her dewy America's Sweetheart comedy skills to a mature, pearly texture; she's lovable both as an uptight careerist in a pencil skirt and stilettos, and as a lonely lady in a flapping plaid bathrobe.  Q: What movie is the article referring to? A: The Proposal. Q: What type of film is it? A: romantic comedy. Q: What comparison does the article attempt to make? A: How the elements of the comedy are like the checklist of a charming, traditional bride?. Q: Who are the 2 main actors/actresses in the film? A: Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock. Q: Is he the supervisor? A: No. Q: Do the 2 start out liking each other? A: no. Q: What is the boss's name in the film? A: Margaret,. Q: Is her co-star's character named Daniel? A: no. Q: What is his occupation? A: executive assistant. Q: What is hers?

Not two, not four, but three. When your wish arrives, give the bell to someone else. Pedro thanked the girl for the bell, and when she had gone, he rang the bell three times and wished for a puppy.

7865,"Years ago, when I started looking for my first job, wise advisers advised, ""Barbara, be enthusiastic ! Enthusiasm will take you further than any amount of experience."" How right they were! 

""Nothing great was ever done without enthusiasm,"" wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson. It is the paste that helps you hang in there when the things get tough. It is the inner voice that tells you, ""I can do it!"" when others shout, ""No, you can't!"" It took years and years for the early work of Barbara McClintock, a geneticist who won the 1983 Nobel Prize in medicine, to be generally accepted. Yet she didn't stop working on her experiments. 

We are all born with wide-eyed, enthusiastic wonder and it is the childlike wonder that gives enthusiastic people such youthful air, whatever their age. At 90, cellist Pablo Casals would start his day by playing the cello . As the music flowed through his fingers, his shoulders would straighten and joy would reappear in his eyes. As writer and poet Samuel Ullman once worte, ""Years wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul."" 

Enthusiastic people also love what they do, not considering money or title or power. Patricia Mellratl, a retired director of the Missouri Rpertory Theater in Kansas City, was once asked where she got her enthusiasm. She replied, ""My father, long ago, told me, 'I never made any money until I stopped working for it.'"" 

We can't afford to waste tears on ""might-have-been"". We need to turn the tears into sweat as we go after ""what-can-be"". We need to live each moment whole-heartedly, with all our senses finding pleasure in the sweet of a backyard garden, the simple picture of a six-year-old, and the beauty of a rainbow.

Beautiful to watch her as she arranged their forms and composed their groups; to mark her eye glance with gratification at some happy combination of colour, or to listen to her delight as they wafted to her in gratitude their perfume. Oswald and Sir Joseph were surveying the stables; Mr. Millbank, who had been daily expected for the last week from the factories, had not yet arrived. 

'I must say he gained my heart from the first,' said Lady Wallinger. 

'I wish the gardener would send us more roses,' said Edith. 

'He is so very superior to any young man I ever met,' continued Lady Wallinger.

THE MEETING FOR RAIN. 

Meanwhile the Auld Lichts were in church, waiting for their minister, and it was a full meeting, because nearly every well in Thrums had been scooped dry by anxious palms. Yet not all were there to ask God's rain for themselves. Old Charles Yuill was in his pew, after dreaming thrice that he would break up with the drought; and Bell Christison had come, though her man lay dead at home, and she thought it could matter no more to her how things went in the world. 

You, who do not love that little congregation, would have said that they were waiting placidly. But probably so simple a woman as Meggy Rattray could have deceived you into believing that because her eyes were downcast she did not notice who put the three-penny- bit in the plate. A few men were unaware that the bell was working overtime, most of them farmers with their eyes on the windows, but all the women at least were wondering. They knew better, however, than to bring their thoughts to their faces, and none sought to catch another's eye. The men-folk looked heavily at their hats in the seats in front. Even when Hendry Munn, instead of marching to the pulpit with the big Bible in his hands, came as far as the plate and signed to Peter Tosh, elder, that he was wanted in the vestry, you could not have guessed how every woman there, except Bell Christison, wished she was Peter Tosh. Peter was so taken aback that he merely gaped at Hendry, until suddenly he knew that his five daughters were furious with him, when he dived for his hat and staggered to the vestry with his mouth open. His boots cheeped all the way, but no one looked up.  Q: Who gaped at Hendry? A: Peter. Q: How many daughters were there? A: five daughters. Q: Whose man was dead at home? A: Bell Christison's.

2970,"The Chicago Tribune is a daily newspaper based in Chicago, Illinois, United States, owned by Tronc, Inc., formerly Tribune Publishing. Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the ""World's Greatest Newspaper"" (for which WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the ""Chicago Tribune""s parent company purchased the ""Los Angeles Times""). 

Traditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the ""Tribune"" announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the ""Tribune"" discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels. 

The ""Tribune""s masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, ""An American Paper for Americans."" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag. 

The ""Tribune"" was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the ""Tribune"" was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance. However nativist its editorials may have been, it was not until February 10, 1855 that the ""Tribune"" formally affiliated itself with the nativist American or Know Nothing party, whose candidate Levi Boone was elected Mayor of Chicago the following month. Q: Who founded the paper? A: James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest. Q: when was the first edition published? A: June 10, 1847. Q: Did it have a political affiliation then? A: no. Q: What kind of editorials did it often print by 1853? A: xenophobic. Q: did it criticize specific groups of people? A: yes. Q: which ones? A: foreigners and Roman Catholics. Q: Did it publish pieces against temperance? A: no. Q: when did it publically affiliate itself with the Nativist Party? A: February 10, 1855. Q: Who owns the paper now? A: Tronc, Inc.

The tree was planted in 1896 and has grown to over fifty feet tall with branches that were another thirty feet wide. Next to the tree is a jungle gym. The jungle gym has two slides, a fireman pole, a rock climbing wall, and much more. One day the kids in the neighborhood came up with the idea of building a tree house so they could spend all of their time at the park, even when it was raining outside.

Every day during the summer that year the children played in the park and went in the tree house from sunrise to sunset every day. Fifteen years have gone by and the children are now too old to use the tree house. The tree house still sits on the tree but instead has a new group of kids that get to enjoy the house.

The American Football Conference (AFC) champion Denver Broncos defeated the National Football Conference (NFC) champion Carolina Panthers 24–10 to earn their third Super Bowl title. The game was played on February 7, 2016, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area at Santa Clara, California. As this was the 50th Super Bowl, the league emphasized the ""golden anniversary"" with various gold-themed initiatives, as well as temporarily suspending the tradition of naming each Super Bowl game with Roman numerals (under which the game would have been known as ""Super Bowl L""), so that the logo could prominently feature the Arabic numerals 50. 

The Panthers finished the regular season with a 15–1 record, and quarterback Cam Newton was named the NFL Most Valuable Player (MVP). They defeated the Arizona Cardinals 49–15 in the NFC Championship Game and advanced to their second Super Bowl appearance since the franchise was founded in 1995. The Broncos finished the regular season with a 12–4 record, and denied the New England Patriots a chance to defend their title from Super Bowl XLIX by defeating them 20–18 in the AFC Championship Game.

3209,"A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. 

Law enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree. The police force is usually a public sector service, meaning they are paid through taxes. Q: Is enforcing the law the entire goal of police? A: No. Q: What is their main activity concerned with? A: preservation of order. Q: In the 17-1800s, what was one other thing they were focused on? A: maintaining the class system. Q: Anything else? A: protection of private property. Q: Is it true that there has been corruption in the police department? A: Yes. Q: Just a few instances?

5109,"(CNN) -- The man labeled the most powerful vice president in American history remains resolute in his steadfast defense of his time in the White House in a new documentary that begins airing Friday. 

""I did what I did. It's all on the public record, and I feel very good about it. If I had to do it over again, I'd do it in a minute,"" Dick Cheney says in ""The World According to Dick Cheney,"" which debuts at 9 p.m. ET on Showtime. 

The two-hour documentary tells the story of Cheney's life through his own comments, supplemented by a narrator and interviews with journalists, biographers, former aides and his longtime friend and mentor Donald Rumsfeld, the former secretary of Defense. 

While the film covers Cheney's unprecedented and controversial role as vice president, the first half of the film explores the surprising tale of his rise from a two-time Yale dropout with two drunk-driving arrests to the man who once stood behind the leader of the free world. 

In ""The World According to Dick Cheney,"" produced by R.J. Cutler — also known for ""The War Room"" and ""The September Issue"" -- the former Washington powerhouse gets personal, but he still maintains his ever-steady, matter-of-fact tone. 

""When you came in at night after work, you'd go to the bar and down large quantities of Coors beer,"" he stated coolly, referring to the two times he was arrested for drinking and driving in his home state of Wyoming. 

Noticeably absent from the documentary are details about Cheney's post-White House life. The 72-year-old gives little to no insight about his heart transplant last year or his decision to support same-sex marriage. His younger daughter Mary wed her longtime partner Heather Poe in June.

2380,"There was once a small, grey cat that lived in the woods. This was a lonely old cat that spent most of his time bullying other small animals that lived in the woods. Almost all of the other little animals who lived in the woods knew of the old cat, and warned everyone they knew to stay away from him. 

One day a young mouse was out taking a walk to collect some berries. It was a nice day out, so the mouse chose to go down by the river to take a quick rest for a bit. When the mouse arrived at the river he found the perfect spot to rest. It was a small little area with soft sand to lie on, under a tree that gave a bit of shade. The mouse then sat back. After a little bit of time the mouse was fast asleep. 

Not long after the mouse had fallen asleep, the cat caught a scent in the air of the young mouse. The cat walked slowly up to the spot where the mouse was sleeping and licked his lips. Right when the cat was about to catch the mouse, the mouse woke up. 

""What are you doing?!"" asked the mouse in surprise. 

""I am trying to find dinner,"" said the cat. 

The mouse smiled. ""I collected extra berries today on my walk. Would you like to have some?"" 

The cat was confused. He had never been given such a kind thing. ""Well, OK. Berries are not my favorite, but I guess that they are OK."" 

The cat and mouse then sat down together and ate a meal of tasty berries. It turned out that the cat was not so terrible after all-but had never been given kindness. Q: What color was the cat?

3745,"CHAPTER XXV. THE VELVET COACH 



No, my good Lord, Diana-- ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL 

A late autumn journey from the west coast to Paris was a more serious undertaking in the sixteenth century than the good seaman Master Hobbs was aware of, or he would have used stronger dissuasive measures against such an undertaking by the two youths, when the elder was in so frail a state of health; but there had been a certain deceptive strength and vigour about young Ribaumont while under strong excitement and determination, and the whole party fancied him far fitter to meet the hardships than was really the case. Philip Thistlewood always recollected that journey as the most distressing period of his life. 

They were out of the ordinary highways, and therefore found the hiring of horses often extremely difficult. They had intended to purchase, but found no animals that, as Philip said, they would have accepted as a gift, though at every wretched inn where they had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades, their proposed requirements fell lower and lower. Dens of smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion of those inns, where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down of one or other of the beasts, or by stress of weather. Snow, rain, thaw and frost alternated, each variety rendering the roads impassable; and at the best, the beasts could seldom be urged beyond a walk, fetlock-deep in mire or water. Worse than all, Berenger, far from recovered, and under the heavy oppression of a heartrending grief, could hardly fail to lose the ground that he had gained under the influence of hope. The cold seemed to fix itself on the wound on his cheek, terrible pain and swelling set in, depriving him entirely of sleep, permitting him to take no nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or broth--when the inns afforded any such fare--and rendering speech excessively painful, and at last unintelligible.

4235,"BAGHDAD, Iraq (CNN) -- The Iraqi man who was jailed after throwing his shoes at then-President George W. Bush last year arrived in Syria on Tuesday night, hours after being released from prison, his employer said. 

Muntadhar al-Zaidi speaks to reporters shorlty after his release from an Iraqi jail. 

Al-Baghdadia TV said Muntadhar al-Zaidi had arrived in Damascus. 

Al-Zaidi's brother, Dhirgham al-Zaidi, told CNN that the 30-year-old journalist was to travel in a private plane to Greece for medical treatment. 

Shortly after he left prison, the 30-year-old journalist visited the studios of his employer, Al-Baghdadia TV, where he spoke to other reporters about his experience. He wore a sash in the colors of the Iraqi national flag draped around his shoulders. 

Muntadhar al-Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush. He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued. 

However, he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison. 

""I got my chance, and I didn't miss it,"" he said. 

""I am not a hero, and I admit that,"" he added. ""I am a person with a stance. I saw my country burning.""

3985,"George Zimmerman, set to stand trial in the 2012 shooting death of teenager Trayvon Martin, on Tuesday waived his right to a ""stand your ground"" pretrial immunity hearing. Zimmerman's attorneys have decided they will try this as a self-defense case. 

Florida's deadly force law, also called ""stand your ground"", was passed in 2005. It allows people to meet ""force with force"" if they believe they or someone else is in danger of being seriously harmed by an assailant. Under the law, a person can use deadly force anywhere as long as he is not engaged in an unlawful activity, is being attacked in a place he has a right to be, and reasonably believes that his life and safety are in danger as a result of an overt act or perceived threat committed by someone else. 

In a pretrial immunity hearing, a judge would have ruled whether Zimmerman's actions were protected under the ""stand your ground"" law; a ruling in favor of the defendant would have meant that no criminal or civil trial could proceed. 

Martin was shot and killed on February 26, 2012, while returning from a nearby convenience store to his father's fiancée's house in a gated community in Sanford, Florida. 

Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch captain, acknowledged that he shot the unarmed 17-year-old, but said Martin physically attacked him and he fired in self-defense. Initially, no charges were pursued, and the case soon became the center of a national controversy. 

Zimmerman was charged with second-degree murder on April 11, 2012.  Q: Who was in court on Tuesday? A: George Zimmerman. Q: What job did he have where he lived? A: neighborhood watch captain. Q: What was he charged with? A: second-degree murder. Q: What state is he from? A: Florida. Q: And what city? A: Sanford, Florida. Q: What kind of defense will the lawyers use? A: a self-defense case. Q: What is the deadly force law nicknamed? A: ""stand your ground"". Q: When was it passed? A: 2005. Q: When can Floridians use deadly force?

890,"Zen () is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that originated in China during the Tang dynasty as Chan Buddhism. Zen school was strongly influenced by Taoism and developed as a distinct school of Chinese Buddhism. From China, Chan Buddhism spread south to Vietnam, northeast to Korea and east to Japan, where it became known as Japanese Zen. 

The term Zen is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 (Chan) which traces its roots to the Indian practice of Dhyana (""meditation""). Zen emphasizes rigorous self-control, meditation-practice, insight into Buddha-nature, and the personal expression of this insight in daily life, especially for the benefit of others. As such, it de-emphasizes mere knowledge of sutras and doctrine and favors direct understanding through zazen and interaction with an accomplished teacher. 

The teachings of Zen include various sources of Mahayana thought, especially Yogachara, the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras and the Huayan school, with their emphasis on Buddha-nature, totality, and the Bodhisattva-ideal. The Prajñāpāramitā literature and, to a lesser extent, Madhyamaka have also been influential in the shaping of the ""paradoxical language"" of the Zen-tradition. 

The word ""Zen"" is derived from the Japanese pronunciation of the Middle Chinese word 禪 () (pinyin: ""Chán""), which in turn is derived from the Sanskrit word ""dhyāna"" (ध्यान ), which can be approximately translated as ""absorption"" or ""meditative state"". Q: Zen is part of which religion? A: Buddhism. Q: What is it a school of? A: Mahayana Buddhism. Q: Where did that type come from? A: China. Q: When? A: During the Tang dynasty. Q: What influenced Zen? A: Taoism. Q: Name a country to which it spread from China. A: Japan. Q: Name something the teachings of Zen emphasizes. A: Meditation-practice. Q: What else? A: Rigorous self-control. Q: And what else? A: Insight into Buddha's nature. Q: When should that insight be expressed? A: All the time, especially for the benefit of others. Q: Does Zen value mere knowledge of doctrine? A: No. Q: What does it value instead? A: Direct understanding. Q: Through what? A: Through ""zazen"" and interaction with an accomplished teacher. Q: What Chinese word does Zen trace back to? A: 禪. Q: What Sanskrit word does this come from in turn? A: ध्यान. Q: What is a meaning of this word? A: ""absorption"" or ""meditative state"".

7065,"Before Nicholas Clapp got there, he had half hoped that he might run into some of Ubar's ruins sticking out of the sand. But finding the city wasn't that easy. During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. 

Just before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ 

But then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked ""Omani Marketplace"" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! 

In December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . 

More digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years. Clapp and his team were excited as they continued to discover more pieces of the past that seemed to prove that it was the lost city of Ubar. 

""We started with this hopeless myth ,"" says Clapp, ""and then finally found the truth behind the myth."" But is this unearthed site really the once-great Ubar? Experts aren't totally persuaded. 

Donald Whitcomb is an archeologist at the University of Chicago. He doubts that Clapp really discovered Ubar. ""There's probably some truth to this myth,"" he says. ""But Ubar is described as a place with walls all made of gold, and the rubies and emeralds ."" No gold or precious stones have been found by Clapp. 

""I'm not sure whether they discovered Ubar because I'm not sure if Ubar really existed,"" Whitcomb says. Q: Where did the caravan routes merge? A: ""Omani Marketplace"". Q: Marked on whose map? A: Ptolomy's. Q: How far apart were the 2 maps created? A: almost 2000 years. Q: Did they end up pointing to the same area? A: yes. Q: Who wished he would come across portions of Ubar's ruins?

For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry. So long as the way was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere. 

During this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an entire series of names for himself. This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing. 

""A name he must have had,"" he argued to Villa. ""Haggin must have named him before he sailed on the _Arangi_. Therefore, nameless he must be until we get back to Tulagi and find out his real name."" 

""What's in a name?"" Villa had begun to tease. 

""Everything,"" her husband retorted. ""Think of yourself, shipwrecked, called by your rescuers 'Mrs. Riggs,' or 'Mademoiselle de Maupin,' or just plain 'Topsy.' And think of me being called 'Benedict Arnold,' or ' Judas,' or . . . or . . . 'Haman.' No, keep him nameless, until we find out his original name."" 

""Must call him something,"" she objected. ""Can't think of him without thinking something.""

4348,"Steven Spielberg was not a scholar, and his classmates teased him. Rather than read, the kid really preferred running around with an 8mm camera, shooting homemade movies, which he showed to friends for a small fee. 

In his first year of high school, he dropped out. But when his parents persuaded him to return, he was mistakenly placed in a learningdisabled class, which lasted one month. Only when the family moved to another town did he land up in a more suitable high school, where he eventually graduated. 

After being denied entrance into a traditional filmmaking school, Steven Spielherg enrolled in English at California State University at Long Beach. Then in 1965, he recalls, in one of those serendipitous moments, his life took a complete turn. Visiting Universal Studios, he met Chuck Silvers, an executive in the editorial department. Silvers liked the kid who made 8mm films and invited him back sometime to visit. 

He appeared the next day. Spielberg, dressed in a dark suit, carrying his father's briefcase with nothing inside but a sandwich and candy bars walked confidently up to the guard at the gate of Universal and gave him a casual wave. The guard waved back. He was in. 

""For the entire summer,"" Spielberg remembers, ""I dressed in my suit and hung out with the directors and writers, including Silvers, who knew the kid wasn't a studio employee, but winked at him. I even found an office that wasn't being used, and became a squatter . I bought some plastic tiles and put my name in the building directory: Steven Spielberg, Room 23C."" 

It paid off for everyone. Ten years later, the 28yearold Spielberg directed Jaws, which took in $470 million, then the biggest grossing movie of all time. Dozens of films and awards have followed because Steven Spielberg knew what his teachers didn't--talent is in the eyes of the filmmaker.

5421,"The Board Meeting had come to an end. Bob started to stand up and knocked into the table, spilling his coffee over his notes. ""How embarrassing! I am getting so clumsy in my old age."" 

Everyone had a good laugh, and soon we were all telling stories of our most embarrassing moments. It came around to Frank, who sat quietly listening to the others. Someone said, ""Come on, Frank. Tell us your most embarrassing moment."" 

Frank laughed and began to tell us of his childhood. ""I grew up in San Pedro. My Dad was a fisherman, and he loved the sea. He had his own boat, but it was hard making a living on the sea. He worked hard and would stay out until he caught enough to feed the family. Not just enough for our family, but also for his Mom and Dad and the other kids that were still at home."" 

He looked at us and said, ""I wish you could have met my Dad. He was a big man, and he was strong from pulling the nets and fighting the seas for his catch. When you got close to him, he smelled like the ocean. He would wear his old canvas, foul-weather coat and his bibbed overalls. His rain hat would be pulled down over his brow. No matter how much my mother washed them, they would still smell of the sea and of fish."" 

Frank's voice dropped a bit. ""When the weather was bad he would drive me to school. He had this old truck that he used in his fishing business. That truck was older than he was. It would wheeze and rattle down the road. You could hear it coming for blocks. As he would drive toward the school, I would shrink down into the seat hoping to disappear. Half the time, he would slam to a stop and the old truck would belch a cloud of smoke. He would pull right up in front, and it seemed like everybody would be standing around and watching. Then he would lean over and give me a big kiss on the cheek and tell me to be a good boy. It was so embarrassing for me. Here, I was twelve years old, and my Dad would lean over and kiss me goodbye!"" 

He paused and then went on, ""I remember the day I decided I was too old for a goodbye kiss. When we got to the school and came to a stop, he had his usual big smile. He started to lean toward me, but I put my hand up and said, ""No, Dad."" It was the first time I had ever talked to him that way, and he had this surprised look on his face. I said, ""Dad, I'm too old for a goodbye kiss. I'm too old for any kind of kiss."" My Dad looked at me for the longest time, and his eyes started to tear up. Then he turned and looked out of the windshield . ""You're right,"" he said. "" You are a big boy....a man. I won't kiss you anymore."" 

Frank got a funny look on his face, and the tears began to well up in his eyes, as he spoke. ""It wasn't long after that when my Dad went to sea and never came back. It was a day when most of the fleet stayed in, but not Dad. He had a big family to feed. They found his boat adrift with its nets half in and half out. He must have gotten into a strong wind and was trying to save the nets and the floats."" 

I looked at Frank and saw that tears were running down his cheeks. Frank spoke again. ""Guys, you don't know what I would give to have my Dad give me just one more kiss on the cheek...to feel his rough old face... to smell the ocean on him... to feel his arm around my neck. _ . If I had been a man, I would never have told my Dad I was too old for a goodbye kiss."" Q: Why is Frank crying? A: Dad went to sea and never came back. Q: Where did he grow up? A: San Pedro.

5742,"(CNN) -- A man who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon attack is engaged to the woman he was waiting for at the finish line. 

Jeff Bauman, 28, is also expected a child this summer with fiancee Erin Hurley, 27, according to an announcement on his foundation's Facebook page: 

""We are so happy to share with you exciting news that has happened over the last few months...Jeff and Erin became engaged and are expecting their first child in the summer!!! Congratulations Jeff and Erin!!"" 

The posting did not reveal a due date for the child or a wedding date. 

Bauman is credited with helping investigators identify the suspects in the April 15, 2013, double bombing. 

The image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. 

A day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. 

Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. 

Bauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled ""Stronger"" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. 

""The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals,"" he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.

It was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. 

On Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. 

""We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before,"" Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. ""He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends."" 

Nowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. 

Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch. 

""My wife spent countless hours at that park consoling this boy,"" he said. ""She was really good to him. She fed him, she gave him money. She told him to pull his pants up and to be a man. More times than I can count.""

It will be remembered that some weeks before Elsa's forced marriage in the Red Mill, Foy, on their escape from the Gevangenhuis, had been carried upon the naked back of Martin to the shelter of Mother Martha's lair in the Haarlemer Meer. Here he lay sick many days, for the sword cut in his thigh festered so badly that at one time his life was threatened by gangrene, but, in the end, his own strength and healthy constitution, helped with Martha's simples, cured him. So soon as he was strong again, accompanied by Martin, he travelled into Leyden, which now it was safe enough for him to visit, since the Spaniards were driven from the town. 

How his young heart swelled as, still limping a little and somewhat pale from recent illness, he approached the well-known house in the Bree Straat, the home that sheltered his mother and his love. Presently he would see them again, for the news had been brought to him that Lysbeth was out of danger and Elsa must still be nursing her. 

Lysbeth he found indeed, turned into an old woman by grief and sore sickness, but Elsa he did not find. She had vanished. On the previous night she had gone out to take the air, and returned no more.

1630,"Ron Meyer is the president and COO of Universal Studios.As one of the most successful business leaders in Hollywood, he heads up Universal Pictures and Universal Parks & Resorts.He's the guy who oversees the production of Multimillion-dollar extravaganzas likeKing KongandCinderella Man. 

Meyer's story sounds like the plot of one of his motion pictures.He grew up in a modest home where there was little income.It was a big deal to go to a restaurant.At 15, he quit high school and spent his time hanging out with the neighborhood toughs .He was then a kid quick with his fists who seemed to get into fights somewhat regularly.At one point, he was separated from others with an infectious disease, having no TV and nothing to do.His mother sent him two books.One wasThe Amboy Dukes, a novel about kids in street gangs.The other wasThe Flesh Peddlers, about a guy in the talent agency who lived a successful life.""I realized,"" he says, ""that I was no longer that silly kid I had been, and I wanted to change my life."" 

Meyer took any job he could get.He worked as a busboy and short-order cook.He cleaned offices and sold shoes.That attitude made an impression on people.One day he received a call from Paul Kohner, a successful agent who represented stars like John Huston, Charles Bronson and Lana Turner.Their messenger and driver had quit, and they knew Ron was willing to take whatever job they offered. He started the job the next day. 

Meyer was lucky to work with a good boss--and _ .In nearly six years of driving for Kohner, Meyer became his right-hand man and learned a lot.By the 1970s, Meyer had built many relationships in the business.In 1975, the fate presented an opportunity and he started his own operation Creative Artists Agency, which became a huge success, representing Hollywood legends like Barbra Streisand, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise. 

Twenty years later, Meyer was appointed to run Universal Studios, a position far beyond his youthful dream.But once he saw success was possible, he was driven to achieve it.Today, colleagues regularly owe his success--and theirs--to his humility and perseverance.It's a level of success that takes determination, personality and intelligence, whether it comes from a college education or from the street. Q: Meyer grew up where ? A: Universal Parks & Resorts. Q: where is he the president ? A: Universal Studios. Q: hom many multi million dollar productions he did ? A: Two. Q: did he finish school ?

The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in ""Guinness World Records"" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloging and verification of a huge number of world records; the organization employs official record adjudicators authorized to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. 

On 10 November 1951, Sir Hugh Beaver, then the managing director of the Guinness Breweries, went on a shooting party in the North Slob, by the River Slaney in County Wexford, Ireland. After missing a shot at a golden plover, he became involved in an argument over which was the fastest game bird in Europe, the golden plover or the red grouse. (It is the plover.) That evening at Castlebridge House, he realized that it was impossible to confirm in reference books whether or not the golden plover was Europe's fastest game bird. Beaver knew that there must be numerous other questions debated nightly in pubs throughout Ireland and abroad, but there was no book in the world with which to settle arguments about records. He realized then that a book supplying the answers to this sort of question might prove successful. Q: What does the Guinness Book record? A: world records.

It was late ere Alleyne Edricson, having carried Sir Nigel the goblet of spiced wine which it was his custom to drink after the curling of his hair, was able at last to seek his chamber. It was a stone-flagged room upon the second floor, with a bed in a recess for him, and two smaller pallets on the other side, on which Aylward and Hordle John were already snoring. Alleyne had knelt down to his evening orisons, when there came a tap at his door, and Ford entered with a small lamp in his hand. His face was deadly pale, and his hand shook until the shadows flickered up and down the wall. 

""What is it, Ford?"" cried Alleyne, springing to his feet. 

""I can scarce tell you,"" said he, sitting down on the side of the couch, and resting his chin upon his hand. ""I know not what to say or what to think."" 

""Has aught befallen you, then?"" 

""Yes, or I have been slave to my own fancy. I tell you, lad, that I am all undone, like a fretted bow-string. Hark hither, Alleyne! it cannot be that you have forgotten little Tita, the daughter of the old glass-stainer at Bordeaux?"" 

""I remember her well."" 

""She and I, Alleyne, broke the lucky groat together ere we parted, and she wears my ring upon her finger. 'Caro mio,' quoth she when last we parted, 'I shall be near thee in the wars, and thy danger will be my danger.' Alleyne, as God is my help, as I came up the stairs this night I saw her stand before me, her face in tears, her hands out as though in warning--I saw it, Alleyne, even as I see those two archers upon their couches. Our very finger-tips seemed to meet, ere she thinned away like a mist in the sunshine.""  Q: Did Alleyene seek his chamber early? A: No. Q: What did he have to do first? A: serve wine. Q: To who?

1707,"Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin, while its largest conurbation is the Ruhr, with its main centres of Dortmund and Essen. The country's other major cities are Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Düsseldorf, Leipzig, Bremen, Dresden, Hannover and Nuremberg. 

Various Germanic tribes have inhabited the northern parts of modern Germany since classical antiquity. A region named Germania was documented before 100 AD. During the Migration Period, the Germanic tribes expanded southward. Beginning in the 10th century, German territories formed a central part of the Holy Roman Empire. During the 16th century, northern German regions became the centre of the Protestant Reformation. After the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire, the German Confederation was formed in 1815. The German revolutions of 1848–49 resulted in the Frankfurt Parliament establishing major democratic rights. 

In 1871, Germany became a nation state when most of the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the German Revolution of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary Weimar Republic. In 1933 the Nazi seizure of power quickly led to the establishment of Nazi Germany which was built upon a dictatorship and consequently led to World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990. Q: When did Germany become a nation state? A: In 1871. Q: What years were the German Revolution? A: 1918–19. Q: After that event, What was the Empire replaced by? A: Weimar Republic. Q: When did the Nazi seizure of power happen? A: In 1933. Q: Did this lead to the establishment of Nazi Germany? A: Yes. Q: What was that built upon? A: A dictatorship. Q: How many events did that cause? A: Two. Q: What was the first one? A: World War II.

LITTLE NELL--CONCLUSION 

Jean Bevoir was now thoroughly cowed, and once having exposed himself he did all in his power to curry favor with those he had so deeply wronged, in the hope that they would relent in their treatment of him and perhaps grant him his ultimate liberty. But neither Henry nor the others would make him any promises, for nobody had any intention of letting him go free. 

""He deserves to become a prisoner,"" said Dave. ""And he ought to be put in solitary confinement and on bread and water."" 

""Right ye are, lad,"" said Barringford. ""He's wuss nor a snake in the grass. I don't wonder Henry felt like pepperin' him on the spot."" 

It was well along in the middle of the afternoon and the rangers who had been out on the hunt were thoroughly tired, yet it was arranged that those who had remained in camp should move to the cave near the falls without delay, after getting minute directions from Jean Bevoir, so that there should be no chance of making a mistake in the route. A strict guard was ordered over the trader and he was given to understand that if anything went wrong with those who set out on the search for little Nell and the others the blame would fall upon him. 

It must be said that the hearts of both Henry and Dave beat rapidly as they pushed along the trail leading towards the falls. Henry, as we know, loved his little sister dearly, and Dave's affection for his little cousin was scarcely less strong. Throughout the whole campaign there had not been a day when they had not thought of her and of what she must be suffering.  Q: What did Dave think Jean deserved? A: To become a prisoner. Q: Where did he think they should put him? A: In solitary confinement. Q: Would he be allowed to eat? A: Bread and water. Q: Who agreed with him? A: Barringford. Q: Who wanted to shoot Jean?

The trees stood with wet feet where just a little while before had been the strange pond in the Green Forest, the pond made by the dam of Paddy the Beaver. In the dam was a great hole made by Paddy himself. 

Through the Green Forest rang the laughter of the Laughing Brook, for once more the water ran deep between its banks. And in the hearts of Grandfather Frog and Jerry Muskrat and Spotty the Turtle was laughter also, for now the Smiling Pool would smile once more, and they could go home in peace and happiness. And there was one more who laughed. Who was it? Why, Paddy the Beaver to be sure, and his was the best laugh of all, for it was because he had brought happiness to others.

2180,"The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR, Russian: СССР), was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. Nominally a union of multiple equal national Soviet republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The country was a one-party state, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. The Russian nation had constitutionally equal status among the many nations of the union but exerted de facto dominance in various respects. Other major urban centres were Leningrad, Kiev, Minsk, Alma-Ata and Novosibirsk. The Soviet Union was one of the five recognized nuclear weapons states and possessed the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction. It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, as well as a member of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) and the Warsaw Pact. 

The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917, when the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Russian Provisional Government which had replaced Tsar Nicholas II during World War I. In 1922, the Soviet Union was formed with the unification of the Russian, Transcaucasian, Ukrainian, and Byelorussian republics. Following Lenin's death in 1924 and a brief power struggle, Joseph Stalin came to power in the mid-1920s. Stalin committed the state's ideology to Marxism–Leninism (which he created), and initiated a centrally planned economy which led to a period of rapid industrialization and collectivization. During this period of totalitarian rule, Stalin imposed political paranoia; the mid-1930s Great Purge removed his opponents within and outside of the party via arbitrary arrests and persecutions of many people. Suppression of political critics, forced labor, and famines were perpetrated by Stalin; in 1933, a major famine struck Soviet Ukraine, causing the deaths of over 7 million people. Q: Who led the Bolsheviks? A: Vladimir Lenin,. Q: What did they overthrow? A: Russian Provisional Government. Q: Which had replaced the rule of whom? A: Tsar Nicholas II. Q: When did the overthrow occur? A: 1917,. Q: Who succeeded Lenin? A: Joseph Stalin. Q: When? A: the mid-1920s. Q: When was the Great Purge? A: the mid-1930s. Q: True or False: Stalin tolerated political criticism. A: false. Q: What did he cause in 1933? A: a major famine. Q: Where? A: Soviet Ukraine,. Q: For how many deaths there was he basically responsible? A: f over 7 million people. Q: Did the Soviet Union have nuclear weapons? A: yes. Q: How many other states had them? A: four others.

Buckinghamshire is one of the home counties and towns such as High Wycombe, Amersham, Chesham and the Chalfonts in the east and southeast of the county are parts of the London commuter belt, forming some of the most densely-populated parts of the county. Development in this region is restricted by the Metropolitan Green Belt. Other large settlements include the county town of Aylesbury, Marlow in the south near the Thames and Princes Risborough in the west near Oxford. Some areas without direct rail links to London, such as around the old county town of Buckingham and near Olney in the northeast, are much less populous. The largest town is Milton Keynes in the northeast, which with the surrounding area is administered as a unitary authority separately to the rest of Buckinghamshire. The remainder of the county is administered by Buckinghamshire County Council as a non-metropolitan county, and four district councils.

765,"Multimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material. 

Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by information content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance. Multimedia devices are electronic media devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from mixed media in fine art; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. The term ""rich media"" is synonymous with interactive multimedia. 

The term ""multimedia"" was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later 'Bobb Goldsteinn') to promote the July 1966 opening of his ""LightWorks at L'Oursin"" show at Southampton, Long Island. Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called ""intermedia"". 

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of ""Variety"" borrowed the terminology, reporting: ""Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('Washington Square') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest ""multi-media"" music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare."" Two years later, in 1968, the term ""multimedia"" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.

Serge went to Moscow. He entered the Teknik. He became a student. He learned geography from Stoj, the professor, astrography from Fudj, the assistant, together with giliodesy, orgastrophy and other native Russian studies. 

All day he worked. His industry was unflagging. His instructors were enthusiastic. ""If he goes on like this,"" they said, ""he will some day know something."" 

""It is marvellous,"" said one. ""If he continues thus, he will be a professor."" 

""He is too young,"" said Stoj, shaking his head. ""He has too much hair."" 

""He sees too well,"" said Fudj. ""Let him wait till his eyes are weaker."" 

But all day as Serge worked he thought. And his thoughts were of Olga Ileyitch, the girl that he had seen with Kwartz, inspector of police. He wondered why she had killed Popoff, the inspector. He wondered if she was dead. There seemed no justice in it. 

One day he questioned his professor. 

""Is the law just?"" he said. ""Is it right to kill?"" 

But Stoj shook his head, and would not answer. 

""Let us go on with our orgastrophy,"" he said. And he trembled so that the chalk shook in his hand. 

So Serge questioned no further, but he thought more deeply still. All the way from the Teknik to the house where he lodged he was thinking. As he climbed the stair to his attic room he was still thinking. 

The house in which Serge lived was the house of Madame Vasselitch. It was a tall dark house in a sombre street. There were no trees upon the street and no children played there.

6080,"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Michael Jackson had a level of hero worship on a par with Elvis Presley or the Beatles but he was the first black star to inspire such a massive following around the world. 

Michael Jackson, the ultimate showman, craved attention and was rarely disappointed. 

Total worldwide sales of more than 350 million records over his 40-year career give just a hint of the adoration there was for the ""King of Pop."" The fact that his death came on the eve of a comeback tour in London will leave his devotees feeling even more bereft. 

While his career -- and wealth -- had waned greatly in recent years, there was still enough support for the concerts to sell out at a rate of nearly 40,000 an hour. Fans from as far afield as Japan, Germany and Dubai queued to buy their tickets. 

Steve Greenberg, founder and CEO of S-Curve Records, was a disc jockey in Tel Aviv, Israel, when ""Thriller"" first dropped and witnessed first-hand how Jackson became an international icon. 

His was a global appeal, Greenberg said, among fans and artists worldwide. 

""He was as big in the Middle East and Southeast Asia as he was in America and Europe,"" Greenberg said. ""He had that universality that not many people had. The Beatles had it, Muhammad Ali had it, but not many other people have had it."" 

Jackson was known for far more than his music though. Speaking after his death in Los Angeles was announced, U.S. civil rights campaigner Rev. Al Sharpton paid tribute to the work of a ""trailblazer"" in helping people around the world through his charities. How will you remember Michael Jackson?

807,"A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. 

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. 

Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk. 

The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. 

Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians in transplant surgery at the Royal Liverpool. ""Funding is a problem,"" said Hammad. ""In the meantime we'll go back as volunteers to Gaza for the next couple of years to do more transplants."" The Liverpool team's next visit is scheduled for May. Q: What is Adbelkader Hammad's job? A: doctor. Q: Where does he work? A: at the Royal Liverpool hospital. Q: Where is his family from?

4623,"(CNN) -- Pablo Sandoval's record-tying three home runs led the San Francisco Giants to an 8-3 victory over the Detroit Tigers in Game 1 of the World Series. 

Barry Zito gave up just one run in 5 2/3 innings to earn the win for San Francisco. He also had a run-scoring single in the fourth inning. 

Tigers pitching ace Justin Verlander only managed to go four innings, allowing five runs on six hits. 

Sandoval, who had 12 home runs during the regular season, hit a solo home run in the first and a two-run shot in the third off Verlander. In the fifth, he added another home run off Al Alburquerque. He has six home runs in the postseason. 

""In this situation you're going to face the best. For me I just go in there and don't thinking too much or try to do too much, get a pitch you can hit, take advantage of the mistakes he be making. That's a part of my game."" Sandoval said. 

His manager said Sandoval has been swinging the bat well for weeks.

The same source said the U.S. is ""prepared to provide whatever help and support Eman may need."" 

Al-Obeidy grabbed the world's attention this spring when she accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's security forces of gang-raping her. 

She is now on the way to Malta with her father, according to another high-level U.S. State Department source. She will eventually head to a processing center in Europe before leaving for a final destination. 

She has told CNN on repeated occasions that she wants to go to the United States. 

One of the State Department sources told CNN that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ""has been deeply interested in the case and has followed it throughout."" 

Al-Obeidy was in Qatar awaiting resettlement as a refugee when she was deported Thursday and sent back to Libya. She was reportedly beaten before being deported.

She said al-Obeidy had a black eye, bruises on her legs and scratches on her arms.
