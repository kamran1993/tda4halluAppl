Northward, along the leeward coast of Malaita, the _Ariel_ worked her leisurely way, threading the colour-riotous lagoon that lay between the shore-reefs and outer-reefs, daring passages so narrow and coral-patched that Captain Winters averred each day added a thousand grey hairs to his head, and dropping anchor off every walled inlet of the outer reef and every mangrove swamp of the mainland that looked promising of cannibal life. For Harley and Villa Kennan were in no hurry. So long as the way was interesting, they dared not how long it proved from anywhere to anywhere. 

During this time Jerry learned a new name for himself--or, rather, an entire series of names for himself. This was because of an aversion on Harley Kennan's part against renaming a named thing.

5,6,"HOUSTON (AP) --- A 10-year-old boy fatally shot his father Friday, striking him several times as he sat in the front seat of a SUV to pick up the boy from his mother's home for a weekend visit. 

The incident happened about 3pm on a cul-desac in the 1700 block of Cedar Cove Court, said Sgt. Williams of the Harris County Sheriff's Department. 

An investigation found that Rick James Lohstroh, 41, was shot by his son, who was sitting in the back seat of the man's Toyota 4-Runner, said Sgt. Williams. The shooting took place outside the home of Lohstroh's ex-wife, where the boy lives with his mother and a 7-year-old brother. 

""We're not certain of anything until we finish our investigation,"" Williams said. ""The information we have at this time is that the 10-year-old did fire the weapon."" 

The mother and the 7-year-old were inside the house when the shooting occurred, said Williams. 

Williams said the gun belonged to the boy's mother. After firing shots through the back seat, the boy exited the back of the vehicle and continued to fire at the car. 

The man died on the way to Memorial Herman Hospital. 

Lohstroh was a doctor at the University of Texas Medical Branch. 

The man and woman shared custody of the children. 

Williams said the mother and the boy were still in the home talking to investigators Friday night. 

Neighbors described the family as being quiet and keeping to themselves.

WAITING. 

The lengthening sunny days went on without bringing either what Romola most desired or what she most dreaded. They brought no sign from Baldassarre, and, in spite of special watch on the part of the Government, no revelation of the suspected conspiracy. But they brought other things which touched her closely, and bridged the phantom-crowded space of anxiety with active sympathy in immediate trial. They brought the spreading Plague and the Excommunication of Savonarola. 

Both these events tended to arrest her incipient alienation from the Frate, and to rivet again her attachment to the man who had opened to her the new life of duty, and who seemed now to be worsted in the fight for principle against profligacy. For Romola could not carry from day to day into the abodes of pestilence and misery the sublime excitement of a gladness that, since such anguish existed, she too existed to make some of the anguish less bitter, without remembering that she owed this transcendent moral life to Fra Girolamo. She could not witness the silencing and excommunication of a man whose distinction from the great mass of the clergy lay, not in any heretical belief, not in his superstitions, but in the energy with which he sought to make the Christian life a reality, without feeling herself drawn strongly to his side. 

Far on in the hot days of June the Excommunication, for some weeks arrived from Rome, was solemnly published in the Duomo.

8,9,"Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. 

Lugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. 

The president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. 

Brig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. 

The announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. 

Cibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. 

Other changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. 

Paraguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. 

The military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","Asuncion, Paraguay (CNN) -- Paraguay installed new top military commanders, but President Fernando Lugo, who had ordered the change in leadership, was not present for the ceremony. 

Lugo's absence Thursday morning attracted attention given his administration's silence on the sudden change in the leadership of the country's army, air force and navy. 

The president's decision to replace the top brass came a day after he publicly dismissed rumors about a military coup. 

Brig. Gen. Bartolome Ramon Pineda Ortiz was named as the new army commander. Brig. Gen. Hugo Gilberto Aranda Chamorro and Rear Adm. Egberto Emerito Orie Benegas took over the top posts at the air force and navy, respectively. 

The announcement came from the armed forces, not the president's office. 

Cibar Benitez, commander of the armed forces, was the only top leader to retain his post. 

Other changes would be forthcoming in the lower ranks, said Benitez at the swearing-in ceremony, but he denied there was any truth to talk of a coup. 

Paraguay's history is filled with unstable transitions of power since it emerged from dictatorship in 1989. Although there hasn't been a coup since that year, there were attempted coups in 1996 and 2000, and President Raul Cubas resigned amid controversy in 1999. 

The military shakeup is the third since Lugo took office. The former Catholic bishop was elected to a five-year term last year. His victory brought an end to six decades of one-party rule in Paraguay, but the honeymoon did not last long. 

In April, Lugo admitted that he fathered a child while he was still a priest and that he may have fathered more. The revelation, which came as a shock to most, hurt his political image. Calls for his resignation began, and have continued as Lugo has struggled to push reforms through a majority-opposition legislature.",56,train

When Anne Woodford began to wake from the constant thought of the grief and horror she had left at Portchester, and to feel more alive to her surroundings and less as if they were a kind of dream, in which she only mechanically took her part, one thing impressed itself on her gradually, and that was disappointment. If the previous shock had not blunted all her hopes and aspirations, perhaps she would have felt it sooner and more keenly; but she could not help realising that she had put herself into an inferior position whence there did not seem to be the promotion she had once anticipated. Her companion rockers were of an inferior grade to herself. Jane Humphreys was a harmless but silly girl, not much wiser, though less spoilt, than poor little Madam, and full of Cockney vulgarities. Education was unfashionable just then, and though Hester Bridgeman was bettor born and bred, being the daughter of an attorney in the city, she was not much better instructed, and had no pursuits except that of her own advantage. Pauline Dunord was by far the best of the three, but she seemed to live a life apart, taking very little interest in her companions or anything around her except her devotions and the bringing them over to her Church. The nursery was quite a separate establishment; there was no mingling with the guests of royalty, who were only seen in excited peeps from the window, or when solemnly introduced to the presence chamber to pay their respects to the Prince. As to books, the only secular one that Anne saw while at Whitehall was an odd volume of Parthenissa. The late King's summary of the Roman controversy was to be had in plenty, and nothing was more evident than that the only road to favour or promotion was in being thereby convinced.

At once a crowd of performers surrounded the pair. Very few of them liked Jack Snipper, and they wondered what Leo would do should the gymnast attack the boy. 

“Call me a braggart, will you!” roared Snipper. 

“Don’t you dare to touch me with that club!” replied Leo calmly. 

“I’ll teach you a lesson!” 

And, swinging the Indian club over his head, Jack Snipper made a savage blow at the young gymnast. 

Had the stick struck Leo the boy’s head would have sustained a severe injury. 

But as quick as a flash Leo dodged, and the Indian club merely circled through the empty air. 

“For shame, Snipper!” 

“Do you want to kill the boy?” 

“What harm has he done?” 

And so the cries ran on. 

“Mind your own affairs!” shouted the maddened gymnast. “I’m going to teach the boy a lesson!” 

Again he sprang at Leo. 

But now suddenly the Indian club was caught. A dexterous twist, and it went flying out of reach across the dressing tent. 

Then, before Snipper could recover, he received a stinging slap full in the face that sent him staggering backward on the grass. 

A shout of approval went up. 

“Good for Leo!” 

“That’s right, boy, stand up for your rights!”

23,25,"CHAPTER III. THE ROMAN BARONS 

Having driven Charles VIII out of Italy, it still remained for the allies to remove all traces of his passage from Naples and to restore the rule of the House of Aragon. In this they had the aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, who sent an army under the command of that distinguished soldier Gonzalo de Cordoba, known in his day as the Great Captain. 

He landed in Calabria in the spring of 1496, and war broke out afresh through that already sorely devastated land. The Spaniards were joined by the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","CHAPTER III. THE ROMAN BARONS 

Having driven Charles VIII out of Italy, it still remained for the allies to remove all traces of his passage from Naples and to restore the rule of the House of Aragon. In this they had the aid of Ferdinand and Isabella, who sent an army under the command of that distinguished soldier Gonzalo de Cordoba, known in his day as the Great Captain. 

He landed in Calabria in the spring of 1496, and war broke out afresh through that already sorely devastated land. The Spaniards were joined by the allied forces of Venice and the Church under the condotta of the Marquis Gonzaga of Mantua, the leader of the Italians at Fornovo. 

Lodovico had detached himself from the league, and again made terms with France for his own safety's sake.

24,26,"(CNN) -- Before she was a princess, she was a child - shy but affectionate, respectful but mischievous. 

Diana Spencer, shown on her first birthday, grew up at Park House, a country estate leased from the royal family. 

Ten years after the death of Princess Diana, two women who helped raise the future princess are providing a new, intimate portrait of the girl who would become the ""People's Princess."" 

Diana Frances Spencer was born into a life of privilege. She grew up at Park House, a country home leased from the royal family's Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. Her parents, Johnnie and Frances Spencer, were well-known members of the English aristocracy. 

Inge Crane came to Park House as an au pair when Diana was just 3 years old. 

""There's always been something special about Park House. It's difficult to put a finger on what it is,"" she said in her first interview, given exclusively to CNN. 

Life at the house wasn't entirely normal -- the queen's estate was about a mile away, and the young Princes Andrew and Edward (Diana's future in-laws) frequently visited to swim in the pool. 

When the butler would ring the gong for dinner, the children would rush to the stairs, slide down the wooden banister and run into the dining room.

Ryan Reynolds wonders if marrying his boss, Sandra Bullock, is a good thing in ""The Proposal."" 

Something old: The story of a haughty woman and an exasperated man who hate each other -- until they realize they love each other -- is proudly square, in the tradition of rom-coms from the 1940s and '50s. Or is it straight out of Shakespeare's 1590s? 

Sandra Bullock is the shrew, Margaret, a pitiless, high-powered New York book editor first seen multitasking in the midst of her aerobic workout (thus you know she needs to get ... loved). Ryan Reynolds is Andrew, her put-upon foil of an executive assistant, a younger man who accepts abuse as a media-industry hazing ritual. 

And there the two would remain, locked in mutual disdain, except for Margaret's fatal flaw -- she's Canadian. (So is ""X-Men's"" Wolverine; I thought our neighbors to the north were supposed to be nice.) 

Margaret, with her visa expired, faces deportation and makes the snap executive decision to marry Andrew in a green-card wedding. It's an offer the underling can't refuse if he wants to keep his job. (A sexual-harassment lawsuit would ruin the movie's mood.) 

OK, he says. But first comes a visit to the groom-to-be's family in Alaska. Amusing complications ensue.

30,32,"A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. 

The international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball. 

In the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","A One Day International (ODI) is a form of limited overs cricket, played between two teams with international status, in which each team faces a fixed number of overs, usually 50. The Cricket World Cup is played in this format. One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. 

The international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The layout of Spain's provinces closely follows the pattern of the territorial division of the country carried out in 1833. The only major change of provincial borders since that time has been the sub-division of the Canary Islands into two provinces rather than one. 

Historically, the provinces served mainly as transmission belts for policies enacted in Madrid, as Spain was a highly centralised state for most of its history. The importance of the provinces has declined since the adoption of the system of autonomous communities in the period of the Spanish transition to democracy. They nevertheless remain electoral districts for national elections and as geographical references: for instance in postal addresses and telephone codes.

Five minutes after Paula had left him, punctual to the second, the four telegrams disposed of, Dick was getting into a ranch motor car, along with Thayer, the Idaho buyer, and Naismith, the special correspondent for the _Breeders' Gazette_.

There was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation.

Five minutes after Paula had left him, punctual to the second, the four telegrams disposed of, Dick was getting into a ranch motor car, along with Thayer, the Idaho buyer, and Naismith, the special correspondent for the _Breeders' Gazette_. Wardman, the sheep manager, joined them at the corrals where several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection. 

There was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation.

39,42,"(CNN) -- Three Pakistani cricketers found guilty of corruption pleaded for leniency on Wednesday ahead of their sentencing in a British court. 

Former national captain Salman Butt and bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir will discover their fate on Thursday, along with agent Mazhar Majeed. 

Majeed, like Amir, pleaded guilty after being caught accepting money from an undercover newspaper reporter to ""spot-fix"" outcomes during a Test match against England at Lord's in August 2010. 

Butt and Asif unsuccessfully tried to overturn charges that they both conspired to cheat and accept corrupt funds from Majeed, having been accused of agreeing to deliver three no-ball deliveries at specified times during the match. 

Former Pakistan captain blames ICC for corruption in cricket 

Majeed testified that he gave Asif £65,000 ($103,000) and also paid £10,000 ($16,000) to Butt and £2,500 ($4,000) to Amir after receiving £150,000 ($240,000) from a journalist working for the now defunct News of the World paper. 

The cheating charge carries a maximum sentence of two years plus an unlimited fine, while they could be jailed for seven years with an unlimited fine for accepting corrupt payments. 

Amir, a rising star in the sport at the age of 19, outlined his remorse in a statement read by his lawyer. 

""First I want to apologize to Pakistan and to everyone that cricket is important to,"" he said. ""I do know how much damage this has done to the game, a game which I love more than anything else in the world. 

""I did decide many months ago that I wanted to admit that I deliberately threw two no-balls at the Lord's Test last summer. But I know this was very late and I want to apologize for not saying it before. I didn't find the courage to do it at the beginning, and I know very well that made everything much more difficult.""

But last October,ChiChi proved to be more than just a pretty face. Mary and her husband,Rick,were relaxing on the beach one afternoon while on vacation in North Carolina's Outer Banks.As usual,ChiChi was lying on his blanket in his own little beach chair. 

""We had our noses buried in books,""recalls Rick,""when suddenly the dog became extremely uneasy. His bark was different from anything we had heard before.And he would not let us ignore him."" 

ChiChi ran back and forth in front of his chair as if to run down the beach.The Lanes sat up to see two elderly women in the ocean,about 100 yards down the beach and 10 feet off shore.One was on her back,her head under the waves.The other was struggling hard to keep her friend's head above the surface. 

The Lanes rushed across the sand and into the surf. Rick went to the woman in danger of drowning,while Mary held fast on to the other one and pulled her up on the beach.""Then I went back to help Rick,"" Mary says.""The sand dropped off steeply,and a riptide was beating the woman under. She was completely helpless."" 

Not getting well from recent knee surgery,the woman had been unable to turn over or push herself up.""Her friend had been in danger too,"" Mary says.""The waves were pushing her around. There's no way she could have held on much longer."" 

The women hadn't called out for help. ""They were struggling so hard that there was no time for screaming,"" Mary recalls.""But ChiChi had sensed their danger."" 

Duty done,ChiChi was back in his chair,asleep,by the time the two women were on dry ground and the Lanes had returned to their blankets.Luckily,the women were fine,though shaken.They thanked the Lanes for saving their lives.

48,51,"(CNN) -- Chelsea's star striker Didier Drogba has been suffering from malaria, his club manager revealed on Tuesday, but the Ivory Coast player will still line up for the London derby against Fulham in the English Premier League on Wednesday. 

Drogba started on the bench for Chelsea's 2-0 defeat to Liverpool on Sunday, having missed recent matches against Aston Villa and Spartak Moscow due to a suspected virus. 

However, the results of blood tests showed that he had in fact contracted the tropical disease. 

""A test showed malaria,"" Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti told his club's official website. ""He lost his condition, he lost power. 

""Didier had a difficulty to train because he didn't feel good, he didn't have power to train. He was unselfish to play also when he was not 100 percent."" 

But the Italian said Drogba was now back to health and would be fit for the league leaders' home clash with Fulham on Wednesday. 

""He suffered obviously but after treatment, he will be better,"" Ancelotti said. ""One time it was serious, now there is the possibility to treat and come back well. He is okay. Tomorrow he will play."" 

Ancelotti said Ghana midfielder Michael Essien would return to the Chelsea line-up, having missed the Liverpool game with a toe problem, but Frank Lampard is not yet ready to make his long-awaited return. 

The England midfielder, who has been sidelined following a hernia operation, is scheduled to make his comeback against Sunderland on Sunday.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","I shall never forget the night, a few years ago, when Marion J. Douglas was a student in one of my calsses. (I have not used his real name for personal reasons. As he requested.) But here is his real story as he told it before one of our adult - education classes. He told us how tragedy had struck at his home, not once, but twice. The first time he had lost his five-old daughter, a child he adored. He and his wife thought they couldn't bear that first loss; but, as he said:""Ten months later, God gave us another little girl and she died in five days."" 

This double 

was almost too much to bear. ""I couldn't take it,"" this father told us. ""I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat, I couldn't rest or relax. My nerves were entirely shaken and my confidence gone."" At last he went to doctors; one recommended sleeping pills and another recommended a trip. He tried both, but neither helped. He said:""My body felt as if it was surrounded in a vice , and the jaws of the vice were being drawn tighter and tighter."" The tension of grief ----if you have ever been paralyzed by sorrow, you know what he meant. 

But thank God, I had one child left ----a four --year-- old son. He gave me the solution to my problem. One afternoon as I sat around feeling sorry for myself, he asked; 'Daddy, will you build a boat for me?' I was in no mood to build a boat; in fact, I was in no mood to do anything. But my son is a persistent little fellow! I had to give in. 

Building that toy boat took me about three hours. By the time it was finished, I realized that those three hours spent building that boat were first hours of mental relaxation and peace that I had had in months! I realized that it is difficult to worry while you are busy doing something that requires planning and thinking. In my case, building the boat had knocked worry out of the ring. So I determined to keep busy. 

The following night, I went from room to room in the house, making a list of jobs that ought to be done. Scores of items needed to be repaired: bookcase, stair steps, storm windows, window-shades, locks, leaky taps. Amazing as it seems, in the course of two weeks I had made a list of 242 items that needed attention. 

""During the last two years I have completed most of them. I am busy now that I have no time for worry."" 

No time for worry! That is exactly what Winston Churchill said when he was working eighteen hours a day at the height of the war. When he was asked if he worried about his huge responsibilities, he said :""I am too busy. I have no time for worry.""",140,train

55,60,"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki began her latest bid for a first grand slam title with a 6-2 6-1 win over Anastasia Rodionova on Monday, joining last year's finalists Kim Clijsters and Li Na in the second round of the Australian Open. 

Top seed Wozniacki looked in good shape as she wrapped up victory against the Russia-born Australian in 76 minutes, but the Dane admitted she was worried about a wrist injury she suffered during last week's quarterfinal defeat at the Sydney International. 

""I was a bit nervous before the match. I didn't know exactly what to expect. But it feels better,"" the 21-year-old told the WTA Tour website. ""I'm very happy about the way I felt out there today. I got into the rhythm as the match went on tonight.""

THE FITZGERALDS OF CASTLE RICHMOND. 

What idea of carrying out his plans may have been prevalent in Fitzgerald's mind when he was so defiant of the countess, it may be difficult to say. Probably he had no idea, but felt at the spur of the moment that it would be weak to yield. The consequence was, that when Lady Desmond left Hap House, he was obliged to consider himself as being at feud with the family. 

The young lord he did see once again during the holidays, and even entertained him at Hap House; but the earl's pride would not give way an inch. 

""Much as I like you, Owen, I cannot do anything but oppose it. It would be a bad match for my sister, and so you'd feel if you were in my place."" And then Lord Desmond went back to Eton. 

After that they none of them met for many months. During this time life went on in a very triste manner at Desmond Court. Lady Desmond felt that she had done her duty by her daughter; but her tenderness to Clara was not increased by the fact that her foolish attachment had driven Fitzgerald from the place. As for Clara herself, she not only kept her word, but rigidly resolved to keep it. Twice she returned unopened, and without a word of notice, letters which Owen had caused to be conveyed to her hand.

It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the ""Chicago Tribune""s parent company purchased the ""Los Angeles Times""). 

Traditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the ""Tribune"" announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the ""Tribune"" discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels. 

The ""Tribune""s masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, ""An American Paper for Americans."" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag. 

The ""Tribune"" was founded by James Kelly, John E. Wheeler, and Joseph K. C. Forrest, publishing the first edition on June 10, 1847. Numerous changes in ownership and editorship took place over the next eight years. Initially, the ""Tribune"" was not politically affiliated, but tended to support either the Whig or Free Soil parties against the Democrats in elections. By late 1853, it was frequently running xenophobic editorials that criticized foreigners and Roman Catholics. About this time it also became a strong proponent of temperance.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","There once was a big black and white dog named Forrest. His owner's name was Jeff. Jeff thought he was the best dog in the whole world. 

One night, when Forrest and Jeff were taking a walk in the park, they saw two men walking down the path. Both men were dressed in very nice suits. 

Jeff waved at the men. 

""Good evening,"" he said. ""How are you tonight?"" 

""Hello,"" one of the men said. ""It is such a great night for walking."" 

Jeff and Forrest kept walking down the path. It was a very dark night, but the moon was shining bright. When Jeff turned around to look for the two men, he could not see them at all. They were nowhere to be seen. 

Later that night, when their walk was over, Jeff and Forrest were lying on the bed. They were watching a television show about ghosts. 

""Do you think maybe those two men were ghosts?"" Jeff said out loud. ""They did not leave a trace."" 

Forrest was a dog, but he acted like he understood. He barked. 

Jeff smiled. He liked that his dog always saw things the same way he did. ",226,train
62,67,"The Mongol Empire (Mongolian: ""Mongolyn Ezent Güren"" ; Mongolian Cyrillic: Монголын эзэнт гүрэн; ; also (""Horde"") in Russian chronicles) existed during the 13th and 14th centuries and was the largest contiguous land empire in history. Originating in the steppes of Central Asia, the Mongol Empire eventually stretched from Eastern Europe to the Sea of Japan, extending northwards into Siberia, eastwards and southwards into the Indian subcontinent, Indochina, and the Iranian plateau, and westwards as far as the Levant. 

The Mongol Empire emerged from the unification of nomadic tribes in the Mongol homeland under the leadership of Genghis Khan, whom a council proclaimed ruler of all the Mongols in 1206. The empire grew rapidly under his rule and that of his descendants, who sent invasions in every direction. The vast transcontinental empire connected the east with the west with an enforced ""Pax Mongolica"", allowing the dissemination and exchange of trade, technologies, commodities, and ideologies across Eurasia. 

The empire began to split due to wars over succession, as the grandchildren of Genghis Khan disputed whether the royal line should follow from his son and initial heir Ögedei or from one of his other sons, such as Tolui, Chagatai, or Jochi. The Toluids prevailed after a bloody purge of Ögedeid and Chagataid factions, but disputes continued even among the descendants of Tolui. A key reason for the split was the dispute over whether the Mongol Empire would become a sedentary, cosmopolitan empire, or would stay true to their nomadic and steppe lifestyle. After Möngke Khan died (1259), rival kurultai councils simultaneously elected different successors, the brothers Ariq Böke and Kublai Khan, who then not only fought each other in the Toluid Civil War (1260–1264), but also dealt with challenges from descendants of other sons of Genghis. Kublai successfully took power, but civil war ensued as Kublai sought unsuccessfully to regain control of the Chagatayid and Ögedeid families. Q: When did Genghis Khan become ruler of Mongol? A: 1206. Q: Did his empire grow when he and his family ruled? A: Yes. Q: What allowed trade with the east and west?

Alice put it in the newspaper, admitting that though she liked it, she didn't know where it came from or what it really meant.

""I thought it was beautiful,"" she said, explaining why she'd taken to writing it at the bottom of all her letters, ""like a message from above."" Her husband, Frank, liked the phrase so much that he put it up on the classroom wall for his students, one of whom was the daughter of Alice Johnson, a local news reporter. Alice put it in the newspaper, admitting that though she liked it, she didn't know where it came from or what it really meant. 

Two days later, Alice got a call from Anne Herbert, a woman living in Marin. It was in a restaurant that Anne wrote the phrase down on a piece of paper, after turning it around in her mind for days. 

""Here's the idea,"" Anne says. ""Anything you think there should be more of, do it randomly."" Her fantasies include painting the classrooms of shabby schools, leaving hot meals on kitchen tables in the poor part of town, and giving money secretly to a proud old lady. Anne says, "" _ ."" 

The acts of random kindness spread. If you were one of those drivers who found your fare paid, who knows what you might have been inspired to do for someone else later. Like all great events, kindness begins slowly, with every single act. Let it be yours! ",143,train

71,77,"Louisiana is a state located in the Southern United States. Louisiana is the 31st most extensive and the 25th most populous of the 50 United States. Its capital is Baton Rouge and largest city is New Orleans. Louisiana is the only state in the U.S. with political subdivisions termed parishes, which are the local government's equivalent to counties. The largest parish by population is East Baton Rouge Parish, and the largest by total area is Plaquemines. Louisiana is bordered by Arkansas to the north, Mississippi to the east, Texas to the west, and the Gulf of Mexico to the south. 

Much of the state's lands were formed from sediment washed down the Mississippi River, leaving enormous deltas and vast areas of coastal marsh and swamp. These contain a rich southern biota; typical examples include birds such as ibis and egrets. There are also many species of tree frogs, and fish such as sturgeon and paddlefish. In more elevated areas, fire is a natural process in the landscape, and has produced extensive areas of longleaf pine forest and wet savannas. These support an exceptionally large number of plant species, including many species of orchids and carnivorous plants. Louisiana has more Native American tribes than any other southern state, including four that are federally recognized, ten that are state recognized, and four that have not yet received recognition.

72,78,"Climate is the statistics of weather over long periods of time. It is measured by assessing the patterns of variation in temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, precipitation, atmospheric particle count and other meteorological variables in a given region over long periods of time. Climate differs from weather, in that weather only describes the short-term conditions of these variables in a given region. 

A region's climate is generated by the climate system, which has five components: atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. 

The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents. Climates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. 

Paleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since direct observations of climate are not available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, ""a 3°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones"". Q: Were direct observations of the climate around before the 19th century? A: No. Q: What is paleocimatology? A: The study of ancient climates.",What are those climates called?,"['Paleoclimates.', 'paleoclimates', 'paleoclimates', 'paleoclimates']",336yqze83vet37vakvnt4i8m5645mz_2,True,Inferred from proxy variables.,"You will be provided with a passage followed by a series of questions and answers based on the passage.

Forester and Marco did not take breakfast on board the steamboat, but waited until they got on shore. They had inquired of a fellow-passenger, who seemed acquainted with the country, and were told that there was a very good tavern about a quarter of a mile from the mill. 

When they landed upon the logs, Marco, whose curiosity seemed to be stronger than his appetite, wanted to ramble about for a little time along the shore and among the piles of boards, but Forester thought it would be best first to go and get their breakfast. 

""Because,"" said he, ""we can then amuse ourselves by rambling about here, and shall be ready to return to the steamboat whenever they send for us."" 

So they went to the tavern. 

Forester seemed to have little appetite for his breakfast. He complained of feeling fatigued, and yet he had nothing to fatigue him. Marco ate, and talked fast all the time; but Forester seemed silent and dejected.

Forester said that he felt somewhat unwell, and as there was a sofa in the room, he concluded to lie down upon it, and not go out. Marco was, at first, disposed to stay and take care of him, but Forester said that he did not need anything, and he wished Marco to go out and amuse himself.

82,89,"Sydney (CNN) -- Kevin Rudd and Tony Abbott, the two men vying to be Australia's prime minister in the September 7 national election, offer contrasting views on China, the country that looms largest on Australia's economic and strategic horizon. 

Rudd, the Chinese-speaking incumbent prime minister in the Labor-led government, says the China resources boom is over and Australia needs to prepare for that transition, given how important China has become as a trade partner in the past decade. 

China is a key destination for Australian resources such as iron ore, coal and LNG. But in recent months, even China's breakneck economic pace has hit some speed bumps. 

On the broader geopolitical front, Rudd wants China and the United States to carve out a new Asia-Pacific ""strategic road-map"" that will enhance trade, investment and security in the region.

The Opposition's view on China 

Abbott, who has led the opposition Liberal Party since 2009, wants the Australia-China relationship to move from one based on shared interests to one of ""shared values."" 

But he notes that Australia's friendship with China is more recent than that with Japan, and less developed than that with the United States. 

In a major policy speech to a business audience in Beijing last year, Abbott said he believed it would take time before Australia's ties with China approached ""the warmth that we take for granted with America."" Still, he believes it is an effort worth making. 

Like his mentor, former Australian prime minister John Howard, Abbott is a rock-solid supporter of Australia's military alliance with the United States, and believes that it is possible to be friends both with Washington and Beijing. Howard, he said, ""understood that you could make a new friend without losing an old one.""  Q: Who has led the Liberal Party? A: Tony Abbott. Q: Who is he running against? A: Kevin Rudd. Q: What language does Rudd speak? A: Chinese. Q: Why is China important to Australia? A: China is a key destination for Australian resources. Q: What does Rudd want China and the United States to do?

84,91,"(CNN) -- Manchester City thrashed Sunderland 5-0 to keep alive their slim English Premier League title hopes and to cement their position in the top four Champions League places. 

England international Adam Johnson, making his first start since injuring his ankle in January, opened the scoring in the ninth minute while captain Carlos Tevez doubled the Blues' advantage on the quarter hour from the penalty spot. 

Second-half strikes from David Silva, Patrick Vieira and Yaya Toure completed the rout as City went above reigning champions Chelsea into third in the standings. 

They are six points clear of fifth-placed Tottenham, who pipped them for the final Champions League place last season, but have played a game more. 

Leaders Manchester United have a seven-point lead over Arsenal, who have played a game less, with their neighbors City 10 points adrift. 

The strikes from Johnson, who exchanged passes with Toure before finishing neatly, and Tevez, who was fouled by Michael Turner to draw the penalty, effectively ended the match as a contest with City always in command against a Sunderland side in poor recent form. 

Silva scored after a Mario Balotelli shot was blocked, Vieira with his first touch after coming off the bench and Toure after an error by Sunderland captain Lee Cattermole. 

City's Dutch international Nigel de Jong said the result was important for their Champions League ambitions.

Muntadhar al-Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush. He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued. 

However, he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison. 

""I got my chance, and I didn't miss it,"" he said. 

""I am not a hero, and I admit that,"" he added. ""I am a person with a stance. I saw my country burning."" 

Al-Zaidi, who was serving a one-year sentence after the jail-throwing incident December 14, was given a ""conditional discharge."" 

Under Iraqi law, a ""conditional discharge"" allows for the release of a prisoner after he serves three-quarters of his sentence, on good behavior. Watch more about al-Zaidi's release »",57,test

First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup. Delicious! I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade. 

I sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig. But today there were only a few flamingos. I opened up the book I was reading, ""All About Birds."" I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins. 

While putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck. I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! I had never seen one so close to my face. 

""Er, what's up?"" I asked. 

""Not much,"" he said. ""I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."" 

""Sure, little guy,"" I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","One morning, I woke up and went downstairs for breakfast. I fixed my normal breakfast: hot pickles, marshmallows, and ketchup. First I heat up the pickles on the stove, then I put the marshmallows in the toaster as I pour out my small plate of ketchup. Delicious! I eat it every morning, often with a tall glass of lemonade. 

I sat down at the table to eat, and looked out the window at the birds in my yard. Sometimes I see skunks outside, and once I saw a small pot-bellied pig. But today there were only a few flamingos. I opened up the book I was reading, ""All About Birds."" I had finished the chapter on pigeons, and was moving on to robins. 

While putting ketchup on my marshmallows, I felt something tickling my neck. I looked down, and there was a daddy long-legs, climbing up! I had never seen one so close to my face. 

""Er, what's up?"" I asked. 

""Not much,"" he said. ""I smelled the hot pickles, and wanted to have a taste."" 

""Sure, little guy,"" I said. I put a small piece of pickle on my finger and held it out. While I was doing that, that sneaky daddy-long-legs ran down my arm. He grabbed the rest of my pickle, and ran out the door! And that was the last time I gave a pickle to a spider at breakfast. ",182,train

THE VISIT TO MARY ERSKINE'S. 

Malleville and Phonny arrived at Mary Erskine's about an hour after Beechnut left them. They met with no special adventures by the way, except that when they reached the great pine-tree, Phonny proposed to climb up, for the purpose of examining a small bunch which he saw upon one of the branches, which he thought was a bird's nest. It was the same pine-tree that marked the place at which a road branched off into the woods, where Mary Bell had lost her way, several years before. Malleville was very unwilling to have Phonny climb up upon such a high tree, but Phonny himself was very desirous to make the attempt. There was a log fence at the foot of the tree, and the distance was not very great from the uppermost log of the fence, to the lowermost branch of the tree. So Phonny thought that he could get up without any difficulty. 

Malleville was afraid to have him try, and she said that if he did, he would be acting just as foolish as the boy that Beechnut had told them about, who nipped his own nose; and that she should not stop to see him do any such foolishness. So she walked along as fast as she could go. 

Phonny unfortunately was rendered only the more determined to climb the tree by Malleville's opposition. He accordingly mounted up to the top of the fence, and thence reaching the lower branches of the tree he succeeded at length, by dint of much scrambling and struggling, in lifting himself up among them. He climbed out to the limb where he had seen the appearances of a bird's nest, but found to his disappointment that there was no bird's nest there. The bunch was only a little tuft of twigs growing out together.  Q: What is so special about the pine-tree? A: It contained a possible bird's nest. Q: What was the bird's nest?

It was in that park where, according to Meyers' husband, she used to talk to the young man, where she implored him to act like an adult. 

On Thursday, Nowsch was arrested, accused of killing Meyers in what has been described as a road rage incident that ended a week ago with a shooting in front of Meyers' home. 

""We know this boy. I couldn't tell you this before,"" Robert Meyers told reporters after the arrest. ""He knew where I lived. We knew how bad he was, but we didn't know it was this bad. That he'd gotten to this point, and his friends."" 

Nowsch, 19, faces three felony charges: murder, attempted murder and unlawful discharge of a gun from a vehicle. A Monday morning court hearing has been scheduled. 

Robert Meyers said his wife tried to help Nowsch.

103,112,"(CNN) -- Smart, successful, funny and handsome. Robin Williams seemed to have it all. And yet, today he is dead. Apparently, by his own choice. 

But why? What went wrong? 

The joy, spontaneity and humor of Robin Williams likely masked the daily torment he endured in his on-again-off-again struggle with depression. He made us laugh out here, but he was in pain in there. Unfortunately, I know that pain. 

In his death, we have lost one of the most talented and creative spirits on the planet. Still, his death by suicide should be a wake-up call for us all. It is to remind us that many of us are walking a fine line -- smiling on the outside while slowly dying on the inside. 

I didn't know Robin personally, so I am unable to speak with any certainty as to why he chose to end his life. But I have experienced that kind of torment and pain. For years, I, too, struggled with depression. And many days, I still do.

110,119,"Strabo (; ""Strabōn""; 64 or 63 BC) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. 

Strabo was born to an affluent family from Amaseia in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey), a city that he said was situated the approximate equivalent of 75 km from the Black Sea. Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates VI of Pontus. 

Strabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). He moved to Rome in 44 BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31 BC. In 29 BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","Strabo (; ""Strabōn""; 64 or 63 BC) was a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian who lived in Asia Minor during the transitional period of the Roman Republic into the Roman Empire. 

Strabo was born to an affluent family from Amaseia in Pontus (modern Amasya, Turkey), a city that he said was situated the approximate equivalent of 75 km from the Black Sea. Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates VI of Pontus. 

Strabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). He moved to Rome in 44 BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31 BC. In 29 BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea. Around 25 BC, he sailed up the Nile until reaching Philae, after which point there is little record of his proceedings until AD 17.",204,test

115,125,"A new study suggests that early exposure to germs strengthens the immune system. That means letting children get a little dirty might be good for their health later in life. 

The study involved laboratory mice. It found that adult mice raised in a germ-free environment were more likely to develop allergies, asthma and other autoimmune disorders. There are more than eighty disorders where cells that normally defend the body instead attack tissues and organs. 

Richard Blumberg,who led the study,is a professor at Harvard Medical School in Boston,Massachusetts. He says,in 1989,medical researchers who sought to explain these diseases, first discovered that the increasing use of antibacterial soaps and other products, especially early in life, could weaken immune systems. 

Now, Dr. Blumberg and his team have what is the first biological evidence to link early exposure to germs to stronger adult immune systems. They say this exposure could prevent the development of some autoimmune diseases. 

In the adult germ-free mice, they found that inflammation in the lungs and colon was caused by so-called killer T cells. These normally fight infection. But they became overactive and targeted healthy tissue--an autoimmune condition seen in asthma and a disease called ulcerative colitis . 

Dr. Blumberg says the mice raised in a normal environment did not have the same reaction. He says their immune systems had been ""educated"" by early exposure to germs. 

Rates of autoimmune disorders are rising worldwide, but mostly in wealthier, industrialized countries. According to Dr. Blumberg, it might be high time that people were warned to be more careful with the early use of antibiotics and the prescription from their doctors. 

Rob Dunn is a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at North Carolina State University in Raleigh. He says the new study does not mean people should stop washing.

117,127,"(CNN) -- A man who lost both legs in the Boston Marathon attack is engaged to the woman he was waiting for at the finish line. 

Jeff Bauman, 28, is also expected a child this summer with fiancee Erin Hurley, 27, according to an announcement on his foundation's Facebook page: 

""We are so happy to share with you exciting news that has happened over the last few months...Jeff and Erin became engaged and are expecting their first child in the summer!!! Congratulations Jeff and Erin!!"" 

The posting did not reveal a due date for the child or a wedding date. 

Bauman is credited with helping investigators identify the suspects in the April 15, 2013, double bombing. 

The image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. 

A day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. 

Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. 

Bauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled ""Stronger"" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. 

""The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals,"" he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.

The image of the maimed Bauman being led to safety by a man in a cowboy hat became one of the most memorable images of the Boston Marathon terrorist attack that killed three and injured more than 260 people. 

A day after he woke up from two life-saving surgeries with no legs, he mustered the strength to describe bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev to law enforcement. 

Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, has pleaded not guilty to 30 federal charges related the bombings, including murder. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed when his brother ran over him as police were trying to handcuff him in a chase a few days later, authorities said. 

Bauman announced in September that he will publish a memoir -- titled ""Stronger"" -- about his experiences at and since the marathon. 

""The past months have often been difficult, but the support I've received from around the world, and especially from the people of Boston, has inspired me to set and achieve high goals,"" he said in a statement released by Grand Central Publishing last year.",9,train

119,129,"When I was young, I went looking for gold in California. I never found enough to make a rich strike. But I did discover a beautiful part of the country called Stanislau. Like Heaven on Earth, it had bright green hills and deep forests where soft winds touched the trees. By the time I arrived, the charming paradise had been deserted because miners' good luck didn't last. 

Then, I realized I was not alone after all. 

A man was smiling at me as he stood in front of his little house. Its front yard was full of blue and yellow flowers. White curtains hung from the windows and floated in the soft summer wind. 

Still smiling, the man invited me inside. My spirit seemed to come to life again. I saw a bright rug on the shining wooden floor. And on little tables there were seashells, books and china vases full of flowers. A woman had made this house into a home. The joy in my heart showed on my face. The man read my thoughts. ""All her work."" He said affectionately, ""Nothing here hasn't felt the touch of her hand."" 

One picture on the wall was not hanging straight. He went to fix it. He stepped back several times to make sure the picture was straight. Then he gave it a gentle touch. ""She always does that,"" he explained, ""It is like the finishing pat a mother gives her child's hair after she has brushed it. I don't know why I do it. I just do it."" 

As he talked, I went to a little black-walnut shelf that held a small picture of the most beautiful creature I had ever seen. There was a sweetness and softness in the woman's expression. The man stared at the picture. ""Nineteen her last birthday. That was the day we married. When you see her...ah, just wait until you meet her!"" ""Where is she now?"" I asked. ""Oh, she is away visiting her parents. This is Wednesday,"" he said slowly. ""She will be back on Saturday, in the evening."" 

That night, I stayed. The man told me his name was Henry. 

Thursday evening we had two visitors, Tom and Joe. ""We just drop over to ask when little madam is coming home. Any news from her?"" ""Oh yes,"" the man replied. ""A letter."" He took a yellowed letter out of his wallet and read it. It was full of loving messages. While reading, he glimpsed his friends and cried out, ""Oh no, you are doing it again, Tom! Take your hands away and let me see your eyes. I'm going to tell her this time!"" ""No, you mustn't do that, Henry,"" the grey-haired miner said. ""I am getting old. And any little sorrow makes me cry. Lord, we miss her so."" 

Saturday finally came. 

I was glad to see his two friends, Tom and Joe, with guitars, coming down the road as the sun began to set. They put the flowers they brought in vases and began to play some fast and lively songs. 

Henry's friends kept giving him glasses of whiskey. When I reached for one of the two remaining glasses, Tom stopped my arm. ""Drop that! Take the other."" he whispered. I did so. Henry was served last. He had hardly swallowed his drink when the clock struck midnight. His face grew paler and paler. ""Boys,"" he said, ""I am sick with fear. Help! I want to lie down."" Henry was asleep almost before the words were out of his mouth. 

In a moment, those handy men had his clothes off and tucked him into his bed. They seemed to be getting ready to leave. So I said, ""Please don't go, gentlemen. She won't know me. I am a stranger."" They glanced at each other. Then Joe said, ""She? Poor thing, she's been dead nineteen years!"" ""Dead?"" I whispered. ""That or worse."" he said. 

""She went to see her folks half a year after she got married. On her way back, on a Saturday evening in June, when she was almost here, the Indians captured her. She's never been heard of since. Henry _ . He thinks she is still alive. When June comes, he thinks she has gone on her trip to see her parents. Then he begins to wait for her to come back. We drop in here, three days before she's due, to encourage him up and listen to him read the letter. On Saturday we all come and get everything ready for a dance. We've done it for nineteen years.

THE CHARLATAN UNMASKED 

There seemed for the next few minutes to be a somewhat singular abstention from any desire to interfere with the two people who stood in the centre of the little group, hand-in-hand. Saton, after his first speech, and after Lois had given him her hands, had turned a little defiantly toward Rochester, who remained, however, unmoved, his elbow resting upon the broad mantelpiece, his face almost expressionless. Vandermere, too, stood on one side and held his peace, though the effort with which he did so was a visible one. Lady Mary looked anxiously towards them. Pauline had shrunk back, as though something in the situation terrified her. 

Even Saton himself felt that it was the silence before the storm. The courage which he had summoned up to meet a storm of disapproval, began to ebb slowly away in the face of this unnatural silence. It was clear that the onus of further speech was to rest with him. 

Still retaining Lois' hand, he turned toward Rochester. 

""You have forbidden me to enter your house, or to hold any communication with your ward until she was of age, Mr. Rochester,"" he said. ""One of your conditions I have obeyed. With regard to the other, I have done as I thought fit. However, to-day she is her own mistress. She has consented to be my wife. I do not need to ask for your consent or approval.

""I don't see how you are goin' to make it."" 

""Oh, we must get back,"" said Dick. ""If only we could find Tom,"" he added, with a sigh. 

It was fully an hour after they had left the campfire at the entrance to the cave of the mountain. They had walked to the chasm where they thought Tom might have had a tumble and crossed and recrossed it several times. But they had found no traces of the missing Rover boy. 

""If only we knew whether he went down in that opening!"" said Sam, for at least the tenth time. ""Dick, do you suppose we can climb down into it?"" 

""Not without a rope, Sam. The sides are too steep and slippery."" 

Time and again they called down. But no answer came back. If Tom was down there he was either unconscious or dead.

THE MAN AT THE ASTOR 

Refraining from discussing with Master Maloney the alleged bone-headedness of girls, Smith went through into the inner room, and found John sitting in the editorial chair, glancing through the latest number of _Peaceful Moments_. 

""Why, John, friend of my youth,"" he said, ""where have you been hiding all this time? I called you up at your office weeks ago, and an acid voice informed me that you were no longer there. Have you been fired?"" 

""Yes,"" said John. ""Why aren't you on the _News_ any more? Nobody seemed to know where you were, till I met Faraday this morning, who told me you were here."" 

Smith was conscious of an impression that in some subtle way John had changed since their last meeting. For a moment he could not have said what had given him this impression. Then it flashed upon him. Before, John had always been, like Mrs. Fezziwig in ""The Christmas Carol,"" one vast substantial smile.

Henkel was surprised by how obsessed people are with taking pictures these days - before dinner, during friends' birthday parties, on museum tours and so on.You know people just like that, don't you? They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian. In her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. ""When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences,"" Henkel explained.

They keep taking pictures because they think that it helps record the moment, but as Henkel's latest study has just found out, this obsession may prevent their brains from remembering what actually happened, reported The Guardian. In her study, Henkel led a group of college students around a museum and asked them to simply observe 15 objects and to photograph 15 others.The next day the students' memory of the tour was tested, and the results showed that they were less accurate in recognizing the objects and they remembered fewer details about them if they photographed them. ""When people rely on technology to remember for them - counting on the camera to record the event and thus not needing to attend to it fully themselves, it can have a negative effect on how well they remember their experiences,"" Henkel explained. But there is also an exception: if students zoomed in to photograph part of an object, their memory actually improved, and those who focused the lens on a specific area could even recall parts that weren't in the frame.

125,136,"For millions of years, sharks have been the kings of the oceans, the top of the food chain. But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. 

Shark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. 

The competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. 

""I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,"" he said. ""If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.""

The local authority is Liverpool City Council, the most populous local government district within the metropolitan county of Merseyside and the largest within the Liverpool City Region. 

Liverpool is located on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, and historically lay within the ancient hundred of West Derby in the south west of the county of Lancashire. It became a borough in 1207 and a city in 1880. In 1889, it became a county borough independent of Lancashire. Its growth as a major port was paralleled by the expansion of the city throughout the Industrial Revolution. Along with handling general cargo, freight, raw materials such as coal and cotton, the city merchants were involved in the Atlantic slave trade. In the 19th century, it was a major port of departure for Irish and English emigrants to the United States.

THE BATTLE IN THE PLAIN 

The distance from the bottom of the funnel to the floor of the chamber beneath it could not have been great, for all three of the victims of Tario's wrath alighted unscathed. 

Carthoris, still clasping Thuvia tightly to his breast, came to the ground catlike, upon his feet, breaking the shock for the girl. Scarce had his feet touched the rough stone flagging of this new chamber than his sword flashed out ready for instant use. But though the room was lighted, there was no sign of enemy about. 

Carthoris looked toward Jav. The man was pasty white with fear.

139,150,"(CNN) -- Russia and South Ossetia have strongly denied news reports that a motorcade carrying the presidents of Georgia and Poland came under fire, calling the claims ""a provocation"" meant to destabilize the region. 

Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, said there were ""unpredictable people"" in the area. 

""This is a real provocation,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told journalists on Monday. ""It is not the first time that such things have happened: First they mastermind everything themselves and then accuse the Russian or the Ossetian side."" 

Eduard Kokoity, president of the breakaway region of South Ossetia, added: ""Today's event was a deliberate provocative act of the Georgian and Polish presidents targeted at regional destabilization."" 

Kokoity made his comments to the Russian news agency, Interfax. 

The motorcade, carrying Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili and Polish President Lech Kaczynski, was passing a checkpoint near Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia region -- site of intense conflict between Russian and Georgian troops in August -- when shots were fired Sunday, according to the Georgian Interior Ministry. 

The motorcade was not hit and there were no injuries, the Georgian Interior Ministry said. No other shooting was reported in the area. 

The shots were fired from Russian-controlled territory as the motorcade passed, the ministry said. 

Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin denied the gunfire came from its army positions. 

""This is one more instance of wishful thinking on the part of Georgia,"" he told reporters.

142,153,"The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO ; ; '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance between several North American and European states based on the North Atlantic Treaty that was signed on 4 April 1949. 

NATO constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members (the United States, France and the United Kingdom) are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states. NATO Headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, while the headquarters of Allied Command Operations is near Mons, Belgium. 

NATO is an alliance that consists of 29 independent member countries across North America and Europe. An additional 21 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programs. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defense spending is supposed to amount to at least 2% of GDP. 

NATO was little more than a political association until the Korean War galvanized the organization's member states, and an integrated military structure was built up under the direction of two US Supreme Commanders. The course of the Cold War led to a rivalry with nations of the Warsaw Pact, that formed in 1955. Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed, along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defense against a prospective Soviet invasion—doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATO's military structure in 1966 for 30 years. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in Germany in 1989, the organization became involved in the breakup of Yugoslavia, and conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999.

During the summer, he and his 40 helpers dug at 35 different spots. The only things they found were ground spiders, giant ticks, and deadly snakes. 

Just before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ 

But then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked ""Omani Marketplace"" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! 

In December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . 

More digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years. Clapp and his team were excited as they continued to discover more pieces of the past that seemed to prove that it was the lost city of Ubar. 

""We started with this hopeless myth ,"" says Clapp, ""and then finally found the truth behind the myth."" But is this unearthed site really the once-great Ubar? Experts aren't totally persuaded. 

Donald Whitcomb is an archeologist at the University of Chicago. He doubts that Clapp really discovered Ubar. ""There's probably some truth to this myth,"" he says. ""But Ubar is described as a place with walls all made of gold, and the rubies and emeralds ."" No gold or precious stones have been found by Clapp.

ABOUT SOME NEW STUDENTS 

""Hi! hi! what's the meaning of this outrage!"" roared the individual in the buggy, as he brought his horse to a standstill. ""Do you want to kill me?"" 

""Who is it? Is he hurt?"" questioned Dave, quickly. 

""I don't know,"" answered Ben. ""The rod took off his hat, but whether it struck his head or not remains to be seen."" 

""Wot's the trouble back there?"" demanded Jackson Lemond, as he succeeded in bringing his team to a halt. 

""Trouble is, we hit that man with the rod,"" answered Buster. 

""Humph! I told you to be careful,"" grumbled the carryall driver. ""It don't pay to act like a passel o' wildcats, nohow!"" 

""It's too bad it happened,"" said Dave, and leaped to the ground and ran back to where the buggy stood, with the driver glaring at them savagely. The other students followed. 

""Are you hurt?"" asked Dave, anxiously. The man in the buggy was a total stranger to him. 

""Hurt? I don't know whether I am or not. What do you mean by knocking off my hat with that stick?"" 

""It was an accident, sir. We had our school colors on the fishing rod and were waving them in the air. We didn't expect to hit anybody."" 

""Bah! you are a lot of rowdies!"" growled the man. ""Give me my hat!"" And he pointed to where the head covering rested on some bushes. 

""There you are,"" said Ben, restoring the hat to its owner. ""But we are not rowdies--it was purely an accident,"" he added, with a little flash out of his clear eyes.  ",86,test

A NEW ARRIVAL 

After the disappearance of Jarley Bangs the Rover boys and their chums continued their trip on horseback. 

""Let's move over the hill in the direction of the Bimbel ranch,"" suggested Spouter. ""I'd like to get a bird's-eye view of that outfit."" 

""Perhaps we had better not go too close,"" advised Fred. ""Bimbel may be getting out a shotgun for us."" 

""I guess it isn't as bad as all that, Fred. Those things might have happened years ago when the country was more sparsely settled and when there were more bad men around.

A SHOOTING TRIP TO PARADISE ISLE, AND FURTHER DISPLAY OF THE CAPTAIN'S CONTRIVANCES. 

While our explorers were thus reduced to a state of forced inaction as regarded the main object of their expedition, they did not by any means waste their time in idleness. On the contrary, each of the party went zealously to work in the way that was most suitable to his inclination. 

After going over the main island of Poloe as a united party, and ascertaining its size, productions, and general features, the Captain told them they might now do as they pleased. For his part he meant to spend a good deal of his time in taking notes and observations, questioning the chief men as to the lands lying to the northward, repairing and improving the hut, and helping the natives miscellaneously so as to gain their regard. 

Of course Leo spent much of his time with his rifle, for the natives were not such expert hunters but that occasionally they were badly off for food.

Muntadhar al-Zaidi speaks to reporters shorlty after his release from an Iraqi jail. 

Al-Baghdadia TV said Muntadhar al-Zaidi had arrived in Damascus. 

Al-Zaidi's brother, Dhirgham al-Zaidi, told CNN that the 30-year-old journalist was to travel in a private plane to Greece for medical treatment. 

Shortly after he left prison, the 30-year-old journalist visited the studios of his employer, Al-Baghdadia TV, where he spoke to other reporters about his experience. He wore a sash in the colors of the Iraqi national flag draped around his shoulders. 

Muntadhar al-Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush. He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued. 

However, he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison. 

""I got my chance, and I didn't miss it,"" he said. 

""I am not a hero, and I admit that,"" he added. ""I am a person with a stance. I saw my country burning."" 

Al-Zaidi, who was serving a one-year sentence after the jail-throwing incident December 14, was given a ""conditional discharge.""

158,169,"(CNN) -- SeaWorld will resume killer whale shows while the company and two federal agencies investigate the death of a whale trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, company and federal officials announced Friday. 

The shows, which were suspended at all SeaWorld locations after the death Wednesday at SeaWorld Orlando, will resume Saturday with new precautionary measures in place, said Jim Atchison, president of SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment. 

Earlier Friday, the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Agriculture Department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service announced they were looking into the death of Dawn Brancheau, 40. 

Brancheau was pulled underwater when a killer whale named Tilikum grabbed her ponytail. A source at SeaWorld said that after seizing her, the whale dove deep underwater. Trainers eventually had to wrangle the animal into a smaller pool before they could retrieve her body about 40 minutes later.

A former head of animal training said Friday that Brancheau left herself vulnerable to attack and that she may have broken the park's training protocol. 

""Dawn, if she was standing here right now, would tell you that that was her mistake in allowing that to happen,"" said former SeaWorld trainer Thad Lacinak, who had worked with Brancheau in the past, on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""

After nearly a year's captivity, the King engaged to pay a ransom, and, until the terms could be arranged, his two sons were to be placed as hostages in the hands of the Normans, whilst he returned to his own domains. The Princes were to be sent to Bayeux; whither Richard had returned, under the charge of the Centevilles, and was now allowed to ride and walk abroad freely, provided he was accompanied by a guard. 

""I shall rejoice to have Carloman, and make him happy,"" said Richard; ""but I wish Lothaire were not coming."" 

""Perhaps,"" said good Father Lucas, ""he comes that you may have a first trial in your father's last lesson, and Abbot Martin's, and return good for evil.""

He and Alberic betook themselves to the watch-tower, and, by and by, saw a cavalcade approaching, with a curtained vehicle in the midst, slung between two horses. ""That cannot be the Princes,"" said Alberic; ""that must surely be some sick lady."" 

""I only hope it is not the Queen,"" exclaimed Richard, in dismay. ""But no; Lothaire is such a coward, no doubt he was afraid to ride, and she would not trust her darling without shutting him up like a demoiselle. But come down, Alberic; I will say nothing unkind of Lothaire, if I can help it.""

He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. 

That night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep. 

The next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road.

167,178,"Sanaa, Yemen (CNN) -- Yemen's information minister escaped an assassination attempt unharmed Tuesday, his office manager said. 

The minister, Ali al-Amrani, was headed to the prime minister's office when the attack occurred, spokesman Abdul Basit al-Qaedi told CNN. 

At least 10 bullets were shot in the direction of the vehicle al-Amrani was getting into, al-Qaedi said. Three bullets hit the back window and trunk of the car, he added. 

Witnesses said there were at least two gunmen. 

Al-Amrani was not hurt in the attack, al-Qaedi said. 

The minister's office said al-Amrani has been targeted recently in a hate campaign by pro-revolution groups. 

""A number of factions in the country started a hate campaign against the minister and threats were given to him in the past,"" said al-Qaedi. 

Yemen's Interior Ministry told CNN the attack is under investigation, but there are no prime suspects. 

Last week, al-Amrani received a death threat by an anonymous caller from a Saudi telephone number, al-Qaedi said. 

The minister recently launched a massive presidential campaign to support candidate Abdurabu Hadi, the country's current vice president. 

Al-Amrani told CNN the country is facing a critical time for change and all Yemenis must stand together to support Hadi. 

Yemen has been beset with demonstrations against President Ali Abdullah Saleh since early last year, when pro-democratic uprisings spread across the Arab world. 

Demonstrators have continued their protests against the president, despite a power transfer deal that leads to his departure. 

Under the plan, Saleh -- who's been in office for 33 years -- will step down after the February 21 elections and will receive immunity under the plan forged by the Gulf Cooperation Council.

Pontus had recently fallen to the Roman Republic, and although politically he was a proponent of Roman imperialism, Strabo belonged on his mother's side to a prominent family whose members had held important positions under the previous resisting regime of King Mithridates VI of Pontus. 

Strabo's life was characterized by extensive travels. He journeyed to Egypt and Kush, as far west as coastal Tuscany and as far south as Ethiopia in addition to his travels in Asia Minor and the time he spent in Rome. Travel throughout the Mediterranean and Near East, especially for scholarly purposes, was popular during this era and was facilitated by the relative peace enjoyed throughout the reign of Augustus (27 BC – AD 14). He moved to Rome in 44 BC, and stayed there, studying and writing, until at least 31 BC. In 29 BC, on his way to Corinth (where Augustus was at the time), he visited the island of Gyaros in the Aegean Sea.

THE RESCUE--CONCLUSION 

The Rovers and the others on the steam tug could scarcely wait for the old man in the dilapidated rowboat to come up alongside. 

""You have a message for us?"" said Dick. ""Hand it over, quick."" 

""The message says as how you-uns will pay me twenty-five dollars fer delivering of it in twenty-four hours,"" said the old man, cautiously. 

""Who is it from?"" 

""It is signed Dora Stanhope and Nellie Laning."" 

""Give it to me--I'll pay you the money,"" cried Tom. 

""All right, reckon as how I kin trust you-uns,"" said the old man. 

It was Jake Shaggam, who had received the message the evening before. He had read it with interest and started out at daylight to find out something about the Rovers and where they might be located. Good fortune had thrown him directly in our young friends' way. 

""This is really a message from the girls!"" cried Tom, reading it hastily. ""It is in Nellie Laning's handwriting."" 

""And Dora Stanhope has signed her name too,"" added Dick. ""I know her signature well.""

""The message says as how you-uns will pay me twenty-five dollars fer delivering of it in twenty-four hours,"" said the old man, cautiously.

""It is signed Dora Stanhope and Nellie Laning."" 

""Give it to me--I'll pay you the money,"" cried Tom. 

""All right, reckon as how I kin trust you-uns,"" said the old man. 

It was Jake Shaggam, who had received the message the evening before. He had read it with interest and started out at daylight to find out something about the Rovers and where they might be located. Good fortune had thrown him directly in our young friends' way. 

""This is really a message from the girls!"" cried Tom, reading it hastily. ""It is in Nellie Laning's handwriting."" 

""And Dora Stanhope has signed her name too,"" added Dick. ""I know her signature well.""

171,182,"(CNN)As art, film stills are often overlooked. 

The photographers tend to be anonymous; it's easy to imagine their work done by the director or cinematographer. Their images are often lumped in with the promotional machinery: Whether documenting the stars frolicking on set or getting down to business, it's just another form of salesmanship. 

Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. 

Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets. It was a necessity in those early days, said John Jacob, the editor of a new book of Haas' movie photography, ""Ernst Haas: On Set."" 

""Working on film sets was really important to Magnum, and all of the photographers working with Magnum in the '50s did films,"" says Jacob, now the McEvoy Family Curator for Photography at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Not only did the work pay off financially, but the photographers also established relationships with members of the industry, he said. 

And the stars and directors knew what they were getting: some of the best in the field. Photographers such as Haas were entrusted to bring their talent and style to the work. 

The photographers ""are definitely producing work for posterity, that very much has their own fingerprint on it,"" Jacob said.

173,184,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film ""Do the Right Thing,"" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. 

Spike Lee: ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" 

""This movie is dynamite under every seat,"" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. 

Other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. 

Instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. ""Do the Right Thing"" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. 

Twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: ""Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,"" he wrote in 2001. 

So what is the thing about ""Do the Right Thing?"" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words » 

Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, ""She's Gotta Have It"" (1986) and ""School Daze"" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was ""Do the Right Thing,"" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.  Q: Who created Do the Right Thing? A: Spike Lee. Q: When? A: 1989. Q: Why were newspaper writers concerned? A: they said it would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. Q: Were they right?

174,185,"(CNN) -- Radical Islamic websites Wednesday posted an Arab Spring audio message purportedly recorded by Osama bin Laden shortly before he was killed. 

The recording, which is more than 12 minutes long and was released by al Qaeda's media arm, As-Sahab, lists the speaker as bin Laden and calls him ""the martyr of Islam."" 

The audio begins with a prayer and remarks reportedly made by bin Laden about anti-government protests and uprisings earlier this year in several African and Middle East countries. 

CNN, which translated the audio, could not confirm its authenticity. 

The Islamic date with the audio indicates it was recorded between April 4 and May 3.

178,189,"Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. 

Also known in more dated English as Sleswick-Holsatia, the Danish name is ""Slesvig-Holsten,"" the Low German name is ""Sleswig-Holsteen,"" and the North Frisian name is ""Slaswik-Holstiinj."" Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig) in Denmark. 

The term ""Holstein"" derives from Old Saxon ""Holseta Land,"" (""Holz"" and ""Holt"" mean wood in modern Standardised German and in literary English, respectively). Originally, it referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: ""Tedmarsgoi"" (Dithmarschen), Holstein and ""Sturmarii"" (Stormarn).

Context: {} Q: {} A:","Schleswig-Holstein is the northernmost of the 16 states of Germany, comprising most of the historical duchy of Holstein and the southern part of the former Duchy of Schleswig. Its capital city is Kiel; other notable cities are Lübeck and Flensburg. 

Also known in more dated English as Sleswick-Holsatia, the Danish name is ""Slesvig-Holsten,"" the Low German name is ""Sleswig-Holsteen,"" and the North Frisian name is ""Slaswik-Holstiinj."" Historically, the name can also refer to a larger region, containing both present-day Schleswig-Holstein and the former South Jutland County (Northern Schleswig) in Denmark. 

The term ""Holstein"" derives from Old Saxon ""Holseta Land,"" (""Holz"" and ""Holt"" mean wood in modern Standardised German and in literary English, respectively). Originally, it referred to the central of the three Saxon tribes north of the River Elbe: ""Tedmarsgoi"" (Dithmarschen), Holstein and ""Sturmarii"" (Stormarn). The area of the tribe of the Holsts was between the Stör River and Hamburg, and after Christianization, their main church was in Schenefeld. Saxon Holstein became a part of the Holy Roman Empire after Charlemagne's Saxon campaigns in the late eighth century. Since 811, the northern frontier of Holstein (and thus the Empire) was marked by the River Eider.

179,190,"A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. 

Law enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property.

Founded in 1847, and formerly self-styled as the ""World's Greatest Newspaper"" (for which WGN radio and television are named), it remains the most-read daily newspaper of the Chicago metropolitan area and the Great Lakes region. It is the eighth-largest newspaper in the United States by circulation (and became the second-largest under Tribune's ownership after the ""Chicago Tribune""s parent company purchased the ""Los Angeles Times""). 

Traditionally published as a broadsheet, on January 13, 2009, the ""Tribune"" announced it would continue publishing as a broadsheet for home delivery, but would publish in tabloid format for newsstand, news box, and commuter station sales. This change, however, proved to be unpopular with readers and in August 2011, the ""Tribune"" discontinued the tabloid edition, returning to its traditional broadsheet edition through all distribution channels. 

The ""Tribune""s masthead is notable for displaying the American flag, in reference to the paper's motto, ""An American Paper for Americans."" The motto is no longer displayed on the masthead, where it was placed below the flag.

The Hound Restored

A traitor had just come in and told them where Bruce had slept the night before. Reluctantly Archie unfastened the chain from the pole, and holding the end in his hand went round with Hector to the front of the pavilion. He was resolved that if under the dog's guidance the party came close up with Bruce, he would kill the dog and then try to escape by fleetness of foot, though of this, as there were so many mounted men in the party, he had but slight hope. Led by the peasant they proceeded to the hut, which was five miles away in the hills. On reaching it Hector at once became greatly excited.

One Day International matches are also called Limited Overs Internationals (LOI), although this generic term may also refer to Twenty20 International matches. They are major matches and considered the highest standard of List A, limited overs competition. 

The international one-day game is a late twentieth-century development. The first ODI was played on 5 January 1971 between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. When the first three days of the third Test were washed out officials decided to abandon the match and, instead, play a one-off one day game consisting of 40 eight-ball overs per side. Australia won the game by 5 wickets. ODIs were played in white kits with a red ball. 

In the late 1970s, Kerry Packer established the rival World Series Cricket competition, and it introduced many of the features of One Day International cricket that are now commonplace, including coloured uniforms, matches played at night under floodlights with a white ball and dark sight screens, and, for television broadcasts, multiple camera angles, effects microphones to capture sounds from the players on the pitch, and on-screen graphics. The first of the matches with coloured uniforms was the WSC Australians in wattle gold versus WSC West Indians in coral pink, played at VFL Park in Melbourne on 17 January 1979. This led not only to Kerry Packer's Channel 9 getting the TV rights to cricket in Australia but also led to players worldwide being paid to play, and becoming international professionals, no longer needing jobs outside cricket. Matches played with coloured kits and a white ball became more commonplace over time, and the use of white flannels and a red ball in ODIs was finally abandoned in 2001. Q: How long is an ODI? A: One Day. Q: What does ODI stand for? A: One Day International. Q: What are they also called? A: Limited Overs Internationals. Q: What does that also refer to? A: Twenty20 International matches.

Five minutes after Paula had left him, punctual to the second, the four telegrams disposed of, Dick was getting into a ranch motor car, along with Thayer, the Idaho buyer, and Naismith, the special correspondent for the _Breeders' Gazette_. Wardman, the sheep manager, joined them at the corrals where several thousand young Shropshire rams had been assembled for inspection. 

There was little need for conversation. Thayer was distinctly disappointed in this, for he felt that the purchase of ten carloads of such expensive creatures was momentous enough to merit much conversation. 

""They speak for themselves,"" Dick had assured him, and turned aside to give data to Naismith for his impending article on Shropshires in California and the Northwest. 

""I wouldn't advise you to bother to select them,"" Dick told Thayer ten minutes later. ""The average is all top. You could spend a week picking your ten carloads and have no higher grade than if you had taken the first to hand."" 

This cool assumption that the sale was already consummated so perturbed Thayer, that, along with the sure knowledge that he had never seen so high a quality of rams, he was nettled into changing his order to twenty carloads. 

As he told Naismith, after they had regained the Big House and as they chalked their cues to finish the interrupted game:

210,221,"A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. 

Law enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing. 

Law enforcement, however, constitutes only part of policing activity. Policing has included an array of activities in different situations, but the predominant ones are concerned with the preservation of order. In some societies, in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these developed within the context of maintaining the class system and the protection of private property. Many police forces suffer from police corruption to a greater or lesser degree. The police force is usually a public sector service, meaning they are paid through taxes.",43,train

Which is why the work of Ernst Haas is so striking. 

Haas, one of the 20th century's great photojournalists and image-makers -- an early member of the great Magnum Photos cooperative who was famous enough in his prime to have been the subject of a Museum of Modern Art exhibit in 1962 -- was also a regular on movie sets.

""_Benedict_. What, my dear Lady Disdain, are you yet living?"" 

""_Beatrice_. Is it possible Disdain should die while she has such meet food to feed her?"" 

_Much Ado about Nothing._ 

The Lyddell family did not continue in London much longer; it had been a short season, and though the session of Parliament was not over, most of the ladies were taking flight into the country, before the end of June,--Mrs. Lyddell among the rest,--and her husband went backwards and forwards to London, as occasion called him. 

The girls were glad to get into the country, but Marian soon found that she had not escaped either from gaieties, or from the objects of her aversion; for Mr. Faulkner brought his mother and sisters to High Down House, gave numerous parties there, and made a constant interchange of civilities with the family at Oakworthy. Archery was pretty much the fashion with the young ladies that year; it was a sport which Marian liked particularly, having often practised it with Edmund and Agnes, and her bow and arrows were always the first to be ready. 

One day when Marian, Caroline, and Clara were shooting on the lawn at Oakworthy, Mr. and Miss Faulkner rode from High Down, came out on the lawn, and joined them. From that moment, any one could see the change that came over Marian. Instead of laughing and talking, teaching Clara, and paying only half attention to her own shooting, she now went on as if it was her sole object, and as if she had no other purpose in life. She fixed her arrows and twanged her string with a rigidity as if the target had been a deadly enemy, or her whole fate was concentrated in hitting the bull's eye; and when her arrows went straight to the mark, or at least much straighter than those of any one else, she never turned her head, or vouchsafed more than the briefest answer to the exclamations around.

217,228,"As we drove along, my spirits went up again, and I turned, with pleasure, to the thought of the new life which I was entering. But though it was not far past the middle of September, the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to make the day extremely cold; and the journey seemed a very long one, so that it was nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination. Yet when we entered the gateway, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or two farther off. For the first time in my life I must stand alone: there was no retreating now. I must enter that house, and introduce myself among its strange people. But how was it to be done? True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was. Yet, anyway. I would do very well, after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease with them. 

""Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,"" I said within myself; and truly I was so fully occupied in steadying my nerves and keeping down the rebellious beat of my heart that when I was admitted into the hall and into the presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite greeting; and it afterwards struck me that the little I did say was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep. 

With due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me there to take a little refreshment for a little while and led me into the dining-room. Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I thought) and trying to keep something like a conversation-- consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks. In fact, my attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands. 

""I have had so little time to attend to their education myself, but I think they are clever children, and very willing to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock-- a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth."" ""His sister Mary Ann will require watching,"" continued she, ""but she is a very good girl on the whole, though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her bed to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to look after her washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she needs to have nothing further to do with the nursery maid."" 

I replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment the children entered the room. Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven. Mary was a tall girl, for her age of six, somewhat dark like her mother. The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl, looking little younger than Mary. The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two, whom I had more desire for than all the rest -- but with her I had nothing to do.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","As we drove along, my spirits went up again, and I turned, with pleasure, to the thought of the new life which I was entering. But though it was not far past the middle of September, the heavy clouds and strong north-easterly wind combined to make the day extremely cold; and the journey seemed a very long one, so that it was nearly one o'clock before we reached the place of our destination. Yet when we entered the gateway, my heart failed me, and I wished it were a mile or two farther off. For the first time in my life I must stand alone: there was no retreating now. I must enter that house, and introduce myself among its strange people. But how was it to be done? True, I was near nineteen; but, thanks to the protecting care of my mother and sister, I well knew that many a girl of fifteen, or under, was gifted with a more womanly address, and greater ease and self-possession, than I was. Yet, anyway. I would do very well, after all; and the children, of course, I should soon be at ease with them. 

""Be calm, be calm, whatever happens,"" I said within myself; and truly I was so fully occupied in steadying my nerves and keeping down the rebellious beat of my heart that when I was admitted into the hall and into the presence of Mrs. Bloomfield, I almost forgot to answer her polite greeting; and it afterwards struck me that the little I did say was spoken in the tone of one half-dead or half-asleep. 

With due politeness, however, she showed me my bedroom, and left me there to take a little refreshment for a little while and led me into the dining-room. Some beefsteaks and potatoes were set before me; and while I dined upon these, she sat opposite, watching me (as I thought) and trying to keep something like a conversation-- consisting chiefly of commonplace remarks. In fact, my attention was almost wholly absorbed in my dinner: not from appetite, but from the toughness of the beefsteaks, and the numbness of my hands. 

""I have had so little time to attend to their education myself, but I think they are clever children, and very willing to learn, especially the little boy; he is, I think, the flower of the flock-- a generous, noble-spirited boy, one to be led, but not driven, and remarkable for always speaking the truth."" ""His sister Mary Ann will require watching,"" continued she, ""but she is a very good girl on the whole, though I wish her to be kept out of the nursery as much as possible, as she is now almost six years old, and might acquire bad habits from the nurses. I have ordered her bed to be placed in your room, and if you will be so kind as to look after her washing and dressing, and take charge of her clothes, she needs to have nothing further to do with the nursery maid."" 

I replied I was quite willing to do so; and at that moment the children entered the room. Tom Bloomfield was a well-grown boy of seven. Mary was a tall girl, for her age of six, somewhat dark like her mother. The second sister was Fanny, a very pretty little girl, looking little younger than Mary. The remaining one was Harriet, a little broad, fat, merry, playful thing of scarcely two, whom I had more desire for than all the rest -- but with her I had nothing to do. ",55,train

People leave more bags and umbrellas on buses and in stores on low pressure days. There is a""perfect weather""for work and health. People feel best at a tempera- ture of about 64F with 65 percent humidity . Are you feeling sick, sad, tired, forgetful, or very intelligent today? The weather may be the reason.",236,test

Just before Thanksgiving says Clapp, _ 

But then Clapp's team looked at the high-tech maps again and saw something surprising. Many of the caravan routes on the high-tech maps came together on the same spot marked ""Omani Marketplace"" on Ptolomy's map. Two maps, made almost 2000 years apart, pointed the team toward the same area! 

In December 1991, Clapp arrived at the spot where, according to the maps, the caravans met. Clapp had a handheld instrument that could detect objects below the ground. It showed ruins under the sand! He and his team started digging. And then they found it! A tower buried in the sand. They slowly unearthed a giant, eight-sided fortress . It had nine towers and many rooms. People had lived in this fortress 2000 years ago. Outside its walls, they had found buried remains of nearly 40 campsites. They seemed to be camping areas for traders . 

More digging found shards, or pieces of pottery from ancient Rome, Greece, China, Egypt, and Syria. Diggers and scientists agree that people were here for about 5000 years. Clapp and his team were excited as they continued to discover more pieces of the past that seemed to prove that it was the lost city of Ubar. 

""We started with this hopeless myth ,"" says Clapp, ""and then finally found the truth behind the myth."" But is this unearthed site really the once-great Ubar? Experts aren't totally persuaded. 

Donald Whitcomb is an archeologist at the University of Chicago. He doubts that Clapp really discovered Ubar. ""There's probably some truth to this myth,"" he says.

228,239,"(CNN) -- The Supreme Court has just agreed to take on the case of Fisher v. University of Texas. Abigail Fisher, a white woman, argues that she has been a victim of the university's race-conscious admission policies; the university contends that its drive for racial and ethnic diversity is educationally enriching -- a benefit to all students. 

Will the ugly discourse that generally characterizes debate over racially preferential policies disappear with the wave of a magic Supreme Court wand? It seems unlikely. The issue is a cat with many more than nine lives. It arrived in the early 1970s and, despite many attacks, some of which have taken the form of amendments to state constitutions, it has survived in pretty fine fettle. 

The court will have only eight justices to hear the arguments. Elena Kagan, having been involved in the case as solicitor general in the Obama administration, has bowed out of participation. Her absence, however, leaves five justices likely to express at least some degree of skepticism about the racial preferences given to non-Asian minorities in the admissions process. 

Has the University of Texas been enriched by academic diversity? Maybe. But equally likely is the possibility that racial double standards reinforce stereotypes about smart whites and even smarter Asians. There are certainly wide gaps in the average SAT scores between blacks and Hispanics, on the one hand, and whites and Asians, on the other hand. 

Among freshmen entering the University of Texas in 2009 who did not fall into the top 10% of their high school class (automatic admission at the university), Asians scored at the 93rd percentile of 2009 SAT takers nationwide, whites at the 89th percentile, Hispanics at the 80th percentile and blacks at the 52nd percentile. Startling? No. This picture has been well known for a long time. Heartbreaking, yes, because the numbers mean the underperforming minority students are being woefully ill served by the K-12 school system. Moreover, arriving at institutions of higher education with an academic disadvantage, they do not catch up, as it has become clear.  Q: What does being in the top 10% of your high school class get you? A: automatic admission. Q: To where? A: at the university. Q: Which one? A: University of Texas.

233,244,"Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, Ireland is a unitary parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic. 

It is an element of both the parliamentary and the presidential systems of government and is typically used in a lower chamber such as the House of Commons (United Kingdom) or Dáil Éireann (Republic of Ireland), and may be curtailed by constitutional constraints such as an upper chamber.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","Representative democracy (also indirect democracy, representative republic, or psephocracy) is a type of democracy founded on the principle of elected officials representing a group of people, as opposed to direct democracy. Nearly all modern Western-style democracies are types of representative democracies; for example, the United Kingdom is a constitutional monarchy, Ireland is a unitary parliamentary republic, and the United States is a federal republic. 

It is an element of both the parliamentary and the presidential systems of government and is typically used in a lower chamber such as the House of Commons (United Kingdom) or Dáil Éireann (Republic of Ireland), and may be curtailed by constitutional constraints such as an upper chamber.

It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of −2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus. 

Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has at least 69 moons, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.

241,252,"(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. 

The search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. 

Agents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. 

Supervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. 

Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. 

Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. 

Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. 

The area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. 

Although prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment.  Q: Whose house was searched? A: Gary Giordano. Q: In what city? A: Gaithersburg. Q: County? A: Montgomery County. Q: State? A: Maryland. Q: Where is he now? A: Aruban jail. Q: Why? A: suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman. Q: What organization is doing the search? A: FBI. Q: How many unmarked vehicles were there? A: 15. Q: Who spoke for the Aruban government?

Context: {} Q: {} A:","(CNN) -- FBI agents on Friday night searched the Maryland home of the suspect in the recent disappearance of an American woman in Aruba, an agent said. 

The search is occurring in the Gaithersburg residence of Gary Giordano, who is currently being held in an Aruban jail, FBI Special Agent Rich Wolf told CNN. 

Agents, wearing vests that said FBI and carrying empty cardboard and plastic boxes, arrived about 8:40 p.m. Friday. About 15 unmarked cars could be seen on the street, as well as a Montgomery County police vehicle. 

Supervisory Special Agent Philip Celestini, who was at the residence, declined to comment further on the search, citing the active investigation. 

Aruban Solicitor General Taco Stein said earlier Friday that the suspect will appear in court Monday, where an investigating magistrate could order him held for at least eight more days, order him to remain on the island or release him outright due to a lack of evidence. 

Giordano was arrested by Aruban police on August 5, three days after Robyn Gardner was last seen near Baby Beach on the western tip of the Caribbean island. 

Giordano told authorities that he had been snorkeling with Gardner when he signaled to her to swim back, according to a statement. When he reached the beach, Gardner was nowhere to be found, Giordano allegedly said. 

The area that Giordano led authorities to is a rocky, unsightly location that locals say is not a popular snorkeling spot. 

Although prosecutors have continued to identify the 50-year-old American man by his initials, GVG, they also released a photo of a man who appears to be Giordano. His attorney, Michael Lopez, also has said that his client is being held as a suspect in Gardner's death. Lopez has not returned telephone calls seeking comment.",13,test

A JOYFUL MEETING. 

It is highly probable that one might have searched over New York City that night and not found a happier household than that of Mrs. Green's. Paul was so wonderfully happy in the thought that he was going back to Chicago, where, even though he could not see his parents, he should find relatives and friends, that he could talk of little else. Even the theatre was forgotten by him; for when Mopsey spoke of the necessity of getting another boy to take his place in the dramatic company he hardly gave the matter a thought, except to say that he hoped they would make plenty of money out of it. And Paul's partners were happy, more happy than they could possibly have been by any other outlay of their money; Paul's pleasure reflected on them to such a degree that they became almost as much excited as he was before the evening was over. 

Good Mrs. Green alternately laughed and cried, until she seemed to realize that such nervousness was not exactly suitable to the occasion, and then she busied herself by reading one of the papers Ben had brought home. 

Master Treat had spent so much time on the good work he had carried through so successfully, and then had paid so much more attention to the boy he was going to surprise than to the sale of his goods, that, instead of helping Johnny as had been his purpose when he took some of his papers to sell, he was a drawback, and the consequence was that Mrs. Green had three evening papers to read, while Messrs.

Most readers know that his real name was Samuel Longhome Clemens, but how many know where the pen name ""Mark Twain"" came from? The answer shows Clemens' colorful early life before he became a writer. ""Mark Twain"" was the cry shouted on a ship when the ship entered a part of a river that was two fathoms (6 feet) deep. ""Twain"" is an old-fashioned way of saying ""two"". Twain trained as a ship pilot on the Mississippi river for two years, a time that he wrote about in the humourousLife on the Mississippi (1883). The famous river would become an important theme in many of his works--who could forget the journey of the Huck and Jim along it in his most famous book. The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884)? With little education, he had to teach himself how to write stories. Whenever possible, he would go to public libraries. There he spent much time reading and thinking, which greatly helped him with his writing. On the other hand, his life experiences gave him wonderful material to write about and attract readers. Twain wrote in a style that has been called ""local colour"" because it shows great knowledge of local people and their customs. This _ is very clear in the two books for which Twain is still celebrated today.

Muntadhar al-Zaidi speaks to reporters shorlty after his release from an Iraqi jail. 

Al-Baghdadia TV said Muntadhar al-Zaidi had arrived in Damascus. 

Al-Zaidi's brother, Dhirgham al-Zaidi, told CNN that the 30-year-old journalist was to travel in a private plane to Greece for medical treatment. 

Shortly after he left prison, the 30-year-old journalist visited the studios of his employer, Al-Baghdadia TV, where he spoke to other reporters about his experience. He wore a sash in the colors of the Iraqi national flag draped around his shoulders. 

Muntadhar al-Zaidi said he was beaten with cables and pipes and tortured with electricity immediately after guards removed him from a news conference for hurling both shoes at Bush. He said he was taken into another room and beaten even as the news conference continued. 

However, he remained defiant about the incident that landed him in prison.

""I am not a hero, and I admit that,"" he added. ""I am a person with a stance. I saw my country burning.""

But he felt that he simply had got to speak his mind to someone, so he swam across to where he had seen Peter Rabbit almost every night since Paddy began to build. Sure enough, Peter was there, sitting up very straight and staring with big round eyes at the platform of mud and sticks out in the water where Paddy the Beaver was at work.

Plymouth's early history extends to the Bronze Age, when a first settlement emerged at Mount Batten. This settlement continued as a trading post for the Roman Empire, until it was surpassed by the more prosperous village of Sutton, now called Plymouth. In 1620, the Pilgrim Fathers departed Plymouth for the New World and established Plymouth Colony – the second English settlement in what is now the United States of America. During the English Civil War the town was held by the Parliamentarians and was besieged between 1642 and 1646. 

Throughout the Industrial Revolution, Plymouth grew as a commercial shipping port, handling imports and passengers from the Americas, and exporting local minerals (tin, copper, lime, china clay and arsenic) while the neighbouring town of Devonport became a strategic Royal Naval shipbuilding and dockyard town. In 1914 three neighbouring independent towns, viz., the county borough of Plymouth, the county borough of Devonport, and the urban district of East Stonehouse were merged to form a single County Borough. The combined town took the name of Plymouth which, in 1928, achieved city status.

Ancelotti said Ghana midfielder Michael Essien would return to the Chelsea line-up, having missed the Liverpool game with a toe problem, but Frank Lampard is not yet ready to make his long-awaited return. 

The England midfielder, who has been sidelined following a hernia operation, is scheduled to make his comeback against Sunderland on Sunday. 

""Lampard has been training with us and he is good. He is able to play; he is fit because he worked very hard physically,"" Ancelotti said.",12,test

But these days, the hunter has become the hunted, because of better methods from commercial fishermen who are looking for fins to make expensive soup sold mostly in Asia. Shark fins are far more valuable than shark meat, so fishermen cut the fins off live fish and throw the sharks overboard to maximize the catch they bring back. 

Shark finning is illegal in the United States, but there're tournament sport fishermen, who target and kill the biggest ones they take from the sea. These tournaments, the prizes of which can reach $5,000 or more, attract large crowds of anglers but also draw protests from animal rights groups and environmentalists. 

The competitors say they are enjoying a fun and legal sport, the impact on the overall shark population is very small, and most of the sharks caught are returned to the ocean. Dave Johnson, who is from Kennebunkport, Maine, said no one ever comes close to the limit set by the government of killing one shark per day during the three-month season. 

""I enjoy watching these animals, but I also enjoy catching and releasing them, and very rarely killing them and eating them,"" he said. ""If I thought killing one shark was endangering the species and contributing to their decline I'd stop doing it tomorrow.""

Context: {} Q: {} A:","Jenny loves singing. But her baby sister is crying so loud that Jenny can't hear herself, so she was angry! Her Mom said she could try to play with her sister, but that only made her baby sister cry louder. Jenny tried to ask the baby to stop crying, but that didn't work. Jenny was getting tired, but she had an idea. She would give her baby sister one of her toy horses. The baby loved horses! The baby played with the horse, but then she started crying again. This made Jenny sad. She wanted to sing! Then she had a great idea. She would give the baby a pacifier! This worked. The baby stopped crying and Jenny started singing. Everyone was so happy!

This was the girl I took to Kleinfeld, the fancy store featured on the television program Say Yes to the Dress. As the trip approached, I asked Marina if she was excited. Sure, Mom. shed say, shrugging. Marina was more excited about getting a tattoo on her ankle to represent my fight with ALS than trying on $ 10,000 wedding gowns. 

My sister, Stephanie, had arranged for a car with a wheelchair lift to drive us from the hotel to Kleinfeld. The car driver wheeled me in. 

At Kleinfeld with flower arrangements ten feet high, I felt like rolling into a dream. ""Wow!"" I said. I was wearing a new black outfit. Marina wore jean shorts, a sleeveless shirt, and sneakers. _ . The kind Kleinfeld ladies pointed out rooms like tour guides, naming the designers one by one on display: Alita Grham, Pnina Tornai... With Marina walking beside me, Stephanie pushed my chair up and down rows and rows of dresses that made Princess Diana's dress look modest. 

Marina didn't say a word. We turned a corner into the storage room, where hundreds of dresses hung in plastic protector sleeves. Marina and I were overwhelmed. 

""Want to try one on ?"" I said, touching Marina's hand. 

""OK,"" Marina said in her sharp, unsure voice. 

""Tell them the style you'd like."" 

Marina stood silent. I felt bad for bringing her, for forcing such an adult experience on a child. 

Marina picked an A-line dress. Or, more precisely, the ladies of Kleinfeld picked it for her. Marina was too shocked to do more than nod. As she took the gown into the dressing room, I tried not to think of my little girl on her wedding day or of her as a baby in my arms. I tried not to think of her with her own baby in her arms one day. 

I tried not to think of Marina right now, embarrassed by her mother's plans, by things she could not and should not yet understand. 

I am leaving money in my will for Marina's wedding dress. Stephanie has promised to bring her back to Kleinfeld to purchase it. 

""No pure white!"" I said to Stephanie. ""Ivory. Not too much tulle . Think lace."" 

""Think royalty when picking a dress,"" I advised Steph as we waited outside the dressing room. ""Think Princes Kate. Elegant. Think long sleeves. They make dresses more formal."" 

Marina came out, sleeveless, flared . She looked like a 14-year-old girl in the middle of a giant cupcake. 

""I don't like the loose gown."" she said. 

That's my girl! 

""How about trying on one with long sleeves?"" I asked her. 

The ladies brought out a dress with long lace sleeves, an Empire collar, a ruched fitted waist, and a long, smooth silk skirt. 

Marina disappeared into the dressing room. When the door opened, she looked a foot taller and a decade older. I could clearly see the beautiful woman she will be one day. I simply stared. 

What do you do when you glimpse a moment you will not live to see? 

I dipped my head. Breathe, I told myself. I looked up. I smiled. Marina smiled back. 

I worked my tongue into position to speak. ""I like it,"" I said. 

In that dress, Marina stood straight, shining brightly, and tall.

270,281,"Most people know precious gemstones by their appearances. An emerald flashes deep green, a ruby seems to hold a red fire inside, and a diamond shines like a star. It's more difficult to tell where the gem was mined, since a diamond from Australia or Arkansas may appear the same to one from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, recently, a team of scientists has found a way to identify a gemstone's origin. 

Beneath the surface of a gemstone, on the tiny level of atoms and molecules , lie clues to its origin. At this year's meeting of the Geological Society of America in Minneapolis, Catherine McManus reported on a technique that uses lasers to clarify these clues and identify a stone's homeland. McManus directs scientific research at Materialytics, in Killeen, Texas. The company is developing the technique. ""With enough data, we could identify which country, which mining place, even the individual mine a gemstone comes from,"" McManus told Science News. 

Some gemstones, including many diamonds, come from war-torn countries. Sales of those ""blood minerals"" may encourage violent civil wars where innocent people are injured or killed. In an effort to reduce the trade in blood minerals, the U.S. government passed law in July 2010 that requires companies that sell gemstones to determine the origins of their stones. 

To figure out where gemstones come from, McManus and her team focus a powerful laser on a small sample of the gemstone. The technique is called laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy. Just as heat can turn ice into water or water into steam, energy from the laser changes the state of matter of the stone. The laser changes a miniscule part of the gemstone into plasma, a gas state of matter in which tiny particles called electrons separate from atoms. 

The plasma, which is superhot, produces a light pattern. (The science of analyzing this kind of light pattern is called spectroscopy.) Different elements produce different patterns, but McManus and her team say that gemstones from the same area produce similar patterns. Materialytics has already collected patterns from thousands of gemstones, including more than 200 from diamonds. They can compare the light pattern from an unknown gemstone to patterns they do know and look for a match. The light pattern acts like a signature, telling the researchers the origin of the gemstone. 

In a small test, the laser technique correctly identified the origins of 95 out of every 100 diamonds. For gemstones like emeralds and rubies, the technique proved successful for 98 out of every 100 stones. The scientists need to collect and analyze more samples, including those from war-torn countries, before the tool is ready for commercial use. 

Scientists like Barbara Dutrow, a mineralogist from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, find the technique exciting. ""This is a basic new tool that could provide a better fingerprint of a material from a particular locality,"" she told Science News. Q: Has a team of scientists found a way to identify a gemstone's origin? A: Yes. Q: Where  lie clues to a gemstone's origin? A: Beneath the surface of a gemstone.

THE MEETING FOR RAIN. 

Meanwhile the Auld Lichts were in church, waiting for their minister, and it was a full meeting, because nearly every well in Thrums had been scooped dry by anxious palms. Yet not all were there to ask God's rain for themselves. Old Charles Yuill was in his pew, after dreaming thrice that he would break up with the drought; and Bell Christison had come, though her man lay dead at home, and she thought it could matter no more to her how things went in the world.

281,292,"A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. 

Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. 

Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. ""We were desperate,"" said Matouk. 

The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. ""We are very satisfied with the results,"" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. 

Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow.

286,297,"A famous building in New York City is turning 100 years old. A year-long celebration is planned for Grand Central Terminal, which is usually called Grand Central station, the sixth most-visited place in the world. The huge building has not changed much since it opened in February, 1913. About 750,000 people pass through Grand Central every day. Some just come to look at it, others to visit the stores. But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground. The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years. In all those years, he has not lost his interest in the building. Justin Ferate, a historian, has been giving tours of Grand Central Station for 30 years. He says the station was designed to make travel a pleasure. ""Why people don't run into each other in Grand Central is simple: each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your leg. Each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your arm. Each block of stone is a different color, so it's a checkerboard, based on you."" A ten-year-long fight against plans to build a huge office building over Grand Central in 1968 helped create the modern preservation movement.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","A famous building in New York City is turning 100 years old. A year-long celebration is planned for Grand Central Terminal, which is usually called Grand Central station, the sixth most-visited place in the world. The huge building has not changed much since it opened in February, 1913. About 750,000 people pass through Grand Central every day. Some just come to look at it, others to visit the stores. But most are there to catch the trains that enter and leave from the station. It is the largest train station in the world. There are 67 train tracks, all of them underground. The main part of the building has large, arched windows, a jeweled four-sided clock and ticket windows. Grand Central has been seen in many movies through the years. Dan Brucker is with the New York Transit Authority, which operates the station. Dan Brucker has worked for the transit authority at Grand Central for 30 years. In all those years, he has not lost his interest in the building. Justin Ferate, a historian, has been giving tours of Grand Central Station for 30 years. He says the station was designed to make travel a pleasure. ""Why people don't run into each other in Grand Central is simple: each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your leg. Each block of stone in Grand Central is the length of your arm. Each block of stone is a different color, so it's a checkerboard, based on you."" A ten-year-long fight against plans to build a huge office building over Grand Central in 1968 helped create the modern preservation movement. Now, no one would think of changing the beauty of the station.",39,train
287,298,"(CNN) -- It's a Friday in May, 2005, and Schapelle Corby stands in the center of packed courtroom on the tropical island of Bali, waiting to learn her fate. Will the beauty school student from Australia's Gold Coast be found guilty of smuggling a large bag of marijuana into Indonesia -- where the maximum penalty for drug trafficking is death by firing squad? 

A furrow forms between the 27-year-old's eyebrows as the judge reads out the verdict in Bahasa Indonesia. 

Corby appears confused. Her piercing blue eyes dart around the room -- at her family, at the cameras broadcasting live to televisions around Australia, at the ground, at her interpreter. Then reality sets in. 

Guilty -- the judge said. Her sentence? Twenty years in a Bali prison. 

At the back of the court, members of her family erupt with anger. 

""It's not alright! How dare you?"" screams her sister, Mercedes. 

""We swore on the Bible to tell the truth and your fellow lied!"" her mother, Rosleigh Rose, booms at the prosecutors. 

As her daughter is led away, Rose makes a promise: ""Schapelle, you will come home. Our government will bring you home."" 

Not since Lindy Chamberlain claimed a dingo took her baby in the Outback have Australians become so caught up in a courtroom drama. Nearly nine years on from the verdict, interest remains strong enough to sustain a soon-to-be-broadcast Australian telemovie based on the case.

293,304,"PITTSBURGH - For most people, snakes seem unpleasant or even threatening. But Howie Choset sees in their delicate movements a way to save lives. 

The 37-year-old Carnegie Mellon University professor has spent years developing snake-like robots he hopes will eventually slide through fallen buildings in search of victims trapped after natural disasters or other emergencies. 

Dan Kara is president of Robotics Trends, a Northboro, Mass.-based company that publishes an online industry magazine and runs robotics trade shows. He said there are other snake-like robots being developed, mainly at universities, but didn't know of one that could climb pipes. 

The Carnegie Mellon machines are designed to carry cameras and electronic sensors and can be controlled with a joystick . They move smoothly with the help of small electric motors, or servos, commonly used by hobbyists in model airplanes. 

Built from lightweight materials, the robots are about the size of a human arm or smaller. They can sense which way is up, but are only as good as their human operators, Choset added. 

Sam Stover, a search term manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency based in Indiana, said snake-type robots would offer greater mobility than equipment currently available, such as cameras attached to extendable roles. 

""It just allows us to do something we've not been able to do before,"" Stover said, ""We needed them yesterday."" 

He said snifter dogs are still the best search tool for rescue workers, but that they can only be used effectively when workers have access to damaged building. 

Stover, among the rescue workers who handled the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, said snake robots would have helped rescuers search flooded houses in that disaster.

It will be remembered that some weeks before Elsa's forced marriage in the Red Mill, Foy, on their escape from the Gevangenhuis, had been carried upon the naked back of Martin to the shelter of Mother Martha's lair in the Haarlemer Meer. Here he lay sick many days, for the sword cut in his thigh festered so badly that at one time his life was threatened by gangrene, but, in the end, his own strength and healthy constitution, helped with Martha's simples, cured him. So soon as he was strong again, accompanied by Martin, he travelled into Leyden, which now it was safe enough for him to visit, since the Spaniards were driven from the town.

302,313,"(CNN) -- A Russian bookmaking company is offering to pay 100,000 euros for Paul, the prognosticating octopus who correctly predicted Spain's win in the World Cup. 

""100,000 euros (about $129,800) was our starting price,"" Oleg Zhuravsky, co-owner of Liga Stavok -- ""Bet League"" in Russian -- told CNN. He said the offer could be increased if need be -- ""We are bookmakers, after all."" 

Paul currently lives at the Sea Life Center in Oberhausen, Germany. Zhuravsky said a representative of the center's public relations firm has told him the offer has been received and ""they are studying it."" 

However, the firm, Dederichs Reinecke and Parner, said it declined the Russian offer and that Paul will not be sold to anyone. 

""Seriously speaking, we want the octopus for a number of purposes,"" Zhuravsky said. ""First, to see whether he can indeed effectively forecast the results of the football games. Secondly, Paul could become a good mascot, a good symbol for my bookmaking companies. And thirdly, he has an international fame like perhaps no other animal across the world does these days, and I'd love to be able to move him to Russia. 

""Both kids and adults, I'm sure, would love to see him here,"" he said. ""We are even prepared to put him in the Moscow City Aquarium if that were the condition."" 

He said Paul would be given ""the best food"" and officials would let him forecast the results of the Russian domestic football tournament, ""which, I think, is a more difficult task than predicting the World Cup,"" he said.

He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react.

309,320,"Parents might tell older children to ""Act your age"". But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his words, if grown-ups really have superior brains, why don't we act as if we do? Q: What is a common saying that parents tell their kids? A: ""Act your age"". Q: Do scientists think it's accurate for parents to say this? A: yes. Q: Why do teens act immature when they appear to be grown up? A: Brain development continues into their twenties. Q: What area of the brain is still growing during this time? A: the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex. Q: What is its function? A: controls judgment and consideration of risk. Q: What behaviors show this lack of development? A: driving too fast.

They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his words, if grown-ups really have superior brains, why don't we act as if we do?",186,train

Marley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times.

Context: {} Q: {} A:","The Labrador has won the honor of the most popular breed for the past eighteen years. It has been described as gentle, clever and friendly. Yet not all Labs are the same. 

John Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, ""Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog."" 

Marley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. 

John Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible.

320,331,"ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- In 1989, the warnings were dire. The Spike Lee film ""Do the Right Thing,"" critics and columnists said, would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. 

Spike Lee: ""I wanted to do a film that would try to show what was happening at the time."" 

""This movie is dynamite under every seat,"" wrote Newsweek's Jack Kroll. 

Other commentators believed the film would harm the candidacy of David Dinkins, an African-American who was running for mayor of New York. It might even spark riots at movie theaters, they thought. 

Instead, what the film provoked was ... talk. There were no riots. Dinkins was elected. ""Do the Right Thing"" had a successful run at the box office -- if not as successful as Lee and his supporters hoped -- and was nominated for two Academy Awards. 

Twenty years later, the film still maintains a hold on the imagination. In 2007, the American Film Institute ranked it as one of the 100 best American films. Roger Ebert, who has written he cried when he first saw the film at the Cannes Film Festival, still considers the film a wonder: ""Spike Lee had done an almost impossible thing. He'd made a movie about race in America that empathized with all the participants,"" he wrote in 2001. 

So what is the thing about ""Do the Right Thing?"" Watch Spike Lee describe things in his own words » 

Part of its staying power is in its boldness, both in look and action. Lee's first two films, ""She's Gotta Have It"" (1986) and ""School Daze"" (1988), had marked him as a rising young filmmaker. But it was ""Do the Right Thing,"" made when Lee was just 32, that showcased his confidence, from the deliberately striking color scheme (bright reds and oranges that make a hot day seem even hotter) to its heightened -- sometimes stagy -- atmosphere, to its grim, documentary-style riot climax.  Q: Who created Do the Right Thing? A: Spike Lee. Q: When? A: 1989. Q: Why were newspaper writers concerned? A: they said it would provoke violence and disrupt race relations. Q: Were they right? A: no. Q: Was the movie successful? A: yes. Q: Was it nominated for any awards? A: yes. Q: Which one? A: two Academy Awards. Q: Who called the film a wonder? A: Roger Ebert.
