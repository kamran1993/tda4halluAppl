0,"Mother Josephine's parents fled to Taiwan from China with the retreating Nationalist party after it lost the civil war to the Communists in the late 1940s. They believed the Republic of China and mainland China were part of the same country and that is what she was taught.
Father Clyde worked for years at Taiwan's agency promoting trade, including with China. He and Mrs Wang believe Taiwan must have good relations with its biggest trade partner and former enemy, which wants Taiwan to be reunified one day. They don't support unification or independence, but maintaining the status quo.
But son Kevin, 30, strongly feels Taiwan is a separate country and must assert its independence or risk being swallowed up by China.
""My parents still think we are Chinese. In university I began doubting what I had been taught was correct,"" Kevin said. ""Now I believe Taiwan should be independent in all ways possible.
""The current government of the Republic of China in Taiwan is still inextricably tied to the concept that we are a part of China, so we need to cut the umbilical cord.""
People like Kevin have joined the so-called Sunflower Movement, which last year occupied parliament for 24 days sparking the largest anti-China demonstration in years.
They blocked the legislative approval of a controversial trade deal with China and forced the government to agree to a new law allowing more public oversight of negotiations with Beijing.
Though activities on the one-year anniversary in March were relatively small, and parliament is once again occupied by legislators, it's far from business as usual.
The movement has made many people feel that they, not just the government or ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party, should have a say in what kind of relationship Taiwan develops with China.
It has also contributed to a major defeat for the pro-China ruling party in November local elections. If it further fuels fears about China and dissatisfaction with the KMT, it could help the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) win next year's presidential race.
At the same time, it is pushing for reforms to Taiwan's referendum law to make it easier for referenda to pass.
Sunflower leaders say this will advance Taiwan's democratisation and safeguard its sovereignty by allowing the people to directly decide issues, including Taiwan's separate identity and relationship with China.
""If recognition of Taiwan's identity can be protected, then that will further Taiwan's self-rule. This is very important to us,"" said Sunflower leader Lin Fei-fan.
But not everyone supports the movement.
Though many deals have been signed with China in recent years, including some widely considered beneficial to Taiwan, would-be agreements are now on hold indefinitely.
This is causing concern from not only businesses such as banks that need greater access to China's market, but others who also believe it's crucial for the small island of Taiwan to have stronger ties with China, especially economic ones.
That includes Jen-Hsuan Hsieh, a recent university graduate. ""The whole world is trying to understand China. We should do the same,"" she said.
""Even if you consider it your enemy, you should still understand your enemy well.""
A freelance interpreter, she is looking for work in China, where the opportunities are greater and wages higher.
She's not alone. A recent survey showed about one third of Taiwanese in their 20s and 30s want to work in China; more than in previous years.
That raises the question of whether time is on China's side or Taiwan's.
With time, Taiwan's economy and people's livelihoods may become more interlinked with China, making it easier for Beijing to push for unification.
But with time, Taiwanese people could grow even more adamant about the island's separate entity. A survey conducted late last year by the local China Youth Corps found nearly 90% of junior and senior-high school students regarded themselves as Taiwanese, rather than Chinese.
Some suggest that if China becomes democratic, and its average living standard reaches Taiwan's level, differences between the two sides will be blurred, and if its people understand more about Taiwan with time, their views about unification may weaken, making such a debate unnecessary.
For now, Beijing is watching the Sunflower Movement closely. However, it may be unsure how to react, partly because it's no longer about dealing with one political party versus another, but many civic groups and individuals driving the movement.
So far, it has mainly suggested reaching out to Taiwan's young people.
Back at the Wang home, the family avoid discussing the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty or Kevin's part in the movement until they are asked. But it's clear he wants to become more involved.
""Maintaining the status quo will inevitably mean reunification with China. What a lot of people in our generation are pushing for right now is de jure independence, formal independence,"" he said.
His parents accept that his generation will ultimately decide their society's future; they just hope it makes the right decisions.
""We don't know what's going to happen in a couple more generations,"" said his father, Clyde. ""I don't think it's a good idea to antagonise China and to provoke war across the strait.""
""What I like to see happen in the future is eventually this historical problem will be solved in a very peaceful way.""",Breakfast at the Wangs' on a Sunday: it's a lesson in how attitudes in Taiwan towards China have changed significantly in just three generations.,32157210,"The Sunflower Movement in Taiwan, a pro-democracy and pro-independence movement, has gained momentum in recent years as younger generations push for greater say in Taiwan's relationship with China, with some advocating for formal independence and others seeking to maintain the status quo; the movement has contributed to a major defeat for the pro-China ruling party in local elections and could potentially help the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party win the presidential race in 2020.",1,"Article: {}

2,"That's the verdict of scientists who have analysed ancient DNA of the extinct animals for mutations.
The studies suggest the last mammoths died out after their DNA became riddled with errors.
The knowledge could inform conservation efforts for living animals.
There are fewer than 100 Asiatic cheetahs left in the wild, while the remaining mountain gorilla population is estimated at about 300. The numbers are similar to those of the last woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean around 4,000 years ago.
Dr Rebekah Rogers of the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research, said the mammoths' genomes ""were falling apart right before they went extinct"".
This, she said, was the first case of ""genomic meltdown"" in a single species.
""You had this last refuge of mammoths after everything has gone extinct on the mainland,"" she added.
""The mathematical theories that have been developed said that they should accumulate bad mutations because natural selection should become very inefficient.""
The researchers analysed genetic mutations found in the ancient DNA of a mammoth from 4,000 years ago. They used the DNA of a mammoth that lived about 45,000 years ago, when populations were much larger,  as a comparison.
Woolly mammoths were once common in North America and Siberia. They were driven to extinction by environmental factors and possibly human hunting about 10,000 years ago. Small island populations clung on until about 4,000 years ago.
""There was this huge excess of what looked like bad mutations in the genome of the mammoth from this island,"" said Dr Rogers.
""We found these bad mutations were accumulating in the mammoth genome right before they went extinct.""
Knowledge of the last days of the mammoth could help modern species on the brink of extinction, such as the panda, mountain gorilla and Indian elephant. The lesson from the woolly mammoth is that once numbers drop below a certain level, the population's genetic health may be beyond saving. Genetic testing could be one way to assess whether levels of genetic diversity in a species are enough to give it a chance of survival. A better option is to stop numbers falling too low.
""When you have these small populations for an extended period of time they can go into genomic meltdown, just like what we saw in the mammoth,"" said Dr Rogers.
""So if you can prevent these organisms ever being threatened or endangered then that will do a lot more to help prevent this type of genomic meltdown compared to if you have a small population and then bring it back up to larger numbers because it will still bear those signatures of this genomic meltdown.""
Scientists think the genetic mutations may have given the last woolly mammoths ""silky, shiny satin fur"". Mutations may have also led to a loss of olfactory receptors, responsible for the sense of smell, as well as substances in urine involved in social status and attracting a mate.
Love Dalen is professor of evolutionary genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and head of the team of scientists that originally published the DNA sequences of the mammoths.
He said they found ""many deletions, big chunks of the genome that are missing, some of which even affected functional genes"".
""This is a very novel result,"" he said. ""If this holds up when more mammoth genomes, as well as genomes from other species, are analysed, it will have very important implications for conservation biology.""
The research is published in the journal, PLOS Genetics.

3,"The price of Brent crude fell to $27.67 a barrel at one point, its lowest since 2003, while US crude fell as low as $28.36.
Many analysts have slashed their 2016 oil price forecasts, with Morgan Stanley analysts saying that ""oil in the $20s is possible"", if China devalues its currency further.
Economists at the Royal Bank of Scotland say that oil could fall to $16, while Standard Chartered predicts that prices could hit just $10 a barrel.
What are the factors have caused the price to sink below $30 a barrel - and what could spark a recovery?
In a nutshell, it's down to too much supply and too little demand.
China's economic slowdown has curbed appetite for commodities in general, while Saudi Arabia, which produces a third of the Opec cartel's output, is keener on preserving its market share than it is on cutting production to boost prices.
At the same time, the rise of the US as a shale oil producer means it now imports less oil, adding to the glut on world markets.
This makes life harder for other non-US, non-Opec producers, who are facing cutbacks, particularly in the North Sea.
Big oil companies such as BP, Shell, Total and Exxon Mobil have weathered the storm by cutting back on billions of pounds of investment, and thousands of jobs have been cut.
However, Jeremy Batstone-Carr, chief economist at Charles Stanley, warns that further price falls could really start hurting the big firms.
The first clue that they are starting to suffer, he suggests, will be cutting dividend payments to investors - something they have avoided so far.
Meanwhile, Alan Gelder, of oil analysts Wood Mackenzie, says many North Sea oil operators are ""beginning to really feel the pain"" at current prices.
He says firms can just about survive as many North Sea operators have already cut costs. But Mr Gelder warns that ""there is no money left for future investment"".
Paul Stevens, professor emeritus at the University of Dundee, and a Middle East specialist, says the price of oil could theoretically fall to as little as $20 to $25 per barrel.
Why? It may be an unusual view but he thinks most US shale oil producers can tolerate current oil prices.
They may make a small loss - he estimates the cost of production at about $40 a barrel for shale producers - but until the price falls to around $25 a barrel they will keep producing, Prof Stevens says.
Mr Gelder, however, does not think many US shale operators can continue production with prices below $50.
""There are some sweet spots in the US where some operators are able to keep production going at lower levels, but it's not economic at under $30,"" he says.
There is also another much bigger problem than the future of fracking in the US.
""An awful lot of oil producers can't survive at these levels,"" Mr Gelder says. ""Venezuela, Algeria, Nigeria are facing serious financial problems and political unrest with people out of work and prices rising.""
There is so much oversupply globally that countries are running out of storage. The US, which is thought to have among the largest storage facilities in the world, has nowhere left to keep it, says Prof Stevens. And it's not the only country.
""Storage is pretty much full and people are already talking about buying tankers as floating storage,"" he says. ""But if supply continues to outstrip demand, then the only thing that you can do with the oil is sell it, which inevitably pushes the price down.""
Mr Gelder takes a different view, suggesting it is not entirely clear whether US storage is completely full. ""We know about US and European storage levels, but India and China are strategically storing oil for supply disruptions.""
Mr Batstone-Carr adds:  ""Without a marked reduction in output nothing will change, and we have to wait until June for the next Opec meeting before we might see a reduction in quotas. And all of this comes at a time when economic activity is on the back foot, signalling there's not a lot of demand out there.""
Professor Stevens warns that the collapse in prices is the result of oil being ""freely traded for the first time since 1928"".
That, he says, is because Saudi Arabia has decided not to cut production to support prices - unlike during previous oil gluts.
It is just over four years since the US imposed sanctions on oil imports from Iran, helping to bolster prices and allowing Saudi Arabia to grab market share that it is now very reluctant to surrender.
A report from Wood Mackenzie says that the Saudis would not cut output to make room for Iran, which could begin exporting oil in the next few weeks, according to some sources.
""Unless other producers such as Russia, Iran and Iraq agree to reduce their oil production, Saudi Arabia has consistently stated since the November 2014 Opec meeting, it has no intention of cutting its supply to support oil prices,"" the report says.
""The current ramping up in tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran only further confirms our view that Saudi Arabia is unlikely to cut its output to help Iran regain market share.""
Prof Stevens says tensions in the Middle East are ""as high as you could have them without having outright war. I don't think things have been as bad since 1918 and the fall of the Ottoman Empire.""
Such uncertainty normally sparks an oil price spike. But apart from a rise over the New Year, prices have continued to slide.
Mr Gelder says most oil traders shrugged off the possibility of Saudi Arabia and Iran squaring up to one another in a way that could seriously affect supplies.
And with demand for oil weakening, especially in China and emerging markets, there seems little reason to expect that prices are set to rise any time soon.
It means lower petrol prices, although what you pay at the pump may not fully reflect the oil price drop. Bear in mind that excise duty and VAT make up nearly 60% of the price of a litre, and that isn't coming down any time soon.
Obviously if people are spending less at the forecourt, they have more money to allocate elsewhere, and that is a potential boost to the economy.
However, if petrol-driven cars cost less to run, that means there's less incentive to invest in alternatives, such as electric vehicles, so in the long run, low petrol prices could be bad for the environment.

The board is debating whether to suspend the entire Russian team from the Games following a doping scandal.
""I apologise unreservedly for any offence I have caused. I am truly sorry,"" Franco Kasper said.
The International Ski Federation President was discussing a proposed blanket ban on Russian athletes when he made the Holocaust comment, referring to the World War II genocide that saw six million Jews killed by Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany.
He reportedly said: ""I'm just against bans or sanctioning of innocent people. Like Mr Hitler did - all Jews were to be killed, independently of what they did or did not do.""

UK officials said the bill for policing the embassy, which stands at £12m ($18.8m; €16.8m), was ""unacceptable"".
Earlier, Swedish prosecutors dropped two sex assault claims against Mr Assange, who had denied the claims.
Mr Assange still faces the more serious accusation of rape, which he also denies.

Mr Swire said the UK ""continues to have a legal obligation"" to extradite Mr Assange over the rape allegation.

Julian Assange profile
Mr Assange sought asylum three years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden, fearing he would then be sent to the US and put on trial for releasing secret American documents.
The UK has paid for policing around the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, for the past three years.
The formal protest comes after Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation into an allegation of sexual molestation and an accusation of unlawful coercion against Mr Assange because they ran out of time to question him.
An additional alleged incident of sexual molestation will be ""time barred"" - that is, time will run out to question Mr Assange - on 18 August.
The Swedish statement also said an allegation of rape was due to expire on 17 August 2020, but that investigation would continue.
The alleged events took place in August 2010.
Mr Assange said he was ""extremely disappointed"", adding the Swedish prosecutor had avoided hearing his side of the story.
Under Swedish law, charges cannot be laid without interviewing the suspect.
""There was no need for any of this. I am an innocent man. I haven't even been charged,"" said Mr Assange.
""From the beginning I offered simple solutions. Come to the embassy to take my statement or promise not to send me to the United States. This Swedish official refused both. She even refused a written statement.""
However, Sweden's director of public prosecution said a request to interview Mr Assange inside the embassy had been submitted but permission was yet to be granted.
Marianne Nye said she still hoped to arrange an interview as there were ""ongoing negotiations"" between Sweden and Ecuador.
One of Mr Assange's lawyers, Helena Kennedy, said: ""Julian Assange has spent more time incarcerated in the small rooms of the embassy, with no access to fresh air or exercise and contrary to international law, than he could ever spend in a Swedish prison on these allegations.""

7,"The UK could also be allowed to keep many of its trade terms with the EU so as to avoid disruption, Moody's said.
The report shows economic warnings from pro-EU groups have been ""baseless scaremongering"", Vote Leave said.
But the Britain Stronger in Europe group said it was further evidence that leaving would damage the economy.
The Moody's report comes after the CBI warned a British exit from the EU - known as a ""Brexit"" - could cost the UK economy Â£100bn and nearly one million jobs.
A vote to leave in the 23 June referendum would create significant uncertainty that would hamper economic growth, according to Moody's.
But the ratings agency said this would be partly offset by a decline in the pound - making UK exports more competitive - and by companies having time to adjust during UK-EU negotiations that it expects to last for at least two years.
""Our central view is that the negative economic impact of Brexit would be relatively small,"" the credit agency said.
As a result, Moody's would ""not expect to see significant increases in unemployment or [interest] rates, or substantial declines in property prices across the UK as a whole"".
Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said of the report: ""The UK will not face trade barriers after we Vote Leave, jobs will be safe and our credit rating will not be affected.""
However, Lucy Thomas, deputy director of Stronger In Europe, said: ""By leaving, we would unavoidably end up with worse trade terms. That would hit British industries such as car makers and financial services, putting jobs, low prices and financial security at risk for British people.
""Until the Leave campaigns can specify exactly how they would avoid that, going out on our own is a risk we can't afford to take.""
No trade deal would be as good as the one the UK currently has, she added.
Moody's said: ""We expect that, over time, the UK and EU would come to an arrangement to preserve most - but probably not all - of the current trading relationships, thereby limiting the impact on UK exporters and supply chains of UK importers.""
This is because both the UK and EU would want to avoid large-scale disruption, it said.
The ratings agency also pointed to HSBC's recent decision to keep its headquarters in London as evidence the capital would still be an attractive home for financial services firms.
""Although there are clear downside risks to the City of London's standing as a global financial centre, in our central scenario we do not see Brexit materially damaging its strong position,"" it said.
Gas, electricity, water and broadband networks would see ""little"" impact from a Leave vote, despite the UK having to replace existing EU regulations.

8,"They made the connection on an expedition to the boy's village, Meliandou.
They took samples and chatted to locals to find out more about Ebola's source.
The team's findings are published in EMBO Molecular Medicine.
Meliandou is a small village of 31 houses.
It sits deep within the Guinean forest region, surrounded by towering reeds and oil palm cultivations - these are believed to have attracted the fruit bats carrying the virus passed on to Emile.
During their four-week field trip in April 2014, Dr Fabian Leendertz and colleagues found a large tree stump situated about 50m from Emile's home.
Villagers reported that children used to play frequently in the hollow tree.
Emile - who died of Ebola in December 2013 - used to play there, according to his friends.
The villagers said that the tree burned on March 24, 2014 and that once the tree caught fire, there issued a ""rain of bats"".
A large number of these insectivorous free-tailed bats - Mops condylurus in Latin - were collected by the villagers for food, but disposed of the next day after a government-led ban on bushmeat consumption was announced.
While bushmeat is thought to be a possible source of Ebola, the scientists believe it didn't trigger the outbreak.
Instead, it was Emile's exposure to the bats and their droppings as he played with his friends in the hollowed tree.
The scientists took and tested ash samples from the tree and found DNA traces that were a match for the animals.
While they were unable to test any of the bushmeat that the villagers had disposed of, they captured and tested any living bats they could find in and around Meliandou.
No Ebola could be detected in any of these hundred or so animals, however.
But previous tests show this species of bat can carry Ebola.
Dr Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and his colleagues say this must be a pretty rare occurrence though.
Dr Leendertz said: ""That is also obvious when you think about how many tonnes of bat meat is consumed every year.
""If more bats carried the virus, we would see outbreaks all the time.""
He says it is vital to find out more about the bats.
""They have moved into human settlements. They do not just live in the trees but also under the roofs of houses in the villages.
""The Ebola virus must jump through colonies from bat to bat, so we need to know more.""
But culling the animals is not the answer.
""We need to find ways to live together with the wildlife. These bats catch insects and pests, such as mosquitoes. They can eat about a quarter of their body weight in insects a day.

Draper put the Welsh champions ahead after 24 minutes only for Stuart Malcolm to reply after the break against the run of play.
Forfar were on top after the break, but two Draper strikes won the tie.
The Welsh side who started their season in the Champions League qualifiers came to Forfar in confident form with 11 straight wins behind them and they looked the more imposing side in the opening 20 minutes.
Alex Darlington, who had scored both goals in a midweek domestic win, had the first opportunity of the match, but goalkeeper Grant Adam got down smartly to save his 20-yard effort.
TNS wasted another chance as Aeron Edwards came into the box unmarked to meet a corner but sent his header back across goal and off-target.
The Welsh side were dominating possession and the Scottish League Two leaders were struggling to link with Jim Lister and Josh Peters, who were trying to provide an attacking threat.
TNS took the lead after 23 minutes, but it was tinged by controversy.
Forfar were convinced they had won a corner, but a goal-kick was awarded that was swiftly taken and a defensive mis-header found its way to  Draper, who controlled the ball and slipped it beyond Adam.
TNS wasted two further chances to add to their lead before Forfar hit back.
Peters forced a save from Paul Harrison in the TNS goal, but from the resultant corner, Malcolm powered a header in off the bar.
Control switched to Forfar after the break as the home side enjoyed better possession and created the better opportunities.
Jim Lister was twice denied in the same move, with Phil Baker blocking his second effort, while goalkeeper Paul Harrison produced a fingertip save to deny Jamie Bain.
Forfar continued to press and a powerful Martyn Fotheringham free-kick just finished the wrong side of the post.
TNS had shown little in an attacking sense in the second half had the inspiration of substitute Robbie Parry to thank for the goal that put them ahead.
He finished his run into the box by shooting past Adam and Draper netted.

16,"With all the walking, running, cycling and gym activity you intend to do, obviously you need an activity tracker -a small, trusty device that you can wear 24/7 to monitor every footstep, every mile clocked up, every calorie burned, and even the quality of every moment's shuteye.
You'll believe what it says. I mean, why wouldn't you?
Millions of these things have been sold, and you're not exactly going to buy multiple devices to check they come up with the same results.
And that's why I felt compelled to carry out this experiment for you.
I've spent a full week wearing four of the latest and best-known trackers to see if they all came up with the same results.
My findings? They don't. This isn't about which device presents your text messages to you, or comes in three shades of pink, but about cold, hard data.
The Garmin Vivosmart, Fitbit Charge, Misfit Shine and Jawbone Up Move are all in the dock.
At their worst, one day saw a variation between them of 23% in distance covered, and over the course of a week a difference in opinion between the Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up Move of 2,649 calories burned - that's more than an entire day's calorie intake for someone of my build.
Both companies are united in saying that it's not the figures that matter, but the pattern.
Managing director of Fitbit Europe Gareth Jones advises people to simply be aware of the trend.
""Rather than get down to the half step or the next calorie is to look at the trend in their step pattern,"" he says,
""Are they increasing the number of steps in their day all week? Are they increasing the calorie burn day to day, week to week? Because it's that trend that's going to make you healthier.""
It's a sentiment echoed by Jawbone's head of international partner and product development, Jorgen Nordin.
""What's important really is that our system is all about getting better, becoming a better version of yourself,"" he says.
And maybe there is something in that.
Goodwill, good intention, motivation to improve your lifestyle and upping your own activity may become so enshrined in this new active tracked you that you transform your entire being.
Yet rely too much on the tech, inviting in third-party apps, inputting what you've eaten, and taking the figures as gospel, and you may just find it all going the wrong way.
But, surely buying a device is buying into the idea that precise data matters to you?
Well, Misfit's medical director Matthew Diamond explains it's not an exact science.
""Variations in algorithms, the sensors used, the characteristics of the individual wearing the device, like height and gait, as well as wearing position, can result in observed differences,"" he says.
That's not dissimilar to Mr Jones's view - he puts inaccuracies down in part to the lack of a standardised algorithm.
Yet it is acknowledged that trackers that incorporate heart-rate monitoring sensors offer better calorie burn accuracy, which could be interpreted as a nod to the fact they need to.
""Garmin's activity trackers are all about motivation, nudging the user to make healthier choices,"" says Chrissy Winchcombe, Garmin's marketing executive of wellness.
""You can also use it with a heart-rate monitor for more accurate calorie counting when exercising.""
Right now it feels as though a new device is launched weekly, some with looks to replicate mere watches. Others, like the Swarovski crystal, solar-powered Misfit - tracking abilities aside - would put J-Lo's bling to shame.
But providing stats and prompting ""do more exercise"" notifications are just the start of their makers' ambitions.
""With wearables and looking at the Jawbone band, you know so much about the individual that you can actually start using that information to make the internet of things more like the internet of you,"" says Jawbone's Jorgen Nordin.
""For example, you've been out running, you come home. Your house knows you've been running, not just because of the temperature of your skin, but it also knows you've been sweating based on sensors.
""Based on that information your stereo system could be playing some cool jazz to cool you down. Your Nest thermostat can cool down the house to help you get cooler.
""If you're in a house with a boiler connected to your shower, that could be turned on as you walk into your house.""
Mr Nordin has connected his Jawbone UP to turn his coffee machine on as soon as he wakes.
For most of us though, the simple question now is more likely to be: ""Is it still worth me wearing an activity tracker then?""
Sensors are still improving, and as we've seen, we can't expect military precision, but this is a personal choice.
Will I be laying mine to rest? No chance.
It makes me think more about my activity. It makes me walk instead of getting the bus.
It makes me feel smug at the end of the day (usually).
My husband I can compete over footsteps - don't worry, we have the same device.

17,"Rather amusingly, it's because the word ""patience"" was removed from the statement. Of course, it depends on how far the US labour market improves since inflation isn't an issue, so the jobs market looms larger for the US central bank with its dual mandate to address unemployment and inflation.
Still, looking at the forecasts of the individual rate setters, the median projection is for the interest rate to end the year at 0.625%, so that's a rate rise from the current 0-0.25%.
Markets were expecting this, which helps. Stocks rallied in part because the rate raise may not be very soon, as the US economy is weaker than the rate setters thought back in December. The key forecasts for the economy and inflation were all downgraded. Now, the US economy is expected to grow by 2.3-2.7% versus a top growth rate of 3% in the December forecasts. Inflation is also expected to be below the Fed's 2% target through 2016 when it may hover between 1.5-1.9%.
No repeat history
Indeed, investors don't like to be surprised, so part of what the Fed has to do is to manage expectations. And one of the concerns that's percolating right now is whether Fed raising rates or tightening could result in a repeat of the 1930's.
The period between 1937-1938 is known as a recession within a recession. It's when the US fell back into recession eight years after the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression. It happened after four years of cash printing, which pushed up stock prices.
In 1936, the Fed started to worry about its ""exit strategy"". When it started to tighten the money supply in 1937, it coincided with the end of a fiscal stimulus that reduced the budget deficit by some 2.5% of GDP. Unemployment soared again to 19% after falling to 14% from 25%, and the Dow Jones lost around one-third of its value during the sharp economic slump of 1937-38.
If it all sounds too familiar for comfort, that's why some are concerned about the Fed's move toward ""normalising"" interest rates, as it moves rates above 0% and back to pre-crisis levels. The last rate hike was eight years ago in 2007 and it's been at rock bottom pretty much since the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing recession dubbed the Great Recession.
It shouldn't be surprising that the Fed will contemplate raising rates as it has been a long recovery. The delicate part is to manage expectations. But more than that, it's also ensuring that the economy is on a solid enough footing to normalise interest rates.
Acting prematurely could cause the Great Recession to truly parallel the Great Depression.
With growth and inflation both downgraded, but unemployment moving in the right direction, judging what ""premature"" means is no easy task. And communicating it to investors will also be crucial.",The Federal Reserve's latest statement suggests that the path is clear for an interest rate rise in June or September without surprising markets.,31954809,"The Federal Reserve is expected to raise interest rates later in 2016, but the timing and pace of these increases will depend on how the US labor market improves and how much inflation pressures build, with the central bank aiming to manage expectations and avoid a repeat of the 1930s, when the Fed's actions led to a recession within a recession.",1,"Article: {}

The PM said Fifa could only rebuild its credibility if Mr Blatter left.
It comes as the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it was looking at material relating to the allegations.
Seven senior Fifa officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on Wednesday.
The US Justice Department (DOJ) has charged 14 people with racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.
Mr Cameron's comments followed Mr Blatter's call for unity at Fifa as delegates prepare to vote on his presidency.
Mr Blatter, who is expected to win a fifth term, said: ""I am appealing to unity and team spirit so we can move forward together.""
But speaking in Berlin, Mr Cameron said: ""You cannot have accusations of corruption at this level and on this scale in this organisation and pretend that the person currently leading it is the right person to take it forward.
""That cannot be the case. Frankly, what we've seen is the ugly side of the beautiful game and he should go.
""And the sooner that happens the better - the faster that organisation can start to rebuild its credibility, which is going to be so important because so many people around the world want to see this game properly managed, properly looked after, so we can all enjoy the World Cups of the future.""
Mr Cameron, who is holding EU reform talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said it was ""unthinkable"" that Mr Blatter should stay.
He also said he would be ""guided"" by the Football Association (FA) chairman, Greg Dyke, over the question of whether the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be opened.
Mr Dyke suggested earlier that he would not rule out a boycott of the major football tournaments if Mr Blatter remains at the helm of Fifa.
The Union of European Football Associations (Uefa), Europe's governing body, may consider boycotting future World Cups if Mr Blatter wins Friday's vote, according to Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan.
Meanwhile, the SFO said it was actively assessing ""material in its possession"" relating to Fifa corruption allegations.
It said it had ""made plain that it stands ready to assist ongoing international criminal investigations"".
It said its probe had been ongoing for months, before Wednesday's indictments.
Despite a global media and sporting storm, Fifa president Sepp Blatter is seeking re-election for a fifth term, with the only challenge coming from Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.
The vote is taking place at the Fifa World Congress meeting in Zurich, Switzerland.
The SFO said it was not willing to comment further on the nature of material in its possession or current activity in this area.
It added that it had not launched a formal criminal investigation.  But it said there were two ways in which it could get involved - if the SFO opened a formal criminal investigation itself or provided ""mutual legal assistance"" to overseas law enforcement.
It also says it has made plain to both US and Swiss authorities that it stands ready to assist.
""There are currently international criminal investigations into allegations of corruption at Fifa. As such it would be inappropriate for the SFO to comment on the matter at this time,"" it said.
In November the SFO asked for anyone with information regarding alleged corruption in the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to come forward.

The society said the impact of political leaders had been ""minimal"".
It called for a ""root and branch"" review of the way referendums are run.
Recommendations made by the society in its report include having a public body intervene when ""misleading"" claims are made by campaigns, reviewing broadcasters' role and publishing a ""rule book"" to govern conduct by campaigns.
They also propose that future referendums have a guaranteed six month official campaign, and citizenship education be extended in schools with the voting age reduced to 16.
The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June by 51.9% to 48.1%.
The then prime minister David Cameron and the government backed a Remain vote, while the Leave campaign was fronted by ex-mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is now foreign secretary.
The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for ""democratic reform"", said its polling showed Mr Cameron and other political ""big beasts"" had failed to convince the public.
When asked about eight prominent politicians, most people said they had had no effect on the way they voted.
The only high-profile figures who, according to the poll, persuaded more voters of their position than drove them to vote the other way were Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who backed Brexit.
""Above all, what these numbers tell us is that people had by and large lost faith in established political figures as opinion-leaders - except where those figures might be said to be kicking against the establishment,"" the society said.
It said voters had viewed both sides as increasingly negative, and many ""simply did not trust"" their key claims. These included Remain saying households would be on average Â£4,300 a year worse off outside the EU and Leave claiming an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS.
The government's controversial mail-shot to every household in the UK had ""little effect on people's levels of informedness"", it said, and towards the end of the campaign nearly half of voters thought politicians were ""mostly telling lies"".
The society said the EU debate was in ""stark contrast"" to the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, which it said had featured a ""vibrant, well-informed, grassroots conversation that left a lasting legacy of on-going public participation in politics and public life"".
The society's chief executive Katie Ghose said: ""This report shows without a shadow of a doubt just how dire the EU referendum debate really was.
""There were glaring democratic deficiencies in the run-up to the vote, with the public feeling totally ill-informed. Both sides were viewed as highly negative by voters, while the top-down, personality-based nature of the debate failed to address major policies and issues, leaving the public in the dark.""
On the plus side, the society said it had heard ""time and again"" from people who felt the referendum was the first time their vote ""had truly counted"".
But it said there were ""serious questions"" to be asked about the place of referendums in politics, including how they sit alongside the parliamentary system and how to ensure a ""high quality"" debate.
Ms Ghose added: ""Now that the dust is starting to settle after the EU referendum, we need a complete rethink about the role of referendums in the UK. They are becoming more common, but the piecemeal nature of the how, when and why they're done means we could simply end up jumping from referendum to referendum at the whim of politicians.""
BMG Research polled over 1,000 UK-based adults every month from February until the end of the campaign for the Electoral Reform Society's report.
The Cabinet Office said: ""The British people spoke decisively at the referendum, with one of the highest turnouts of any vote seen in a UK-wide poll in a generation.

26,"One of the few women to receive a mention is Marie Curie, a physicist and chemist who basically discovered radiation and helped apply it in the field of X-rays.
She won two Nobel Prizes, in physics and chemistry. Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize.
The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community.
The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964.
Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as ""Oxford housewife wins Nobel"".
But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness.
Here are just a few.
Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics.
She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work.
Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award.
The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer.
Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work.
Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics.
It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table.
She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium.
But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre.
Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory.
Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission.
Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two.
This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb.
After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades.
But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author.
And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom.
Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century.
She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today.
In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head.
This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played.
Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe.
She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women.
Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth.
This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness.
The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president.
It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke.
Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation.
Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity.
It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women.
That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.","A quick web search for the world's most famous scientists lists, among others, Galileo, Einstein, Newton, Darwin, Stephen Hawking and Alexander Fleming.",33157396,"The article highlights the historical marginalization and exclusion of women from the scientific community, with several notable female scientists being overlooked or undervalued for their contributions, including Marie Curie, Dorothy Hodgkin, Esther Lederberg, Rosalind Franklin, Ida Tacke, Lise Meitner, Chien-Shiung Wu, and Henrietta Leavitt, among others.",0,"Article: {}

The credibility of records was examined following the sport's doping scandal.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, called the proposals ""cowardly"".
""I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity,"" she said, adding that the governing bodies had ""again failed clean athletes"".
Svein Arne Hansen, the European Athletics president, said world records ""are meaningless if people don't really believe them"".
However, Radcliffe said the changes were ""heavy handed"" and ""confusing to the public"".
European Athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records in January. Its ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants the sport's world governing body, the IAAF, to adopt the changes it sets out.
Media playback is not supported on this device
If the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria:
The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an ""all-time list"", but not be officially recognised as records.
This would include Jonathan Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Colin Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon mark of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers.
Mary Keitany of Kenya broke Radcliffe's women's-only world record to win the 2017 London Marathon in two hours 17 minutes one second, the second-fastest time in history.
The council also recommended that a performance should be wiped from record books if the athlete had committed a ""doping or integrity violation, even if it does not directly impact the record performance"".
The proposals are a response to last year's McLaren report, which uncovered widespread doping in sport - and athletics in particular. Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition unless they can satisfy strict criteria to show they are clean.
More than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples.
""There are records in which people in the sport, the media and the public do not have complete confidence,"" added taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.
IAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were ""a step in the right direction"".
""There will be athletes, current record holders, who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them, but if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area,"" he said.
European Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting.
""What we are proposing is revolutionary and not just because most world and European records will have to be replaced,"" Hansen added.
""We want to raise the standards for recognition to a point where everyone can be confident that everything is fair and above board.""
Radcliffe has previously criticised plans to wipe records from the books and last month told BBC Sport she favoured making doping a criminal offence instead to deter cheats.
She issued a statement on Monday criticising the new proposals and athletics governing bodies.
""I worked extremely hard for my PBs and they will always be valid to me. I know they were set through hard work and best effort and abiding by all the rules and am proud of them,"" Radcliffe wrote.
""Governing bodies have a duty to protect every clean athlete, here they again fail those athletes. We had to compete against cheats, they couldn't provide us a level playing field, we lost out on medals, moments and earnings due to cheats, saw our sport dragged through the mud due to cheats and now, thanks to those who cheat we potentially lose our World and Area records.
""Although we are moving forward I don't believe we are yet at the point where we have a testing procedure capable of catching every cheat out there, so why reset at this point? Do we really believe a record set in 2015 is totally clean and one in 1995 not?
""I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity. It is a heavy handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted.

Speaking to the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Coburn denied Mr Woolfe's claim that UKIP was in a ""death spiral"" and had become ungovernable.
He said the incident between Mr Woolfe and Mr Hookem had been ""regrettable"" but had involved only two people rather than the whole party.
Mr Woolfe has stood by his claim that he ""received a blow"" from Mr Hookem, though this has been denied by Mr Hookem.
Mr Coburn said: ""I keep saying it is country, party and self last. It is ideas that count, not individuals. What we are looking for is an agenda for the future, we are publishing it now and that is how we are moving forward.

""Now what you have got is you've got to choose a new leader. In that, you've lifted the lid off things a bit and it bubbles over.""

He said he wanted to ensure the country was run ""in the interests of the people not in the interests of big business or trade unions"" and that he had joined UKIP because he wanted ""radical change"" to the way the country was governed, not just because he wanted to leave the EU.
And he said he would ""certainly not"" be supporting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's attempts to keep Scotland in the EU single market after Brexit.
Mr Coburn insisted: ""We decided during the Scottish referendum on independence that we are part of the United Kingdom and in terms of that we voted in the European referendum, that was as a United Kingdom.

39,"Payments have been stopped to the West London Vocational Training College and its students in the Welsh capital.
Education Minister Huw Lewis said there were concerns over ""unusual student recruitment trends"".
The college said as far as it is concerned, all of its students are genuine.
The Cardiff branch runs various IT and business courses and has been designated as suitable to offer HND business courses, which attract tuition fees of Â£6,000 per student, funded by the Welsh government.
Students on those courses can also apply for Student Finance Wales loans and grants.
Week In Week Out has been investigating offers made by a local agent recruiting for the college.
Some students have been told by him they can use faked documents to access those loans and grants and they do not have to attend regularly to get the cash.
He also said if they do not go on to earn more than Â£21,000, they will not have to repay the money - which is true.
The college has denied any knowledge of that scam.
In a statement to AMs on Friday, Mr Lewis said: ""Allegations have since come to light to suggest that one or more individuals within the college may have colluded with prospective students deliberately to defraud the student finance system by falsifying academic records and records of attendance at the college.
""I would expect any allegations of criminal activity to be referred to the police so that they may be investigated fully.""

And Van Gogh's atmospheric landscape, Paysage sous un ciel mouvemente, sold for $54m (£36m), helping to take the evening's total to $306.7m (£203m).
Simon Shaw, co-head of Impressionist and modern art worldwide, called it ""a small sale that packed a real punch"".
He added: ""Each season Picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two Blue Period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper.""
La Gommeuse, described as most the important blue period Picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901.
The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into English as 'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs.
It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work.
The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Manach was apparently intended as a gift for the Catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris.
The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers.
At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by Asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons.
The $306.7m (£202m) total comfortably beat the $275m (£182m) low pre-sale estimate. Sotheby's had tagged the high estimate at about $370m (£244.5m).
This total brings Sotheby's sales of Impressionist & Modern Art in just the past 24 hours to $575.8m (£381m),

Penalty notices totalling more than Â£385,000 which were given to 12,000 drivers in Coppergate were refunded after the council abandoned the scheme in 2014, less than a year after it was introduced.

Her family believed they had met the requirements of her visa, which expires later this month.
Immigration officials said they had been working with the family and made no arrangements to remove Mrs Grant.
However, the grandmother's family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that they had not found Australia's immigration department helpful and had gone to specialists for assistance.
They could apply for a new visa but were told that this could take 30 years to resolve.
The Grant family had hoped that because of her age and state of her heath that her situation might be treated a special case.
Mrs Grant's surviving son Allan and his wife Diane believe they have done everything to meet the rules of her visa after she moved to live with them in Australia.
Mrs Grant is booked on a flight back to the UK on 26 July, the date her visitor visa expires.
Her family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the alternatives were the possibility of deportation or ""years of limbo"" while trying to obtain a new visa.
Mrs Grant, who is partially sighted and has dementia, was living near Grantown on Spey in the Highlands.
Her son Robert had been helping to look after her.
Because of the state of her health, Allan and Diane asked her to move to Australia and live with them.
They applied for a visa for her to come to Australia.
A condition of her visa was that she had to depart Australia once every 12 months but could return.
Concerned that Mrs Grant was not fit enough to fly out of Australia to meet this requirement, her family booked her on a cruise to Vanuatu, a group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean.
They believed that this trip would meet the visa requirements.
However, after the cruise the Grants were told by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that the visa rules had not been met.
Diane told Good Morning Scotland that immigration specialists had told the family that applying for a new visa could take up to 30 years to come through.
They are now preparing to fly with Mrs Grant back to Scotland.
Diane said: ""We will have to help her find a home over there.
""We have our own life here in Australia and, while I don't want to live there, Mum wants to live here.""
The Grants have highlighted their case in an effort to alert other families that may find themselves in the same situation.

It is thought Islamist militant group Boko Haram took the girls to forested areas near the Cameroonian border.
The group is waging a bloody campaign for an Islamic state in northern Nigeria.
Nigerian students living in fear
What is Nigeria's Boko Haram?
Also on Wednesday, 18 people were killed in an attack in the Gwoza district of north-eastern Nigeria, local officials told the AP news agency.
The BBC's correspondent in Lagos, Will Ross, says the Nigerian military's statement that most of the girls had escaped their captors contrasts sharply with other information available to the BBC, including the claims of parents of pupils at the school. They insist ""many"" of their children are still missing.
The raid on the boarding school is a great source of embarrassment for the Nigerian authorities who say their military campaign against the militants is succeeding, he adds.
Hours before the military issued its statement, the governor of Borno state Kashim Shettima said the vast majority of the girls were still missing and offered a reward of 50m naira ($308,000; Â£184,000) for information.
The air force, army, police, local defence units and volunteers have all been involved in the search for the schoolgirls.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the ""shocking"" mass abduction and called for the girls' immediate release.
""The targeting of schools and schoolchildren is a grave violation of international humanitarian law,"" he said in a statement.
""Schools are, and must remain, safe places where children can learn and grow in peace.""
The BBC's Hausa Service says Boko Haram has kidnapped civilians in the past - usually women to work as sex slaves.
Gunmen reportedly arrived at the school in Chibok, a remote area of Borno state, late on Tuesday, and ordered its teenage residents on to lorries.
A local politician said about 50 soldiers had been stationed near the school ahead of annual exams, but were apparently overpowered.
Local residents reported hearing explosions followed by gunfire.
""Many girls were abducted by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the school in a convoy of vehicles,"" local education official Emmanuel Sam told the AFP news agency.
A girl who managed to escape and did not want to be named told the BBC that she and fellow students were sleeping when armed men burst into their hostel.
The girl said she and her schoolmates were taken away in a convoy, which had to slow down after some of the vehicles developed a fault, at which point 10 to 15 girls escaped.
""We ran into the bush and waited until daybreak before we went back home,"" she said.
Nigerian media reported that two members of the security forces had been killed, and residents said 170 houses were burnt down during the attack.
The militants know the terrain well and the military has had only limited success in previous efforts to dislodge them from their forest hide-outs.
Militants from Boko Haram - which means ""Western education is forbidden"" in the local Hausa language - frequently target educational institutions.
This year, the group's fighters have killed more than 1,500 civilians in three states in north-east Nigeria, which are currently under emergency rule.

But Craig Overton (2-35) struck, removing Jimmy Adams (47) and Rilee Rossouw in quick succession, before Jack Leach (2-54) and Tim Groenewald (2-27) hastened the decline.
Hampshire then put Somerset in to face six overs, but they closed on 18-0.
Overton, who was unused by England in last week's three-game T20 series with South Africa despite being called up to the squad, bowled a crucial spell to turn the tide.
With Liam Dawson (53) and Adams going well in their patient opening stand, the fast bowler found the latter's outside edge before Rossouw top-edged through to Steven Davies to go for a fifth duck in his last eight County Championship innings.
Dawson fell lbw soon after to Lewis Gregory (3-51) and, despite James Vince's 47, Hampshire's batting fell apart as Leach's accurate left-arm spin gave nothing away.
With a batting point secured, Hampshire captain George Bailey declared, but Marcus Trescothick (10 not out) and debutant Eddie Byrom, who was unbeaten on one, had no troubles reaching stumps under the floodlights.

58,"Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger.
Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet.
Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life.
Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world ""Earth 2.0"" and the ""closest so far"" to our home.
It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth.
Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: ""It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.""
The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth.
Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own.
Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's.
The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet.
The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.
Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star.
This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met.
Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet.
Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: ""I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date.
""What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.
""It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.""
While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth.
""If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,"" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.
""The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.""
""Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.""
Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: ""Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.
""However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make.
""So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.""
Dr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: ""Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii.
""In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?""
He added: ""When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.
""So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.""
The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.

Neilson has said a top-six finish would represent success for the Edinburgh club this season.
Doncaster believes the exciting drama of last season augurs well for the new campaign.
""After such an exciting end to last season: we had Aberdeen pushing Celtic close at the top and we had an incredible battle at the bottom of the Premiership with the top of the Championship in the play-offs; absolutely endorsing the decision the clubs made a couple of years ago to create them,"" he said.

""We welcome Hearts back this year and a lot of people will be looking to see how Robbie Neilson gets on.""
Doncaster also responded to reports that the SPFL has been inundated by complaints that all 10 in League Two clubs will be worse off as a result of corporate hospitality and advertising requirements in the ruling body's new £2m sponsorship agreement with Ladbrokes.
""I read that I was inundated with complaints which seemed a bit hyperbolic,"" he said.
""I had two clubs who emailed me with some queries on the deal. There is a concern about the distribution model and the way in which the sponsorship revenue is divvied up.
""But the reality is that if you look at broadcasting revenue, that gets divvied up amongst all 42 clubs and League Two clubs don't put anything into that deal.
""So, I think it's a fair distribution model and has delivered more money for clubs than under the old split league system - with the SFL operating independently of the SPL - I think the vast majority of clubs are delighted with the way the merger has panned out and the way the SPFL is operating.

The PM has pledged an in/out referendum by the end of 2017, while the Lib Dems are ""unambiguous"" in their EU support.
Meanwhile, some firms criticised the use of their quotes in a Labour advert.
Mr Miliband used the first official day of election campaigning to unveil his party's Better Plan for Business during a speech at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London.
'Over-stepped the mark'
To reinforce Labour's business message, the party also took out a full-page advertisement in the Financial Times, setting out its determination to ""put the interests of Britain and British business first rather than risk an EU exit"".
But a spokesman for Siemens said Labour had ""over-stepped the mark"" by quoting its chief executive, Juergen Maier, in the advert.
In it, Mr Maier says: ""The prospect of a referendum that may or may not happen, at a date yet to be decided upon, with a choice between two unknown options, is profoundly worrying for business leaders.""
While the quote is not disputed, a spokeswoman said the firm would be contacting Labour to express its displeasure.
""We did not give them permission [to use the quote]. We did not know about this. We are an apolitical organisation,"" she said.

Labour has quoted a number of pro-EU company leaders in the full page advert the party has taken out in the FT today.
""We would be devastated - as a company that loves London and wants to be in London - if Britain were out of Europe,"" is the view of Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of the mining giant, BHP Billiton.
My Labour sources were being very careful to explain last night that the business leaders quoted in the advert were not endorsing Labour.
They were simply being quoted to show the strength of feeling about Europe.
What is interesting is that Labour has chosen the first day of the election campaign to focus on an area - business - some see as a weakness for the party.

Kellogg's said ""eyebrows were raised internally"" when the company was told its head of UK and EU operations, Jonathan Myers, would be quoted. But a spokesman said it was too late to have the remarks removed by the time they were told about them on Sunday afternoon.
Asked about the quotes, Mr Miliband said: ""We've simply quoted public statements by these businesses about the place of Britain in the European Union.
""Lots of businesses all round this country aren't necessarily going to be supporting Labour or the Conservatives but they do have a very strong view about our place in the EU.""
'Start a revolution'
Meanwhile, Labour's economic claims were also called into question by one of its leading donors, Dr Assem Allam, who told the Daily Telegraph that its plans for a ""mansion tax"" and a rise in the top rate of tax were ""alienating"" wealth-creators.
Mr Miliband retorted that unlike the Conservatives, Labour ""donors will have particular views on things - we don't always do what our donors say"".
The Labour leader launched his party's manifesto on the eve of a party political broadcast by Hollywood actor and Sherlock star Martin Freeman who is set to endorse Labour's values of ""community, compassion and decency"".
The 22-page manifesto promises to cut and freeze business rates for more than 1.5 million small business properties, while at the same time creating an independent National Infrastructure Commission and a British Investment Bank that will support a network of regional banks to boost competition on the High Street.
Mr Miliband also promised ""to start a revolution in vocational education"" that will ensure all young people study English and maths to 18, with a guaranteed apprenticeship for those that work hard and get the grades.
Mr Balls insisted the manifesto would not include any pledges that required ""additional borrowing"" - but the Conservatives warned that a Labour government would raise taxes for every working family in Britain by £3,028.
'Banging on about Europe'
But it was the EU that Mr Miliband focused on - and what he sees as the consequences of an in/out EU referendum.
Pledging to return Britain to ""a leadership role"" in a reformed EU, he said: ""There could be nothing worse for our country or for our great exporting businesses than playing political games with our membership of the European Union - I'm not going to do it.""
Main pledges
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
He said David Cameron ""came to power promising to stop his party 'banging on about Europe'. Now if he has his way, he'll have us inside Europe banging on the door to leave or, even worse, outside Europe - banging on the door to be let back in.""
""It's simply the wrong direction for our country,"" he said.
""We'll show strong leadership to get the best for Britain. We won't condemn this country to years of uncertainty, years of insecurity, by threatening our European future.""
But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said his members thought it was ""sensible"" to hold an EU referendum based on reforms, and he warned Labour ""there's more to business than just Europe"".

Scottish full-back Stuart Hogg ran in the opening try but Leigh Halfpenny's three penalties and a slick Rhys Webb score put Wales 16-10 up by half-time.
A disallowed Liam Williams effort and a missed Halfpenny penalty gave Scotland hope that they could recover.
But Jon Welsh's late try was not enough after Jonathan Davies had powered over.
Wales are now back on track to mount a championship challenge, but despite the Scots' improvement, they still seem a little short of the Six Nations heavyweights.
Warren Gatland's side arrived in Edinburgh reeling from that loss to a patchwork England side.
Scotland also began the tournament with a defeat, to France in Paris, but there was enough in their display to give their fans hope they could beat Wales for the first time in the Gatland era.
The Scots had spoken of keeping the penalty count down, but they conceded three in the first five minutes, one of which was kicked by Halfpenny to give Wales the lead.
As the Welsh began to build pressure, they were hit by a breakaway try.
Alex Cuthbert lost possession and Richie Gray shipped the ball wide to Hogg, who showed great speed to race past the cover defence and score under the posts. Laidlaw's conversion and a subsequent penalty put the Scots 10-3 up before Halfpenny responded with a three-pointer of his own.
Scotland lost fly-half Finn Russell to the sin-bin on the half-hour when he was judged to have taken out opposite number Dan Biggar with a dangerous tackle in the air. Halfpenny brought the score to 10-9 with the resultant penalty.
Wales did not take long to make their one-man advantage count, a sweeping move from inside their own half stretching the Scots' defence to breaking point, and scrum-half Webb diving over in the corner.
Halfpenny added the extras to put Wales 16-10 up at the break.
Two Laidlaw penalties either side of a successful Halfpenny kick kept the Scots within three early in the second-half.
Wales had a Liam Williams try ruled out for an off-the-ball infringement by Alun Wyn Jones, but the referee could not save Scotland 15 minutes from the end when Davies scored Wales' second try.
The British and Irish Lion came on to a Biggar pass at pace and, after powering through some soft midfield tackling, the centre coasted under the posts to leave Halfpenny with the simplest of conversions to give Wales a 10-point lead.
That looked to have ended the match as a contest, but the Scots refused to buckle, with Mark Bennett and Hogg making searing line breaks.
They did force a try in the dying seconds when Welsh ploughed over from close range, but it was too late and once again the home side had to be content with the 'gallant losers' tag.

Golf is returning to the Olympics for the first time since 1904 at Rio next summer.
The sport's ruling bodies were criticised by two-time major winner Greg Norman for not taking the threat of doping seriously enough.
The International Golf Federation (IGF) will run the drug-testing programme for the Olympics, beginning 13 weeks before the Games. It will include blood testing (at the moment there are only urine tests in golf), out of competition testing and an introduction of the whereabouts rule.
All Olympic golfers - male and female - will have to inform anti-doping officials where they are going to be for one hour each day between 5am and 11pm so they can be tested.
Bach added: ""The athletes will have to accept the Olympic standards during the next year prior to the Games and, of course, during the Games the first five will be tested on top of the random-testing and the targeted-testing during the Olympic period.""

Cardiff face Fulham in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 8 December, but before that, on Monday 2 January, the Bluebirds entertain Whittingham's former club, Aston Villa in the Championship.
Back in 2007, then-Cardiff boss Dave Jones, bought Whittingham from Villa for a fee of £350,000.
Since then, the dead-ball specialist has established himself as one of the most popular players ever to pull on a Cardiff shirt.
He has been named in the Championship Team of the Season three times and, in 2015, he was included in the Football League Team of the Decade.
Whittingham also finished joint-top scorer in the Championship in the 2009-10 campaign having found the net 20 times in the league for the Bluebirds.
During his time with Cardiff, Whittingham has turned down the chance of a move away from the Welsh club.

""We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations,"" HRW's Fred Abrahams told BBC News.
Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties.
It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths.
Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.
In March, another human rights organisation,  
          Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases
 of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes.
It described Nato's failure to investigate these cases thoroughly as ""deeply disappointing"".
The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports.
In its report published on Monday, HRW said it had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes.
In one instance, it said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims.
What concerns Mr Abrahams, the main author of the report, is that the deaths remain unacknowledged and the families have been offered no compensation.
""Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial,"" he said.

""They refuse to give information about how they died and they refuse to investigate, and it is this lack of transparency that is deeply troubling.

81,"The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said the area used to farm the poppy plant, the source of opium, increased by 10% to 201,000 hectares.
But better farming conditions resulted in a higher yield per hectare, increasing overall production.
Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of the substance, which is the main ingredient in heroin.
Growing opium is a crime in the country, but it is still a major cash crop for impoverished farming communities.
The Taliban also taxes poppy production in areas it controls, which is a major source of income for its military activities.
UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said the figures were ""a worrying reversal in efforts"".
The opium produced from the poppy plant is used to make some of the most powerful medicinal painkillers, such as morphine.
However, many nations cultivate their own supply for medicinal use, and Afghanistan's production of illicit opium is primarily sued for the illegal drug trade.
The Afghan government has a stated policy of eradicating poppy crops, but the crop is widespread in many government-controlled regions, and officials are often accused of turning a blind eye.
Earlier this year, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt visited poppy farms in the north-east, where one farmer told him the local government knew about his crop, but ""they also know it is the only way anyone can make decent money.""
Just 355 hectares (877 acres) of poppies were eradicated by provincial authorities in the last year - down more than  90% since 2015, when almost 4,000 hectares were cleared.
Seven insurgents and one officer died during attacks on eradication teams this year. Seven more people were injured.
The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54% of the entire national opium production.
Helmand province, which has seen a resurgent Taliban presence, is the single largest producer, with more than 80,000 hectares of poppy cultivation.
The region was a contested area between the Taliban and Nato-led forces, before the latter withdrew in 2014.

Police said they left together and checked into a hotel, where she was found dead the next day, apparently strangled and with her head inside the hotel toilet.
Pemberton had previously testified in court that he had attacked Ms Laude after he realised she was transgender, but said she was still alive when he left the room.
The prosecution had argued Pemberton should be convicted of murder, but the court downgraded this to homicide.
Pemberton was also ordered to pay at least 4.5 million pesos ($95,350; Â£63,140) to Ms Laude's family.
Ms Laude's sister, Malou, told Reuters news agency: ""We expected a murder conviction but instead got homicide. We are not content with the decision.""
Pemberton will be temporarily detained in a Philippine jail until the Philippine and US governments agree on where he should be held during his prison term.
The case has led to calls from left-wing groups for the Philippines to end its military agreements with the US.

It is now hoped a further £300,000 can be raised by selling 3,000 shares for £100 each.
The charity behind the restoration said investors would have a say in the pier's future.
The 140-year-old structure was almost completely destroyed by fire in October 2010.
Simon Opie, CEO of the Hastings Pier Charity, said the shares were important to continue interest in the pier after its restoration.
He said: ""[The shares] are not just about the money, but it is about creating shareholder members, people who are invested in the pier, people who care about the town, the heritage of the pier, and people who will be here for the long term.
""The money that we have raised will restore the pier but beyond that it needs to have an economically viable future and that's what we hope we will create.""
The Panamanian company Ravenclaw, which owned the pier, was issued with a compulsory purchase order after it failed to carry out repair work.
The order was granted in 2012 and the council formally took ownership of the pier in August.
It is hoped the restoration will be completed by spring 2015.

87,"The proposals, which are subject to parliamentary approval, allow farmers to clear drainage ditches and streams without asking permission.
Farmers had complained that the Environment Agency was micro-managing flood control.
But academics told BBC News that diverting water off farmland could increase floods where people live.
The policy change was announced Environment Minister Liz Truss at the Oxford Farming Conference after what the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said were two successful pilot schemes.
She said: ""We will allow farmers across the country to maintain their own ditches up to 1.5km in length from April, so they can clear debris and manage the land.""
The decision was welcomed by the National Farmers' Union (NFU).
Its president, Meurig Raymond, said: ""The NFU has pressed Defra and the Environment Agency to enable farmers to undertake minor works for many years.""
But Professor Alan Jenkins from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology said he feared the policy could backfire.
""Waterlogged fields are no use to farmers,"" he said. ""They can't maintain their productivity on waterlogged soil so it makes sense for them to manage their fields accordingly.
""There is a potential downside however, in that if we increase drainage in fields during heavy rainfall it's possible there will be increased and faster transmission of water in the river system with a possible increase in flood risk downstream.""
Katherine Pygott from the consultancy firm Peter Brett agreed.
""If you are a landowner you may want to maximise productivity on a grouse moor by making it drier - but if you are trying to protect a town you want to keep water back on the uplands.
""It very much depends on local conditions - sometimes it would be unhelpful to speed drainage, sometimes it would not.
""There is a risk of making a free-for-all on drainage. It would be more sensible to make the existing system work.""

He had denied murder but was convicted at Newport Crown Court on Thursday and jailed for life.
He was also jailed for four years after admitting perverting the course of justice which will be served concurrently.
Mr Justice Wyn Williams said Jones had shown no remorse for his ""wicked and despicable"" actions.
He said: ""It may well be that you are never released from prison or if you are, you will be a very old man.""

91,"Kensington and Chelsea Council won an earlier case against Sophie Sotello in the magistrates' court after she refused to comply with the order.
When she appealed against the decision, the council dropped its case.
It said that it was now satisfied with evidence showing that her son, 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello, was receiving a suitable education.
Gabriel Sotello is one of more than 21,000 children on local council records as being home schooled.
According to the home education group Ed Yourself numbers have grown rapidly - by 17% between July 2013 and July 2014.
Many of these pupils, like Gabriel, have never been to school. Others have been taken out because their parents felt they were being bullied, neglected or were not reaching their potential.
Home schooled children do not have to follow the national curriculum or take part in public exams such as GCSEs or A-levels.
Mrs Sotello says her role is not to teach Gabriel, but to point him in the right direction.
""I wouldn't dream of saying I teach him,"" she says. ""I facilitate, I find the books, I research with them, I give them the power if you like.  It is child centred, finding out what makes them tick.""
Gabriel initiates much of his own learning and says he is inspired by the freedom to focus on what most interests him.
""Freedom is what makes learning still fun,"" he says. ""In home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker.""
Parents give various reasons for shunning school, and taking direct responsibility for educating their children.
Jackie Fahy, who organises a weekly meeting in a London park for like-minded parents, says some doubt the worth of the regimented school curriculum.
""A lot of children come out of school not prepared. The workplace is changing so rapidly that actually the school system is huge and vast and slow to change.  I'm not sure that children will be prepared for having several careers in a lifetime.""
Elizabeth Lil - who opted to educate her son and daughter herself - says that as a former teacher she felt that barely a tenth of her time in school was actually benefiting children.
""I was a science teacher, I did maths. I've so far used trigonometry once in my adult life. What you learn at school is not necessarily the skills you need for your adult life.""
These parents complain that councils are exceeding their powers by carrying out routine inspections of the quality of their children's education.
They insist that councils should intervene only if they have evidence that something is wrong.
But grey areas persist over exactly what councils can or should do.
Government guidance is clear that local authorities have no statutory duty to investigate the education children are receiving at home on a routine basis.
It says that parents are not legally obliged to cooperate with requests from councils for information.
The guidance tells councils not to confuse home education with truancy.
But it acknowledges that if councils are concerned then they might impose the sort of school attendance order sent to the Sotellos.

Verstappen was running a Renault engine upgrade which will not be available to Ricciardo until Saturday and which team boss Christian Horner said was expected to be worth in the region of 0.1secs a lap.

Murray, mother of tennis star Andy, and golfer Montgomerie announced plans for the facility, Scotland's first purpose-built golf and tennis centre, last summer.

However, some local residents raised concerns about the development being sited on green belt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.

Official statistics also showed that household consumption expenditure boosted the quarterly growth numbers.
But economist Shane Oliver told the BBC the numbers were ""well below potential"".
On an annual basis the economy expanded 2.3%, beating expectations for 2.1%.
Economic growth in the March quarter of 2014 was 2.9%.
""The March quarter GDP [gross domestic product] growth was far better than feared just a few days ago,"" said Mr Oliver, who is chief economist with AMP Capital in Sydney.
""However, Australia is still not out of the woods, as annual growth at 2.3% is well below potential, and a full 0.8% percentage points of the 0.9% growth came from higher inventories and trade.""
He said domestic demand remained ""very weak with consumer spending and home construction only just offsetting the ongoing slump in mining investment"".
""So the Australian economy has not crashed - as many had feared would happen after the end of the mining boom - but it is continuing to grow at a sub par pace,"" he added.
Australia's economy has been adjusting to a post mining-boom landscape. It saw its economy grow 0.5% in the October to December 2014 period from the quarter before, when growth was 0.4%.
On Tuesday, the country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), did not cut its lending rates further to help boost the economy, despite pressure from businesses to do so.
The decision saw Australian stocks fall 1.72% as investors saw little hope of a further cut in the near future.
However, Evan Lucas from IG Markets in Melbourne said ""the collapse of [Australian stocks] on the back of the RBA not having an explicit easing bias... was a bit of an overreaction"".
In May, the RBA cut its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to an all-time low of 2%.
Rising property prices in Australia's biggest city, Sydney, a strong currency and a drop in iron ore prices were among the reasons for the cut.
The May rate cut was the second this year, following a previous 25 basis point cut in February and followed similar action from central banks in China, Canada, Singapore, Korea and India.
A rising Australian dollar had also been cause for concern, particularly for Australia's big mining and energy exporters.

The 2014 winner Vos won the 119km stage from Nottingham to Stoke in a sprint finish.
Sunday's 113.2km final stage runs from Northampton to Kettering.
Vos, who lost the yellow jersey to Armitstead on Friday, won in what was a reduced sprint, with only 20 riders at the front of the race to battle it out after the bulk of the day's climbing was packed into the second half of the stage.
Boels Domans rider Armitstead had attacked along with Elisa Longo Borghini, Moolman-Pasio and Emma Johansson with a little under 20km remaining, catching and passing lone breakaway rider Emilia Fahlin.
Armitstead said: ""The race stayed together until the climb and then me, Ashleigh and Elisa went on the second Queen of the Mountains [intermediate sprint]. Emilia was in no-man's land so she came back up to us.
""There was a bit of co-operation for maybe five kilometres and then Emma and Elisa started attacking.""
But the chasing pack, including Vos, battled back and caught them shortly before the 1km-to-go Flamme Rouge to set up the sprint finish.
She added: ""In the final kilometres I could tell [the peloton] were coming back.
""Coming into the final kilometre there were a couple of turns with up-hill flickers and again Emma and Elisa were attacking, so it was just about covering them.
""As the group from behind pulled, I tried to put myself in a good position but got caught out a little bit on the last corner.""

101,"The Education Policy Institute think tank has produced a league table of academy trusts and councils in England.
David Laws, former schools minister and the institute's chairman, said successive governments had been ""in denial"" about failing academies.
The Local Government Association said it showed academies were no ""magic bullet"" for improving schools.
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Our ambition remains for all schools to become academies.""
Mr Laws said that when he served as education minister in the coalition government there had been internal data showing weaknesses in academy trusts, but there had been a reluctance to publish such information when ministers were promoting academy expansion.
But the Education Policy Institute has now published its own rankings showing how local authorities compare with multi-academy trusts with at least five schools.
The findings show that academy trusts are among the most and least successful at improving pupil performance, at both primary and secondary level.
In between is a spread of success and underachievement, with the analysis concluding that there is little overall difference between academy trusts and local authorities.
The average for academy trusts and local authorities is described as ""almost identical"".
Mr Laws says that it shows it would have been ""rash and dangerous"" to press ahead with forcing all schools to become academies, as it would have meant that some high-achieving local authorities could have been put into lower-achieving academy trusts.
The former education minister said that for successive governments there had been a ""lack of political will to show that some academies are not doing well"".
Mr Laws, a former Liberal Democrat MP, said that a ""lot of political capital has been invested"" in presenting academies as the way to raise school standards.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has had to abandon plans to force all schools to become academies, but Mr Laws says their political protection went back to the early days of the first academies created by Labour governments.
Mr Laws said that they were seen by the government as ""a small and precious flower that people wanted to stamp on"".
The comparisons produced by the think tank are based on how much pupils have improved, rather than exam results, as a way of measuring the effectiveness of local authorities and academy trusts.
Many academies operate as stand-alone schools, so these are not included in the rankings, which compare multi-academy trusts.
Mr Laws said that the findings highlighted the need to find ways to scrutinise and improve weak academy chains - but that did not mean that the principle of academies, with greater autonomy, was flawed.
But he suggested that it showed successful local authorities should be able to set up their own academy trusts, rather than have schools taken away from them.
Report author Jon Andrews also highlighted other factors, such as regional differences. Schools in London are higher performers - and he says that both local authorities and academy trusts are likely to do better if they have schools in the capital.
The Sutton Trust education charity has also published a report warning that too many academy trusts are not providing a good enough education for disadvantaged pupils.
It says that one in five academy chains is ""performing substantially below the national average for attainment and improvement"" for children from poorer families.
Lizzie Rowe, chief operating officer of the Education Fellowship, the lowest rated primary academy trust, said that trusts needed to be given time to make progress and that this was not always shown in immediate results.
""Data enables you to judge the pace and direction of a journey - data is not the journey. Some political powers forget this.
""Our strategy is very sound in developing leadership and enabling teachers to deliver outstanding lessons.
""Some of the most successful academies started well over a decade ago and were given millions of pounds to get established. We are a new trust working within an area of neglect and deprivation by all political bodies.""
She said: ""We receive no support from our regional schools commissioner, only negative challenge.""
Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said: ""Councils have long been highlighting the fact that school structures are not a magic bullet to improve education, and what really matters is outstanding teaching and strong leadership.
""Every school and every community is different, and head teachers need the freedom to choose, in partnership with parents and councils, the structure that is most appropriate for them.""
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""These reports highlight many impressive multi-academy trusts that are driving up standards and delivering an excellent education to thousands of children across the country.
""They are playing a vital and increasingly important role in the school system - thanks to their ability to share resources, expertise and provide support to schools that are struggling.
""Our ambition remains for all schools to become academies with more schools joining multi-academy trusts - our evidence shows this is the best way to bring about sustained improvement.""

102,"The 78-year-old ex-Scotland international says several of his old team-mates are affected.
He believes it is as the result of heading heavy footballs in the 1950s and '60s.
""People of our era, the balls we played with were big, heavy things,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.
""To lift them up to take a throw-in you'd have to do special training, and the conditions we played in - snow, rain and mud - and we trained with these things as well, every day, heading practice as well.
""Whether this problem of dementia hastens the end of your life or not I don't know, I'm not a medical person - but what I am saying is these were my pals, these were the guys I played with and they have got these problems.""
St John believes football as an industry should help ex-pros with care costs and said: ""If someone needs special care as a result of their career and their career was football, then football should pay for that.""
The Football Association said it was committed to supporting research into degenerative brain disease among former players.
St John's former Liverpool team-mate Geoff Strong, who won the FA Cup in 1965 alongside the Scot, died aged 75 from Alzheimer's in 2013 while last year it was revealed that three members of England's 1966 World Cup squad - Martin Peters, Nobby Stiles and Ray Wilson - have the condition.
Former West Brom striker Jeff Astle died in 2002, aged 59, from brain trauma caused by heading footballs throughout his career.
He was originally diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, but a re-examination of his brain found he had died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a progressive degeneration caused by repeated head trauma.
St John praised the work that Astle's family have done through the Jeff Astle Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of brain injury in all forms of sport.
But he still believes the Professional Footballers' Association and other football authorities can do more to help former players and the families who are caring for them.
""The game is awash with money, absolutely, so you can't turn round and say it's a finance thing,"" said St John, who played 336 times for Liverpool, scoring 95 goals.
Last year, the FA said it wanted world governing body Fifa to investigate whether former players have dementia as a consequence of playing the game and added that it took concerns about concussion and head injuries ""extremely seriously"".
""In 2015 we established an expert panel which led to the publication of the FA concussion guidelines,"" it said.
""The expert panel further agreed that research is particularly required into the issue of whether degenerative brain disease is more common in ex-footballers.
""The FA is determined to support this research and we have recently agreed with the PFA to jointly fund and support this research as we believe that a collaborative approach will strengthen the credibility and resource available.""",Former Liverpool striker Ian St John has called on football's leaders to look after former professionals who have dementia and Alzheimer's disease.,38911979,"Former Scottish international football player and Liverpool legend Ian St John has expressed concern about the high number of his former teammates who are developing dementia, believing that heading heavy footballs in the 1950s and '60s is the likely cause, and calling on the football industry to provide better support and care for affected players.",0,"Article: {}

Relations between Russia and the West have been tense since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014.
Russia's envoy also criticised Nato for a military exercise in the Baltic.
Wednesday's talks in Brussels ran more than 90 minutes over schedule.
""Many allies disagree when Russia tries to portray [the Ukraine conflict] as a civil war,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a new conference.
""This is Russia destabilising eastern Ukraine, providing support for the separatists, munitions, funding, equipment and also command and control.""
He added: ""Nato and Russia have profound and persistent differences. Today's meeting did not change that.""
Mr Stoltenberg said it was important to keep channels of communication open ""to discuss our differences and to reduce the risk of military incidents"".
He also said that the two sides had agreed on the importance of implementing the Minsk peace agreement, which has produced a fragile truce in eastern Ukraine.
Russia's envoy to Nato, Alexander Grushko, said a US guided-missile destroyer had sailed near the Russian port of Kaliningrad last week in an attempt ""to exercise military pressure on Russia"".
""We will take all necessary measures, precautions to compensate these attempts to use military force,"" he said.

104,"Sir Christopher Pitchford, the inquiry's chairman, said he recognised the public interest in proceedings being ""as open as possible"".
The senior judge said he would assess each anonymity request individually.
The Metropolitan Police has already asked for large parts of the investigation to be in private.
Campaigners who say they were wronged during operations dating back decades are calling for maximum disclosure.
They include women who did not realise their partners were undercover officers, and a long list of social justice campaigners who are trying to establish whether they were unfairly monitored.
The preliminary ruling means that there will be no blanket restrictions on material relating to undercover operations being disclosed if Sir Christopher rules the public interest lies in disclosing them.
Some 33 individuals, nine of them former undercover police officers, have already asked for anonymity.
Scotland Yard, backed by the government, has also argued it should not be forced to admit to the existence of some operations.
Undercover Inquiry: Why it matters - what's at stake?
Deceived women: Who has received an apology from the police?
In an 85-page ruling, Sir Christopher says that the inquiry will have to grapple with seemingly ""irreconcilable"" arguments over whether the public interest lies in keeping sensitive police information secret and protecting the true identities of former undercover officers - or in disclosing past events because of public concerns.
""The starting point is that no restriction order will be made, in the public interest of openness in the Inquiry and its proceedings, unless it is necessary in the countervailing public interest of the protection of individuals from harm and/or effective policing,"" says the ruling.
""It is not possible to state at the level of principle or generality where the public interest balance will rest.
""The Chairman will approach evaluation on a case-by-case basis according to the nature and quality of evidence received in support of the application.""
One woman who was deceived into an undercover relationship, known only as ""Lisa"", said she was not optimistic that the ruling would lead to the truth coming out - saying she feared the inquiry had failed to recognise there was a duty to reveal the truth to people who had been victims.
""I'm glad that they have not been allowed to have blanket anonymity,"" she told the BBC.
""But my biggest fear is that the police will be able to drag this out.
""They won't give up a single piece of information without applying for restriction orders.
""It took four-and-a-half years for me to get an apology in my case.""
The ruling stresses that police officers who want to remain anonymous will have to provide evidence of the possible harm they could be exposed to, if named in public.
This would have to include evidence about the nature or gravity of the risk an individual would face and complex arguments about whether naming someone would breach their human rights.
Similarly, forces will have to show how disclosure of operational details would cause damage to undercover policing.
The Metropolitan Police, backed by other police chiefs and government, had argued that it should be allowed simply to ""neither confirm nor deny"" details of operations.
Sir Christopher must now start assessing the 33 current applications for publicity restrictions and whether any of them need to be backed up by further evidence.
In June, Sir Christopher will also begin considering if the state must be forced to tell parents of dead children that their child's identity was used to create fake personas for undercover officers.",Undercover police officers facing claims of wrongdoing will not automatically get anonymity at a forthcoming major public inquiry.,36196745,"The Undercover Police Inquiry has ruled that there will be no blanket restrictions on material related to undercover operations being disclosed, and the chairman will assess each anonymity request individually, taking into account the possible harm the individual could face and the damage disclosure could do to undercover policing, while also considering the public interest in openness and transparency.",0,"Article: {}

106,"The Real Madrid forward got the decisive goal when he stooped low to head in Miguel Veloso's superb cross.
Up until then they were frustrated by a disciplined Sweden side, who went close through Johan Elmander, Sebastian Larsson and Kim Kallstrom.
No player has scored more headed goals (four) than Ronaldo in European World Cup 2014 qualification
The second leg will take place at Solna's Friends Arena on Tuesday.
That promises to be another fascinating contest between two sides, with the impetus now on Sweden to attack, having set their stall out to defend for long periods during the first leg.
They did, however, create the better chances in the opening 45 minutes despite Portugal enjoying 67% of the possession.
With Paris St-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic given special attention by Portugal's defence, his attack-minded team-mates found themselves with more space than they should have been afforded.
Norwich's on-loan forward Elmander was first to cause nerves in the home support when he stretched to send Mikael Lustig's right-wing cross inches past the post.
Erik Hamren's men then created two great chances in the space of two minutes. Sunderland's Larsson surged forward from midfield to strike a low shot that Rui Patricio dived to his left to divert, before Kallstrom, winning his 107th cap, smashed an 18-yard free-kick that brushed Portugal's upright.
Ibrahimovic failed to register a single touch in the opposite box against Portugal
The home side's best chance of the half came in the first five minutes when Ronaldo and Raul Meireles combined before feeding Joao Moutinho, who drifted round keeper Andreas Isaksson before firing into the side-netting.
Portugal's frustrations continued after the break as Sweden sat deeper, while their coach Paulo Bento probably would have been left exasperated by some of the awful attempted deliveries into the area.
But with eight minutes left one cross led to something greater when Dynamo Kiev's Veloso's fantastic delivery found Ronaldo, who threw himself at the ball to give Portugal the lead.
Moments later, the Real Madrid marksman almost scored his 30th of the season, but saw his header bounce back off the crossbar.
Sweden offered little as an attacking threat after the break, with Ibrahimovic failing to trouble Patricio and his defence. The skipper will have to show the sort of form he has produced for Paris St-Germain this season on Tuesday if Sweden are to stand a chance of going to Brazil.
""We would have been very happy with a draw,"" Sweden coach Erik Hamren said.
""We played a good game defensively - the goal was unnecessary, we were careless with that cross.""
Bento added: ""We created a great early chance and Sweden hit back. But in the second half it was one way for us.
""It was an important step to reach the World Cup but not yet decisive.""

Built by the Swansea Canal Navigation Company between 1794 and 1798, the canal runs 16.5 miles (26.5km) from Swansea to Hen Neuadd in Powys.
But since 1958, parts have been abandoned, sold off and filled in.
""It could take many, many years - decades - before we can see the first boats go down the full length of canal because there's so much work to be done,"" said Joe Coggins, from Glandwr Cymru, the canal and river trust in Wales.
""These are small building blocks and the work being carried out this week is part of the wider project.""
The canal was built primarily to carry coal down to Swansea Docks with the main cargos of coal, iron and steel making the enterprise profitable.
The canal was sold to the Great Western Railway in 1873 and it continued to make a profit until 1895.
A period of decline followed with commercial traffic ceasing in 1931 but horse-towed maintenance boats continued until 1958.
Parts of the canal were then abandoned, sold off and filled in.
Glandwr Cymru inherited a central section of the canal, approximately five miles between Clydach and Ynysmeudwy.
The five locks in it are not navigable with gates removed but weirs are used to ensure water supply to Mond Nickel works at Clydach.
The canal is now popular among towpath users and the Swansea Canal Society is doing the restoration.
Swansea Canal Society and the Waterway Recovery Group are doing the work along the canal, supported by Glandwr Cymru.

114,"Many MPs are spending a lot of time in their constituencies preparing to contest the most closely-fought and unpredictable election in decades.
As early as last year Labour taunted the government that this was a ""zombie"" Parliament, as much of the legislation in the coalition's programme from 2010 had already been passed.
The opposition has repeated the allegation many times since. MPs on the government side have hit back with claims that Labour has given up scrutinising bills properly.
But as MPs look to the final few weeks before the dissolution of the Parliament elected in 2010, there are still a few bills left to deal with.
A bill to improve and strengthen the service complaints system and enable payments to be made to charities and other organisations that support the Armed Forces across the UK.
The bill began in the the Lords and has passed all stages in the upper house. It is awaiting its Commons report stage at a date to be confirmed.
It is likely that the third reading will also be taken on the same day. As the bill is not particularly controversial it is likely to see royal assent before Parliament is dissolved.
A bill overhauling consumer rights law, covering contracts for goods, services, digital content and the law relating to unfair terms in consumer contracts.
Consideration of Commons amendments in the Lords was on 24 February, so this will make it to the statute book.
A bill to devolve powers to set the rate of corporation tax to the Northern Ireland Assembly.
It was due to have its remaining Commons stages - report stage and third reading - on 4 March.
The devolution of powers to set the corporation tax rate was a key demand of political leaders ahead of the Stormont House Agreement finalised in Belfast last month.
It is still to go through the Lords but the government aims to pass the law before May's general election and Labour has not opposed it.
The bill makes a number of changes which would affect business generally and in particular areas including decriminalising non-payment of the BBC licence fee.
All Commons stages are complete, while its third reading in the Lords is due on 4 March.
However, peers defeated the government during report stage, voting for there to be no move to decriminalise non-payment of the fee before 2017.
It remains to be seen if MPs will overturn this amendment and another game of ping pong will ensue.
First reading - the bill's formal introduction, in which the name of the bill is read out but no debate takes place.
Second reading - a debate on the general principles of a bill.
Committee stage - detailed scrutiny of the bill, either in a committee of the whole House or in a public bill committee.
Report stage - consideration of the report of the bill committee and a further chance for MPs or peers to table amendments.
Third reading - final consideration of the amended bill as a whole. In the House of Lords, there is a final chance to table amendments.
Ping pong - if one House rejects the other's amendments, the bill goes back and forth between the lower and upper Houses until agreement is reached.
A bill concerning the membership and functions of the House of Commons Commission, which is responsible for the administration and services of the House of Commons.
This bill was fast-tracked through the Commons, with all stages on one day - 24 February.
After that, it will need the approval of peers.
This is a private members' bill, which would put into legislation a target of spending at least 0.7% of national income on aid.
It has passed its Commons stages and had its report stage in the Lords on 27 February.
Unlike most private members' bills, Liberal Democrat MP Michael Moore's bill stands a good chance of becoming law.
The bill to allow women Church of England bishops to sit in the House of Lords had its committee stage in the upper House on 26 February.
It sailed through its Commons stages and its second reading in the Lords. Basically, its passage is guaranteed.
The first woman bishop has already been consecrated. The Right Reverend Libby Lane became Bishop of Stockport in January.
The bill to give people greater flexibility in accessing their pension benefits and to help them make informed decisions about what to do with benefits is at the ping pong stage.
MPs considered Lords amendments on 24 February.
The bill provides for a recall petition to be triggered if an MP is sentenced to a prison term or is suspended from the House for at least 21 sitting days.
It is due to have its third reading in the Lords on 2 March, having passed all stages in the Commons.
This bill started in the Lords and had its Commons report stage and third reading on 23 February, with the Lords due to consider any amendments made by MPs in March.
This bill aims to improve access to finance for businesses and individuals and also concerns public procurement and the regulatory provisions relating to business and certain voluntary and community bodies.
It has passed all stages in the Commons and has its Lords report stage on 3 March.
This private bill, which applies to Transport for London and its subsidiaries, started in the House of Lords and had its Commons report stage on 26 February.
Private bills are usually promoted by organisations, like local authorities or private companies, rather than the government.
They are distinct from private members' bills which are promoted by individual MPs or peers.
And spare a thought for those that are likely to fall by the wayside.
A bill which would confer powers to acquire land and to construct and operate phase one of HS2 - a high speed rail line from London to Birmingham.
This is a hybrid bill, which features aspects of a public bill and a private bill. This means it is of general application but it contains provisions which have a different legal effect on the private interests of particular persons.
The hybrid bill procedure gives those persons who are directly and specially affected an opportunity to petition against the bill and be heard in select committee.
Following the bill's second reading it was sent to a select committee and has remained there ever since.
The government has admitted that the legislation will not be passed before the general election.
This is private members' bill sponsored by Conservative peer Lord Saatchi.
It has passed all stages in the Lords and had its Commons second reading scheduled for 27 February, although it was too low down the day's schedule for MPs to even begin debating it.
Even if the bill manages a second reading, it might struggle to progress further in the time left before Parliament dissolves.
It has also faced some passionate opposition from other MPs and peers.
Conservative MP Jonathan Evans' private members' bill has already completed its journey through the House of Lords and has its Commons report stage on 6 March.

115,"Concern is mounting about the potential of a vicious power struggle in Addis Ababa, triggering a negative chain reaction across the region.
For many of Ethiopia's Horn allies, the death has come at an awkward moment, not least because a delicate political transition in Somalia is incomplete and under serious strain, and a stand-off between South Sudan and Sudan risks dragging the region into a new armed conflagration.
Mr Meles was a complex figure, hard to pigeon-hole, much less force into a one-dimensional portrait frame.
A mystique has over the years grown around his personality and politics, making the task to objectively assess his legacy difficult and highly fraught.
To use a Churchillian phrase, the man was a riddle and a mystery inside an enigma, and by extension so too the secretive state he presided over.
But he was the one African leader who was impossible to ignore.
The diminutive ex-guerilla leader was a towering figure whose austere, unsmiling and understated public persona often belied his great influence and charisma.
Since 1991 he has been the undisputed and pre-eminent key player in the Horn - a formidable strategist whose role remained indispensable in the regional efforts to resolve deadly conflicts and contain militant Islamism.
Domestically, his legacy is contested. To his ardent fans, he was a true revolutionary impelled by a great sense of mission to overturn the residual feudal and Stalinist structures of the ancient regime.
He was the outsider whose genius led to the overthrow of an entrenched and deeply loathed dictatorship.
His message of social justice and modernisation resonated with many in the homeland, especially the marginalised ""lowlanders"" in Oromia and Ogadenia.
His concept of revolutionary democracy and ethnic federalism promised to create a fairer and inclusive order.
Measured against these lofty and progressive ideals, his record has, at best, been patchy and rather uninspiring.
The much-vaunted ambitious economic modernisation and liberalisation programme has created a new middle class, attracted huge foreign investment, spawned massive infrastructure projects, spurred economic growth and generally transformed the skylines of the major cities such as Addis Ababa and Mekele.
But it has not tackled the deep structural and systemic problems and inefficiencies that have hampered real growth. The Stalinist land tenure system and the complex bureaucratic system are still intact, and the vast majority remain trapped in poverty.
The democratisation and political reform process, which Mr Meles himself termed ""work in progress"", has long stalled.
Since the disputed May 2005 polls, the regime has increasingly become intolerant and autocratic, using a raft of new legislation to stifle and criminalise dissent and lock up opponents.
Why West will miss Meles
Obituary: Meles Zenawi
Life in pictures: Ethiopia's Meles Zenawi
A plethora of old and new armed ethnic factions continue to wage low-level insurgencies in the periphery. The new policy of engagement and piecemeal peace pacts with a select few has so far only succeeded in managing the problem and buying the regime more time.
Feeling vulnerable and insecure, Mr Meles has in the last few years become a leader whose overriding domestic political manoeuvres and calculations are driven by one instinct: regime survival.
He orchestrated a discreet purge of the ruling Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) and the administration, demoting, sidelining or reassigning key potential rivals and opponents.
His death has certainly created a leadership vacuum at the top and with no clear figure groomed to succeed him, the battle for succession could prove destabilising.
That said, the prospect of a large-scale upheaval, as some fear, is highly unlikely, partly because the country has a powerful, highly disciplined and cohesive army and security apparatus.
The opposition can, in theory, capitalise on the disarray within the ruling party to advance its goals and press for an early poll, but that looks difficult given the narrow factionalism and disorganisation within its ranks, not to mention the fact most of the influential opposition figures are either in exile or locked up.
Mr Meles has continued to enjoy good press in the region and across much of Africa, even as his stature diminished domestically.
He is hugely admired and many seem prepared to overlook his personal frailties and forgive his leadership shortcomings for one simple reason: no other African leader has in recent times deployed such great intellectual energy and firepower and used his diplomatic talent and influence to articulate the continent's key priorities and demands at global forums.
He did put Africa on the map, and as a skilled and effective negotiator and spokesman he certainly forced leaders in the developed world to listen. But whether this feat alone qualifies him to join the pantheon of the continent's great visionaries, like Kwame Nkrumah and Nelson Mandela, remains debatable.
Not in contention though is the fact that the late prime minister - almost single-handedly - transformed Ethiopia from a deeply conflicted and war-wracked peripheral Horn of Africa state into a supremely self-assured African diplomatic and military powerhouse.
From the mid-1990s and up until 2005, Ethiopia was a key stop for high-level Western dignitaries visiting the continent, and Mr Meles the must-see African leader whose advice and counsel was sought.
Many embraced him as a reformer and an elite member of the so-called ""new breed"" of African leaders.
The Ethiopian leader cultivated the new friendship and used it to forge strategic partnerships to raise his country's profile and advance its geopolitical and strategic national interests.
He swiftly rebuilt and modernised the army, initially in a bid to achieve parity with Sudan and negotiate a detente from a position of strength, but subsequently to ""tame"" a belligerent Eritrea, with whom relations had began to dramatically deteriorate a few years after its independence in 1991.
The two countries have since fought two bloody and costly border wars beginning from 1998. A peace pact and a border arbitration treaty brokered by international mediators failed to end to conflict permanently, partly because Addis Ababa refused to fully abide by the terms of the accords and to return the tiny barren piece of land awarded to Eritrea.
Hostilities have continued to simmer ever since, and periodic flare-ups are common along the volatile border.
It is plausible the death of Mr Meles may - far from creating opportunities for dialogue - spur Eritrea into escalating the tension.
That would be a disastrous and risky gamble which Eritrea must be dissuaded from taking. It is unlikely this is a course of action that would help it secure its perceived legitimate rights, much less win it friends in the region and beyond.
In Somalia, Ethiopia's military presence in the past year has been instrumental in putting the pressure on the militant group al-Shabab. Thousands of Ethiopian troops now control a number of key strategic areas in south-central Somalia.
The death of Mr Meles has raised new anxieties among the regional allies with troops in Somalia.
There are growing fears a destabilising succession battle and power struggle in Addis could potentially complicate matters and jeopardise the whole mission. Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga said as much in a recent radio interview.
Such fears are understandable, considering Ethiopia's history and political fragility.
However, there is hope too the country has achieved a level of maturity and that it has the institutional mechanisms and the structural resilience to weather the current storm and ensure a smooth transition that allows for policy continuity in Somalia.",The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has thrown the populous Horn of Africa giant into a period of deep uncertainty and created a serious leadership vacuum in the region with profound geopolitical implications.,19341954,"The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has raised concerns about a potential power struggle in Addis Ababa and its potential negative impact on the region, as well as his complex legacy both domestically and internationally, with some viewing him as a skilled diplomat and leader who transformed Ethiopia into a regional powerhouse, while others see him as a dictator who ignored his country's deep structural problems and stifled dissent.",0,"Article: {}

118,"Next was found to have used a tax avoidance scheme called a rate-booster.
The court ruled Next diverted UK profits to foreign subsidiaries to claim tax relief on overseas profits.
Such schemes are a way in which firms avoid corporation tax on foreign profits that are then paid back to the UK parent firm.
Under rules designed to prevent double taxation of company profits, firms were able to claim credit for tax paid on money they made overseas.
But some companies were able to exploit the rules through the creation of artificial arrangements involving what HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) referred to as ""complex circular movements of money between companies in the same group, so they can claim there has been double taxation"".
Known as rate-booster schemes, this enabled companies to avoid corporation tax by diverting profits made in the UK to foreign subsidiaries.
The foreign subsidiary then paid tax on those profits - often at a lower rate of corporation tax - before the profits were paid back to the UK parent company.
Finally, the UK parent company received credits from HMRC for the tax already paid by its subsidiary.
As a result, companies were able to claim far more tax had been paid on their overseas profits than was actually the case.
Legal changes in 2005 and 2009 mean rate-booster schemes are no longer possible or attractive, HMRC added.
The Next case is the second to reach court, following a 2013 ruling against P&O Ferries, although the firm appealed against the decision and an appeal judgement is outstanding.
HMRC said about £130m in tax was at stake across 20 rate-booster cases, which were awaiting the P&O and Next decisions.
About 70 rate-boosters have already been conceded by companies that wanted to avoid going to court. This has brought in more than £500m in tax, it added.
HMRC's director general of business tax, Jim Harra, said: ""This case shows how HMRC takes effective action against big businesses that try to avoid paying tax through convoluted, artificial avoidance schemes. HMRC expects all businesses to steer well clear of such schemes.""
In a statement, Next said it had paid the tax owed to HMRC ""some years ago"" and that this had been fully accounted for at the time.

Three Australian states - Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria - already require children to be immunised, or be on an approved catch-up programme, to enrol in childcare centres.
Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon said children were more susceptible to infections.
""If you, as a parent, expect the community to support you by either welfare payments or access to care, then you need to do your bit to contribute to that community by protecting other children,"" he told Fairfax Media.
The so-called ""anti-vax"" movement believes vaccinations may cause medical conditions such as autism, but overwhelming scientific research suggests this is not the case.
Vaccines can cause adverse reactions in a small number of people, like many medicines, but the accepted science is that the benefits far outweigh the risks.
Widespread vaccination also reduces the risk of infection to those who, for medical reasons, may not be able to receive the vaccine themselves.
So-called ""herd immunity"" is an important part of public health programmes. It stops the spread of disease by preventing an infection from moving among most people - the ones who have been vaccinated. And so it protects those few without the vaccine.
But as the numbers of those without protection rises, so to does the risk to each of them - something which happened alongside the first death from measles in the United States in 12 years.",Unvaccinated children would be banned from childcare centres and preschools under an Australian government plan.,39251585,"Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull is pushing for nationwide ""no jab, no play"" legislation to require parents to vaccinate their children before they can enroll in childcare, with some Australian states already implementing such laws, as health groups argue that parents have an obligation to protect children and prevent the spread of infectious diseases, while the ""anti-vax"" movement has been dismissed by medical professionals as unscientific and potentially dangerous.",0,"Article: {}

The debate was held in Westminster Hall, London.
The BBC said Mr Spencer's figures did not take into account its increasing investment in the region.
Mr Spencer said every other region, apart from the Midlands, had seen increased investment by the BBC.
Julian Knight, the Conservative MP for Solihull and a former BBC employee, said it had become a ""bi-polar organisation"" with its centres in London and Salford.

125,"A day after breaking the all-time record for pole positions, Hamilton was in total control at Monza, leading team-mate Valtteri Bottas to a one-two.
Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third and is three points behind Hamilton.
It is a crucial milestone for Hamilton as F1 next heads to Singapore, where Ferrari are expected to dominate.
The victory was Hamilton's sixth of the season - Vettel has only four - and it capped a perfect weekend for him.
He scored a brilliant pole in treacherous wet conditions on Saturday - more than a second clear of the next fastest driver - to take his tally to 69, one more than Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher.
Hamilton's victory was among the most straightforward of the season. He fought off a brief challenge from Williams driver Lance Stroll, a remarkable second on the grid, on the run down to the first corner and disappeared into a race of his own.
""The team did an amazing job. Valtteri did a great job. Mercedes power is better than Ferrari power so that's one thing,"" Hamilton said, as he was booed by the Tifosi during the podium interviews.
The fight was all behind him, as Bottas and the Ferrari drivers set about fighting up from their unusually low grid positions.
The Finn, who started sixth, was up to fourth on the first lap behind Hamilton, Force India's Esteban Ocon, another star of qualifying, and Stroll, who dropped a place in a tussle at the first corner.
Bottas got Stroll into Turn One on lap three, Ocon in the same place a lap later, to give Mercedes total control of the race, which they never surrendered.
Vettel limited the damage to his title hopes as much as was possible in the circumstances, passing team-mate Kimi Raikkonen around the outside into the first Lesmo on lap three, Stroll a couple of laps later before picking off Ocon into Turn One on lap eight.
The German, though, was no match for the Mercedes at Ferrari's home race - generally dropping at least half a second a lap - and his focus in the second part of the race became holding off Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.
The Australian, who qualified third but started 16th after being given a grid penalty for using too many engine parts this season, put in a brilliant recovery from his lowly grid position.
He picked his way through the slower cars in the first part of the race, pulling off a series of his trademark aggressive overtaking moves, and ran a long first stint to give himself fresher tyres for the final stint than the Ferraris ahead of him.
Ricciardo dived brilliantly inside Raikkonen from a long way back at the first chicane with 12 laps to go and began to set off after Vettel, who was just over 11 seconds ahead.
Initially, he began to close at a second a lap, but as the edge went from his tyres, his advantage reduced and Vettel crossed the line four seconds ahead.
Vettel later told his team over the radio that he had gone off track at one point and felt ""something was wrong"" afterwards, explaining part of his lack of pace.
""My start was not so good - I had quite a lot of wheel spin and we didn't quite have the pace of the leading two cars but seeing the people and having that support was amazing,"" Vettel said afterwards.
""We have a very strong car and will have a very strong end of the season.""
Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen got up from 13th on the grid - also victim of a penalty after qualifying second in the wet - to be eighth on the first lap.
But he wrecked his race by tangling with Williams driver Felipe Massa on the second lap, damaging his front wing and getting a puncture and rejoined last.
Verstappen recovered to 10th place, incurring the anger of Haas' Kevin Magnussen, from whom he stole the final point, when he moved over on him while overtaking the Dane at the second chicane and forced him on to the grass.
Stroll and Ocon inevitably slipped back behind faster cars from their superb starting positions, earned with starring drives in the wet.
But both drove solid and strong races to finish sixth and seventh, the Canadian fending off team-mate Felipe Massa for seventh place on the last lap, as the pair also fended off the second Force India of Sergio Perez.",Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton took the outright championship lead for the first time this season with a dominant victory in the Italian Grand Prix.,41141109,"Lewis Hamilton dominated the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, leading a Mercedes one-two finish ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas, as Sebastian Vettel finished third despite struggling with pace and facing pressure from Daniel Ricciardo in the final laps.",0,"Article: {}

In his BBC interview on Monday, the prime minister said that, if re-elected this May, he would serve the full five years of another Parliament and then leave Number 10 - leading Labour to accuse him of arrogance.
Mr Duncan Smith told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show the ""way that all comes about will have to be discussed"" adding that Mr Cameron would ""serve what essentially is a full term"" - but there would ""of course"" be a leadership contest at some point.
""You've had to literally rap the knuckles of people like Gordon Brown and previous prime ministers to get them to think of going,"" he said.

128,"The chain says it will commit to paying 28p per litre for 100% of its liquid milk throughout its entire range.
It is less than the 30-32p farmers estimate it costs to produce each litre but the farming union welcomed it.
Asda's announcement comes after protests by dairy farmers at branches of Asda, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi over the price they are paid for their milk.
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it was pleased Asda had recognised the ""plight of the dairy industry"" in its ""hour of need"".
The industry says a reduction in global demand for milk has led to an over-supply in the UK, creating difficult conditions for many dairy farmers.
Asda said it would increase the price it paid per litre to its milk supplier Arla from Monday, with the intention that it be passed directly on to farmers.
""Asda's origins are in dairy farming which is why we are acting in the best interests of our farmers and our customers by increasing the price we pay, introducing the Farmer's Marque label and not passing on any of the costs to customers - our retail price stays the same,"" he said.
It is not yet clear whether Arla, Britain's biggest milk co-operative, will pass on the increase in price to farmers.
Meurig Raymond, NFU president, urged Arla to ensure it passed the extra payment on ""with immediate effect"".
Asda previously announced a price cut of 0.8p per litre - taking the standard litre price to 23.01p for its UK members.
On Tuesday, Morrisons said it was launching a new milk brand which will see 10p per litre extra paid to farmers.
The Milk for Farmers brand, to be launched in October, means a four pint bottle (2.27 litres), which now sells for 89p, will cost an extra 23p.
The four main farming unions - the NFU, the NFU Cymru, NFU Scotland and the Ulster Farmers Union - held an emergency summit on Monday to develop an action plan to tackle falling milk, lamb and arable prices.
There have been days of protests by farmers including milk trolley challenges, blockades at distribution centres and even bringing cattle into supermarkets.
The average price paid to dairy farmers for milk across the UK is 23.66p - following a drop of 25% in a year.
The NFU said that currently Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Sainsbury's and the Co-op have arrangements where a farmer is paid a price above the cost of production for milk. Asda, Lidl and Aldi currently do not offer such deals to farmers.

129,"Having arrived at Adams Park with Super League honours and international recognition behind him, injury and personal issues brought a premature end to Smith's big move to the Premiership.
However, after returning to Leeds and then Wakefield in Super League, he accepted a second crack at union with Newcastle Falcons earlier this season.
Why would a player with a vast collection of honours in league go through the rigours of switching codes for a second time when so many others have struggled to adapt? Smith is clear.
Sam Burgess's move to Bath from Australian NRL side South Sydney in 2015 is much anticipated, with his ball-carrying, defensive work and offloading skills all appealing to the 15-man game.
There remains some doubt about where Burgess will be employed, as he can play anywhere across the back-row in league, but like Andy Farrell - another code-switcher - he could find himself in the centres.
However, Smith is concerned that trying to mould Burgess could take away some of his natural talent.
""I went on a show with Brian Moore when I made my debut against Leicester and I said anyone can be a success (in union) if they get the right coaching, and play to their strengths,"" Smith said.
""Don't try to change a player into something they're not. They need to use a player's strengths and work with it.""
""If I got into my 40s and 50s looking back on my career without having a proper go at it I'd have been disappointed with myself,"" he told BBC Sport.
""Obviously I had a go with Wasps and it didn't work out, but I'm very fortunate that Newcastle came in and wanted to sign me.""
Rugby league has been a useful talent pool for union clubs since the advent of professionalism in the late 1990s reversed a trend of players moving the other way for financial and sporting rewards.
Whereas once it was union stars such as Jonathan Davies, Scott Quinnell, Kel Coslett, Billy Boston and Tom van Vollenhoven who moved into the 13-man game, now it is Sam Burgess, Kyle Eastmond and Joel Tomkins  who have brought their skills into union.
Not everyone can make the same impact in both codes, as countless stars including Henry Paul, Lesley Vainikolo and Shontayne Hape can testify.
""I had a great time in rugby league, but there's only a certain type of player that can move codes,"" said Smith.
""They're two totally different games. All the rucking and mauling compared to the play-the-ball is completely different.
""Moves are similar, but it's different game plans. The fitness has to be different. You need to be intense for one or two minutes in union and then you get a break, while league is a bit more continuous. That's something else I'm going to have to work on during the off season.""
While Smith's rugby league career brought him Super League Grand Final winners' medals, and a Harry Sunderland Trophy for man of the match in the 2008 final, the move to Newcastle has seen him experience the opposite end of the scale.
Falcons feared potential relegation from the top flight until the penultimate game of the current campaign and have a big summer ahead to ensure improvement is made next season.
""I think the culture has to be player-driven, the coaches can only give you so much,"" Smith said.
""I've been about a long time and seen a lot of things,"" Smith said.
""But I still class myself as young, and the more you hang about with the younger lads it keeps you young.
""Keith Senior used to be like that, he'd hang around with all the young lads and still thought he was 19 like us lot.
""It keeps you young but I've got experience. I've got little things I learned in rugby league that I can bring through to Newcastle and I'm trying to do that in little ways.
""During the off-season I will probably have more to time to spend with the coaches and bring my knowledge of that game to mix in with the rugby union stuff.""
""Going back, Leeds had lots of very good professionals. I got brought up by people like Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock, Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow - they were very good pros and it filtered down into the academy.
""That's how you were brought up, if you stepped out of line then you got knocked back into line. That's somewhere where maybe at the Falcons we can tighten up a bit in the off-season.
""We need to set our standards ourselves, so when we get beat we can ask ourselves questions why and take a bit of responsibility off the coaches.""
With nearly 200 games for club and country across the two codes on his curriculum vitae, Smith has grown from young gun to seasoned pro.
The aim now for the Morley-born three-quarter is to establish a regular place at Kingston Park, once the Falcons have completed their 2013-14 campaign with the visit of Exeter.
""It's a bit frustrating going in and out, but you've got to look at the bigger picture,"" Smith continued.
""I'm getting my first summer holiday for something like 13, 14 years which will be brilliant. I'll go away and spend some time with the family and then we're back in mid-June.
""I've got two and a half months then before the Premiership season starts, where that is my real learning curve.

131,"The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead.
Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South.
""Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them.

""You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.""
The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.
The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000.
That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.
But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.
The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.
They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.
By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.

6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June
10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference
And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.
When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.
They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street.
But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.
Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.
The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.

He said he found plenty of bugs that could be exploited by hackers.
But he said most ISPs had been in contact with him and had worked to tighten security once told of the issues.
The audit of TalkTalk, Sky, BT, Plusnet, EE and Virgin Media was kicked off in the wake of the TalkTalk hack, which saw the personal details of 157,000 of its customers exposed.
More than 15,600 bank account number and sort codes were stolen.
Similar problems to those encountered by TalkTalk could have been experienced by any of the major ISPs, Mr Moore believes.

135,"Town were rewarded for their greater control and threat when the outstanding Mooy smashed a 25-yard shot into the top corner after the break.
Leeds, who slip to third from bottom with just one win from their first six league fixtures, rarely threatened.
Town held on to go four points clear thanks to a fifth win from six.
On-loan Manchester City midfielder Mooy was not certain to play after a hectic international break which saw him appear in both of Australia's World Cup qualifiers.
But he dictated the play as the Terriers had the better of a dull first half in which neither side could muster a shot on target.
Mooy, who was booked late in the first period for a nasty-looking lunge that infuriated Leeds manager Garry Monk and his coaching staff, came closest with a decent low strike.
But his second attempt on goal 10 minutes after the restart proved much more successful and was reward for the visitors' urgency and superior quality.
Chris Wood sent a header wide for Leeds before the break and could have snatched a barely deserved point late on, but failed to properly connect with another headed opportunity.
Leeds head coach Gary Monk:
""I'm disappointed with the result, of course. We went out there with the intention of trying to grab the initiative but partly due to the way (Huddersfield) set up it became a bit of a nothing game.
""We have to get a real reaction now on Tuesday. We need to take the three points, it's as simple as that.
""It's very important that we get this Elland Road monkey off our backs and get the three points.""
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
""There is every reason to be surprised. I don't know which team in this division can say they will start with 16 points after six games.
""We have deserved every one of the 16 points and we said at the start of the season we would play every single game and give ourselves no limits and at the moment we have great togetherness and a very good working attitude, especially in the defence.
""I think it isn't comfortable for the opponents against us at the moment.""

Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi have been informed about his disappearance.
Friend and fellow botanist Ian Sinclair, who has been liaising with the search parties, said they had been hampered by horrendous weather.
""The snow is continuing to melt, but there is a massive amount of snow damage to the forest such as collapsed trees,"" he said.
""The weather has been horrendous, with snow down to Sapa. This is extremely unusual as Sapa is upper tropical rainforest.

Economy Minister Simon Hamilton had previously said the rescue package was crucial to attracted US-inward investment for Northern Ireland.
A United Airlines statement said: 'We have regretfully taken this decision because of the route's poor financial performance.""
The ruling by the European Commission to block the funding package to protect Northern Ireland's one and only scheduled trans-Atlantic service defies logic and is an example of ""abysmal Brussels decision-making"".
Managing Director Graham Keddie said:  ""You could hardly get a worse example of process-driven madness.
""This is a vital link for business and losing it will be a body blow to executive ministers who use it to promote Northern Ireland to would-be investors from the United States.

""The executive did the right thing with its bid to save this key route. There was a risk to the flight and we stepped in to save it. Faced with the same circumstances again, I would make the same decisions. All public money has been recouped with interest and we retained the route for a longer period.
""Our decision to support the route was praised by many and, had we not have made an effort to save the United flight, we would have been rightly criticised.
""We were always aware of the potential of an issue around state aid compliance, but given the tight timescale to put a package of support in place, approval by the European Commission could not be sought in advance of agreeing a deal with United.""
""This is an international embarrassment.
""This is a huge blow to our international standing and the minister must tell us what he intends to do to sort it out.""
""Awarding a £9m subsidy for a global corporation, which makes billions every year, against the advice of senior civil service officials and against state aid rules, was a dangerous commitment of resources at a time of already stretched budgets.
""The gamble taken by the executive has spectacularly crash landed and there are now very serious questions for the economy minister to answer.
""We need to know what communication the minister had with the European Commission before and after he issued a ministerial direction, ignoring the advice of senior civil servants.
""Additionally, Simon Hamilton must outline how much public money has been spent advertising the route since the direction was issued.""
Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said the decision by United Airlines to halt its Belfast to Newark route is a serious blow to Northern Ireland, in economic and social terms.
He said: ""To lose our only direct air route from Northern Ireland to the United States will have a serious impact on our business community as well as local people using it to visit family or for holidays. Coming just weeks after United was offered £9 million to keep the route open after they threatened to pull it is a slap in the face to our Executive.
""We now learn that the funding was blocked by the EU Commission and I am calling on the Executive to explain what discussions were held with the Commission before the announcement, which was made with great fanfare. Is this another case of the Executive seeking good news headlines without adequate preparation? Did they even bother to check if this funding could break EU rules? It looks like the Executive and the Department for the Economy have let us down again.
""I have consistently challenged the Minister for Economy to reveal the evidence that he used in deciding to allocate this money to United Airlines in the first place. Every time he has been unable to give a satisfactory answer.
""Now that he has also been knocked back by the European Union, it is evident that he didn't even bother to check whether he was allowed to do it, let alone complete an economic appraisal for it.
""Maybe, in future, the minister will consider the need for proper due process to ensure that money is being spent on things that it can actually be spent on, and that will actually have a benefit to society as a whole.""
""I was against this subsidy being given to United in the first place.
""There are better uses for the £9m, especially when we are always being told that money's too tight to mention for a lot of departments.

148,"Many in the list have been found down old mine tunnels or on slag heaps where water and even fire have had the opportunity to work up novel compounds.
It is another example, the researchers argue, of our pervasive influence on the planet.
New minerals and mineral-like compounds are now being formed faster than at anytime in Earth's history, they say.
""These 200 minerals are roughly 4% of the total known minerals, but they all occurred in the last couple of thousand years, most in the last couple of hundred years,"" explained Robert Hazen from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC.
""That's an incredible rapid spike in the rise of mineral species unmatched in the history of our planet,"" he told BBC News.
The only period that bears comparison is the time when oxygen became abundant over the surface of the Earth just over two billion years ago. But that event would have played out over millions of years.
Minerals are specific combinations of chemical elements arranged into crystalline structures. Earth's rocks are built from different aggregations.
The likes of feldspar, quartz and mica will be known by most people. But bobcookite, calclacite, or elyite are obscure, to say the least.
Their existence is down to humans creating a setting where chemical reactions can take place between materials that might otherwise not have come into contact.
In addition to mines, which seem to be a particularly productive environment, the new minerals have been found to occur inside smelters, old geothermal piping, on the surfaces of archaeological artefacts, even inside museum specimen drawers.
The 208 man-mediated minerals are listed by Prof Hazen and colleagues in a paper just published by the American Mineralogist.
They have all been approved by the International Mineralogical Association. This organisation operates some quite tight definitions on the sorts of compounds that can appear among the 5,200 entries in the official catalogue. And the group that does not make the grade is the huge number of mineral-like materials that have been manufactured by humans for a specific purpose.
""Human synthesise thousands and thousands of materials - semi-conductors, and laser crystals, and magnets, and batteries, and building stone,"" said Prof Hazen.  ""These have mineral-like materials that will persist in the geological record for the next billion years.""
It is further evidence, if more were needed, that Earth has now entered a new epoch.
Currently, geologists label the time since the last ice age, 11,700 years ago, as the Holocene. But there is a push to introduce a new classification to reflect the immense, planet-wide changes driven by humans in recent decades - and for it to be called the Anthropocene Epoch.
The list of new man-mediated minerals bolsters the case.
Co-worker Marcus Origlieri from the University of Arizona commented: ""In the sediment layers left behind from our age, future mineralogists will find plentiful building materials such as bricks, cinder blocks, and cement, metal alloys such as steel, titanium, and aluminium, along with many lethal radioactive byproducts of the nuclear age. They might also marvel at some beautiful manufactured gemstones, like cubic zirconia, moissanite, synthetic rubies, and many others.""
And Edward Grew from the University of Maine added: ""These minerals and mineral-like compounds will be preserved in the geological record as a distinctive, globally distributed horizon of crystalline novelty - a persistent marker that marks our age as different from all that came before.""
Colin Waters, from the British Geological Survey, is secretary to the Anthropocene Working Group, which is the body trying to draw up detailed criteria to define the proposed new epoch.
He echoed the statements of Prof Hazen's team. The great changes occurring on Planet Earth were being reflected in the mineralogical record, just as they were in the chemistry of the atmosphere and the oceans, he said.
And Dr Waters highlighted the ball-point pen as an example.
""The ball at the end is made from tungsten carbide. Billions of them have been produced since the 1950s. Imagine how much of that material is knocking around the planet.
""We're ingenious at creating new mineral-like materials for our own purpose, and it is actually these that will be the voluminous signature of our presence on the planet, rather than some fairly obscure mineral that develops in a mine as a result of our excavation and then later alteration.""
Prof Hazen's team is part of the Deep Carbon Observatory, an international network of nearly 1000 multi-disciplinary scientists committed to investigating the quantities, movements, forms, and origins of carbon in deep Earth.

149,"He also cancelled an investigation into claims of abuse of power revealed by covert recordings, saying he wanted to ""put an end to the agony"" ahead of early elections in June.
But his move was condemned both by the opposition and by EU officials.
Macedonia has been in turmoil since the recordings were released in 2015.
In a televised address on Tuesday, President Ivanov said he acted to ""defend national interests"".
""I've decided to put an end to the agony and, metaphorically speaking, to cut a knot,'' he said, without referring to any politicians by name.
Opposition leader Zoran Zaev said the move was illegal, urging protesters to gather in the capital Skopje. A crowd of several hundred people later gathered outside the prosecutor's office.
Meanwhile, EU Enlargement Commissioner Johannes Hahn said: ""Today's actions of President Ivanov are not in line with my understanding of rule of law.""
Mr Hahn added that the move put Macedonia's EU membership ambitions at risk.
The crisis was sparked by covert recordings which appear to show ministers plotting vote-rigging and the cover-up of a murder.
Mr Zaev has been releasing a steady stream of recordings since February 2015, accusing the government of wiretapping 20,000 people, including politicians, journalists and religious leaders.
He says that scores of leaked recordings reveal corruption at the highest levels of government, including the mismanagement of funds, dubious criminal prosecutions of opponents and even cover-ups of killings.

Their delay was ordered after lists of candidates for Fatah, which dominates the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority, were cancelled in parts of the Gaza Strip, which is run by Hamas.
Hamas has protested at the court's ruling, describing it as ""political"".
Fatah said it held Hamas fully responsible.
Thursday's ruling by the high court in the West Bank city of Ramallah came after a Hamas-controlled court in Gaza disqualified several candidate lists drawn up by Fatah on technical grounds.
A challenge was also lodged by a lawyer over the inability to hold the vote in East Jerusalem, which Israel annexed after seizing it in the 1967 war but Palestinians want to be the capital of a future state.
""Elections can't take place in one place and not the other,"" said the presiding judge.
""The elections can't take place in Jerusalem and its neighbourhoods. Also, there are problems with the formation of courts in Gaza... Therefore, the court decides to stop the elections.""

151,"The Twickenham crowd watched England run in three tries within eight second-half minutes as the home side ran out comprehensive 38-21 winners.
Their previous biggest win over New Zealand was 13-0 at Twickenham in January 1936, while the most points they had ever registered against the All Blacks was the 31 they scored at the same venue in November 2002.
Only once in 498 Tests had New Zealand been beaten by a bigger margin (28-7). So, what have the pundits got to say about an England victory which very few saw coming?
""I can probably see this being maybe the greatest ever England victory, ever, at Twickenham. Nothing is springing to mind where they have annihilated the world's best team as they have today.
""I think I have been to every single England game at Twickenham since I was 14. This was by far the best game I've seen.
""It's the best performance by an England side considering the opposition and considering what this team has been through, particularly over the last two weeks. This was absolutely magnificent.
""Not only has this got to be the greatest game I've seen England play at Twickenham, we've got to put this among one of the world's greatest upsets, maybe even in any sport.

""It was an absolutely astonishing performance to win by 17 points. England harried, hounded and were just relentless. They said to New Zealand 'We will tackle you wherever you go and then we'll pinch the ball and see if we can live off scraps'. New Zealand cracked.
""It has been England's day - this is not about today not being New Zealand's day. England have put New Zealand under pressure and they defended not only for their lives but for the 80,000 people inside Twickenham and the millions watching at home. It has been relentless and they gave everything, epitomised by man of the match Tom Wood.
""People stepped up. Individuals stepped up one to 15, not just the odd player, particularly in that second half. It was wave after wave of England, whether it was defence or attack. That was the difference.""
Matt Dawson was speaking on BBC Radio 5 live.
""It was a fantastic Test match played with great energy. This England team has had a lot of flak over the past couple of weeks and they've got a lot of pride back in the shirt.
""The crowd just buzzed off it and it was wonderful to be here.
""What I liked about the start was that when England walked on the field there wasn't a lot of song and dance about it, they knew they had to do a job and they took the game to New Zealand.
""I said beforehand, if you're going to beat the best teams in the world, indeed become the best in the world, you've got to have self-belief and for me they played with that self-belief today. They took the game to New Zealand and deserved the victory.

""Looking at the first half, New Zealand will rue a couple of those missed penalties but psychologically England just built it and built it.
""There was still room to improve - Ashton missed an opportunity in the corner, Tuilagi forced the ball - but this team today gelled. They got opportunities and took them - to me that's what Test match rugby is about.
""It's very easy to look back at the past but England's 31-28 win against the All Blacks in 2002 was the day we actually said 'we are the top team in the world'. It was a massive transformation from which England then built for the next few years.
""Hopefully we'll look back at this day not just as a great day for English rugby, but the day this team really grew up.""
Josh Lewsey was speaking on BBC Three.
""Absolutely unbelievable. Not just to get the victory, but the best victory England have ever had against the All Blacks. No-one saw it coming, but maybe this England team did.
""They played absolutely magnificently well, not just scoring penalties to build the score in the first half, but try after try in the second half. It was quite extraordinary.
""Chris Robshaw was a hero - he deserves all the credit he will get. In the same way England were lambasted in defeat, when they play well - which they did, they were heroic - they should take a huge round of applause.
""They got themselves 15-0 up and then conceded two soft tries, but the way they came back at New Zealand was so impressive.
""The All Blacks looked shell-shocked at the end.""
Lawrence Dallaglio was speaking on BBC Three
""It was a fantastic win. It was a great to be there, one of best games I ever seen at Twickenham.
""It was the All Blacks against England who were coming off two average defeats. The scoreline reflected the performance. It was a great day for England.
""I think because it was the last of the games in the series and what happened in the match means it was a David versus Goliath effort.
""England got stuck into New Zealand early on and they were rattled. A key point was when Conrad Smith came flying out and England went through.

152,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP.
It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada.
It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law.
One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments.
There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them.
This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements.
Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries.
Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn).
In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.
John Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"".
The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.
The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.
The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.

In July, Mr Machar's bodyguards and President Salva Kiir's presidential guards fought each other, sparking days of violence.
Hundreds of people died and more than 100,000 fled across the border.
The fighting erupted less than a year after a peace deal was signed to form a unity government and end the civil war.

156,"Jayden Stockley headed wide from Jonny Hayes' cross early in the second half and Rangers quickly capitalised on that miss when Kenny Miller tucked in.
A powerful Lee Hodson shot doubled the home side's advantage.
The hosts' Clint Hill and Aberdeen's Ryan Jack were each dismissed for two bookings, with Andrew Considine heading a late consolation for the Dons.
The Ibrox side had started the day level on points with Hearts but trailing them on goal difference.
However, with Hearts held to a draw by Ross County, Mark Warburton's side go two points ahead of the Tynecastle side and remain eight behind leaders Celtic.
Rangers had lost at Hearts in midweek while Aberdeen were coming off a 3-0 defeat by Celtic in Sunday's League Cup final, with the Dons aiming to end a 25-year wait for a win at Ibrox.
But that run continues with Warburton's side winning by the same scoreline that they lost by at Aberdeen's Pittodrie in September.
The visitors had their chances in Glasgow with James Maddison - who scored a stunning free-kick winner in the sides' last meeting - seeing a set-piece effort bounce wide.
Stockley got a foot to a Graeme Shinnie cross to draw a save from Wes Foderingham and came close to putting Derek McInnes' side ahead three minutes after the break.
Hayes got round his man to cross from the left but Stockley could not direct his header from six yards on target.
Maddison failed to get a hold of a couple of shots before Rangers' second but the midfielder did deliver the free-kick for Considine's goal.
Captain Lee Wallace fired wide in the hosts' best first-half advance and it was the composure of Miller that finally broke the deadlock.
Moments after Stockley's miss, 36-year-old striker Miller, deployed in midfield, latched on to Joe Garner's speculative cross and finished first time.
Barrie McKay had the vision to find Hodson inside the box amid a spell of pressure and the Northern Ireland international lashed a shot into the roof of the net for Rangers' second, having started ahead of regular right-back James Tavernier.
McKay's replacement Harry Forrester forced a save from Joe Lewis as the pressure continued.
Defender Hill had earlier escaped unpunished following a risky challenge on Shinnie inside his own box but bookings for fouls on Maddison resulted in the 38-year-old's dismissal.
Jack, 24, followed Hill up the tunnel after being cautioned in the wake of a lengthy spell of pushing following a Rangers foul, the Dons skipper having earlier been booked for impeding Michael O'Halloran.
And there were further bookings in stoppage time to take the tally to 11.
Rangers' Mark Warburton: ""The players were more than irked by comments made about them, by comments questioning their battling qualities and their desire.
""But they responded really well, there was a lot of nonsense written about them and they more than answered those questions.
""First half nobody really controlled the game, it was pretty neutral. But, second half, we stepped on and won second balls and I felt we deserved to win.""
Aberdeen's Derek McInnes: ""From penalty box to penalty box I thought we were the better team.
""We really got after Rangers, we pressed them high, we were competitive, we were winning tackles, we were fully committed. I thought we really frustrated them.
""But we said to the players at half-time, it was important in the final third to carry more of a threat ourselves,. We got in good areas and rushed that last wee bit.
""We had more opportunities to apply pressure with the ball rather than just without the ball, and Rangers scored when we were having our best spell.
""We started the second half really on the front foot, got into good areas, still should be doing more with it, but Jayden's is clearly the one we all remember.
""It was a good stand-up from Jonny and Jayden would normally eat that type of service up, but he misses. It happens but unfortunately for us it was pivotal.""

160,"Ansar al-Sharia demanded the authorities release Islamist fighters from jail in exchange for the soldiers' safe return.
The announcement came only days after a series of suicide attacks and armed assaults by the group in southern Yemen left more than 100 people dead, most of them soldiers.
It had previously warned that it was going to launch a series of attacks on the authorities, dubbed the ""Flooding River"".
Ansar al-Sharia, whose name means ""Partisans of Islamic law"" in Arabic, was formed by AQAP in response to the growing youth movement in Yemen, which has marginalised Salafi-jihadists who advocate the violent overthrow of the government and the establishment of an Islamic state.
Mass, peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations have swept the Arab world in the past year, not least in Yemen, where they eventually forced President Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over power to his deputy in November.
Last April, jihadist websites published an interview with AQAP's religious leader, Adel al-Abbab - also known as Abu al-Zubair - who said that Ansar al-Sharia had been set up to attract people to Sharia rule in the areas under the control of AQAP and allied groups, including ""Islamic"" punishments.
In the past year, militants linked to AQAP have seized parts of the southern province of Abyan, including the provincial capital, Zinjibar.
Ansar al-Sharia says it provides public services to locals in such areas and claims to solve their day-to-day problems.
It says it is reproducing the model of Sharia rule espoused by the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Islamic State of Iraq, a militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda in Iraq.

161,"That's why so many Labour MPs feared a miscalculation when their party's leader brought his old comrade back into the fold.
But his staggering comments today about Hitler and anti-Semitism crossed a line - they were enough for Jeremy Corbyn to suspend him.
But the problem for the leader doesn't end with that act.
No one believes that Jeremy Corbyn himself tolerates discrimination against Jews.
But on repeated occasions Labour has been slow and clumsy in closing down cases of anti-Semitism among its members when they emerge.
Any moments of delay or doubts about the leadership's determination, open the window a tiny crack to the kind of intolerance that the vast majority of the Labour Party, and indeed the public, find appalling.
Public denials that there is even a issue could make it even worse. Perhaps in politics as in normal life, the first step towards fixing a problem is acknowledging that it exists.
And with only a week before Jeremy Corbyn's first big test at the polls, In elections in London, Scotland, Wales, and al round England, it's the kind of mess, and political distraction Labour could do without.",For years it has been more surprising when Ken Livingstone hasn't raised hackles than when he has.,36165368,"The article argues that Jeremy Corbyn's decision to reinstate a Labour Party member who made anti-Semitic comments has sparked concern among MPs that the party is not taking allegations of anti-Semitism seriously, leading to a political distraction and damage to the party's reputation just a week before important elections.",1,"Article: {}

162,"Members were unable to reach a compromise after eight hours of talks.
The committee had considered plans - backed by deputy Leader Tom Watson - to reinstate elections to the shadow cabinet. Since 2011, the party leader has selected his own top team.
Mr Watson said the proposal could help Labour ""put the band back together"" for a possible early election.
A proposal  to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday's leadership election result was voted down, by 16 votes to 15.
Mr Corbyn was among those to vote against it, but did agree to further talks with Mr Watson and other senior figures before the next NEC meeting this weekend, at the party's conference in Liverpool.
Mr Watson said afterwards that it was a ""very positive meeting"".
He added: ""We agreed 22 changes to our rules and guidance, all sorts of positive things I'm sure the media will be really interested in.""
Many MPs see elections as a way of constraining Mr Corbyn, should he be re-elected as leader, and ensuring a balance of opinion at Labour's top table.
Supporters of Mr Corbyn say any plan should call for party members and activists to also have a say in any elections.
The Labour leader has said there is a ""thirst for democracy"" in the party and he backs a ""widening of the franchise"".
Mr Watson also called for Labour's leadership election rules to be changed to exclude registered supporters who pay a one-off fee to vote.
He described their participation as ""unpopular"" and suggested a return to a franchise of party members, trade unionists and MPs.
In last year's contest, 84% of the 105,598 registered supporters who paid Â£3 to vote backed Jeremy Corbyn.
This time around, they were asked to pay Â£25 to take part.
Despite the increased fee, 129,000 people are thought to have applied successfully for a one-off vote in the contest between Mr Corbyn and his challenger Owen Smith - the result of which will be announced on Saturday.
Registered supporters were given a say in the choice of leader as a result of changes brought in by Ed Miliband, and approved by the party in 2013, designed to open up the process to a wider audience.
Critics have said it allowed the leadership election to be hijacked by far-left groups with their own agenda - although Mr Corbyn easily won the most support among all groups - including party members, trade unionists and other affiliated supporters.
Mr Watson, who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise, said the reforms had been ""rushed"" and ""unpopular"".
He suggested a return to the previous system used to elect Mr Miliband and his predecessors - in which voting was limited to an electoral college of party members, trade unionists, affiliate supporters and elected representatives of the party.
""We created a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that and we want also want to enfranchise ordinary trade unionists in the process,"" he said.
Mr Watson said he did not want the changes to be seen as a threat to Mr Corbyn and suggested they would only apply after he stood down, whenever that may be.
But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move would be seen as an attempt to make it much harder for a left winger like Mr Corbyn to be elected.

The force said eight arrests have been made in the capital and in Birmingham - three women and five men - with searches at addresses in Brighton and south east London having now concluded.
Earlier, police formally identified the man believed to have been responsible for the Westminster attack as Masood, a 52-year-old from Kent who was born Adrian Elms and who was thought to have most recently been living in the West Midlands.
Police said Masood was not the subject of any existing investigations and there was ""no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack"".

""It would normally be common for an orchestra to be in existence for five or six years before they appear,"" said Pickard.
But he said it was ""very important to mark"" the ""significance of Chineke! and what they are doing,"" in showcasing the talent of under-represented performers.

Notably, the 2017 season has nothing as populist as last year's Strictly Prom, or previous years' diversions into grime and dance music.
""I don't want the Proms to be something that repeats things for the sake of repeating them,"" said Pickard, adding he wanted to ""find new ways of getting new audiences"".
""And things like the John Williams prom will hopefully do the same thing that a Doctor Who Prom might do, which is to bring in an audience that might be drawn in by the films they've seen, but will hear music they love played by an orchestra.""
2017 marks 90 years since the BBC took over running and financing the Proms, and 70 years since the famous Last Night was broadcast on television.
It has commissioned 30 new works, 13 of which are by female composers, while three female conductors will make their first Proms appearance.
Although he admitted there was still work to be done, Pickard said the diversity of this year's performers and composers wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago.
""The Proms is a leader in classical music and people look to us for the things we're doing,"" he said. ""And whilst we can't bear that responsibility alone, I think it's incredibly important we take the lead.""
All of this year's concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3, and more than 20 will be filmed for television or iPlayer. The BBC is also experimenting with lossless audio - by streaming the season in CD quality via the BBC Proms website.

If Donald Trump is going to win the Republican nomination without a convention fight, he will have to endure yet another string of political blows that would stagger even the strongest campaign.
A week before a key primary in Wisconsin, Scott Walker - the state's governor - gave a full-throated endorsement of rival Ted Cruz. Now Mr Lewandowski has been charged over his manhandling of a female reporter during a rally. This comes after a particularly tawdry few days in the Republican presidential battle as Mr Trump and Mr Cruz engaged in a war of words over their spouses.
The New York property developer has been able to maintain his front-runner status for months despite countless controversies and conflagrations. This time may be different, however.
Recent events are likely to cause further damage to Mr Trump's already poor standing with female voters. The Republican presidential pack has been whittled to just three candidates, with the not-Trump vote consolidating behind Mr Cruz.
Mr Trump's path to securing the Republican nomination is a narrow one, so the slightest stumble could deny him the prize outright. Then it's on to the convention, where party loyalists and a growing cadre of Cruz-friendly activists hold sway.
The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week's Wisconsin primary where he is neck-and-neck with Senator Ted Cruz.
Earlier on Tuesday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker endorsed Mr Cruz for president.
Mr Trump will participate in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night when all three Republican contenders will face questions.
He is currently well ahead in the Republican race with 739 delegates to Cruz's 465.

It comes after Mr Carswell said in an article in the Times on Saturday that Mr Farage ""needs to take a break now"".
A bitter internal row has developed within UKIP after Mr Farage's resignation was rejected by the party.
Mr Carswell said: ""I'm suggesting he takes a break as leader. I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.
""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body.
""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.
""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""
The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.
He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.
Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.
UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.
Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.
In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".

175,"It is their first competitive action since the ICC World Twenty20 in March, when they beat Hong Kong to record a first win at a major tournament.
""Winning that last game against Hong Kong was pretty crucial for us,"" batsman Coetzer told BBC Scotland.
""Coming away with that against our name was hugely important.""
That eight-wicket triumph took its time too - 21 attempts over 18 years - and the 32-year-old thinks more fixtures against higher-ranking teams like Afghanistan are vital if they are to continue building on that hard-fought success.
""The schedule is very bare at the moment and, if you are trying to produce players to compete against the top 12 nations in the world, that's going to be very hard to do if you're not playing any cricket,"" said Coetzer.
Scotland and Afghanistan met during the World T20 in Nagpur in March, when this week's visitors secured a 14-run victory along with qualification from the group stages, where they also beat the eventual winners West Indies.
But Coetzer believes the Scots are coming at this series, being played at The Grange in Edinburgh on Monday and Wednesday, with the strongest squad they have probably ever had.
""We've got some options with the bat and some more options with the ball now, so it's really given us a more rounded squad,"" said the vice-captain.
And, after that win over Hong Kong the team, led by Preston Mommsen, will be ""quietly confident"" they can put pressure on the visitors in what he thinks will be a ""tightly contested"" series.
With the temperature in Afghanistan hitting the mid-30s, Coetzer believes there could be an advantage against the team ranked 10th in the world.
""At training, they all turned up well wrapped up as it's only 13 degrees and I guess that's not what they're used to,"" he said.
""The pitch conditions too, the wicket may well suit our players and hopefully things like that will go in our favour - you've got to make your home ground a fortress wherever that is and that's The Grange at the minute.""
Someone who has a heads-up on the disappointment of a Scottish summer is Lalchand Rajput - the former India and Scotland international who has taken charge of Afghanistan for their tour of Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The 54-year-old from Mumbai spent 10 seasons with Perthshire and another five with Strathmore and may know a thing or two about July temperatures here.
While Rajput has been quoted as calling Scotland his second home, that fondness will be swept aside as he takes the reins for the first time against the Scots, although Coetzer claims they are not expecting any massive surprises.
Having tasted success on the world stage this year, Scotland are hoping to use that to build excitement around the sport nationally.
That is perhaps hindered somewhat by the fact they do not play again until 14 and 16 August against the United Arab Emirates in Aberdeen.
""We are in a little tricky stage at the moment as our fixtures are few and far between,"" Coetzer told BBC Scotland. ""That's the challenge we face with reducing funding from the International Cricket Council (ICC).
""It's challenging when players are trying to be professional, but you can only be together for one day leading into this series.
""That's no preparation for a one-day series, so we do have a lot of work to do in this country.""","Scotland vice-captain Kyle Coetzer believes the ""monkey is off their backs"" when they host Afghanistan in two one-day internationals this week.",36699668,"Scotland is set to face Afghanistan in a two-match one-day international series at The Grange in Edinburgh, with the Scots looking to build on their recent victory over Hong Kong and the Afghan team led by Preston Mommsen hoping to make the most of their advantageous conditions due to the hot temperatures in Scotland.",1,"Article: {}

It was an official confirmation of Irish ancestry, aimed at those who do not qualify for full citizenship.
However, as few as 3,000 certificates have been sold since the 2011 launch.
In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs said: ""The uptake of the Certificate of Irish Heritage has been considerably less than anticipated.
""No further certificates will be available for purchase after 24 August 2015.""
The department said the scheme had been set up to encourage people of Irish descent to trace their family roots and to give ""greater practical expression to the sense of Irish identity felt by many around the world"".
Previous recipients have included a number of high-profile figures, including US President Barack Obama, former US President Bill Clinton and the Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.
Applicants were asked to provide details of their Irish ancestors online, so their ancestry could be verified through record checks.
The certificates cost 45 euros (Â£32) or 120 euros (Â£85) for a framed version, but the Department of Foreign Affairs said it never anticipated that the scheme ""would provide significant revenue to the government"".

The policemen were found guilty of staging a pre-arranged extrajudicial killing known as a fake encounter.
Encounters are partly a response to India's slow and dysfunctional criminal justice system, correspondents say.
Police often see cases evaporate as trials are delayed and witnesses turn hostile.
The latest high-profile case to come to court dates back 25 years ago to when a group of Sikh families, including children, was travelling by bus through the state Uttar Pradesh in northern India after visiting holy sites.
Police officers stopped the bus in Pilibhit and forced some of the men to get out.
Later, joined by more policemen, they divided the Sikh men into groups, led them into the jungle and shot them dead.
Why India's 'fake encounters' are shockingly common
Afterwards, police lied about what happened. They claimed that the men were militants and armed - at the time, there had been a spate of attacks in the region by Sikh groups fighting for a separate homeland.
The Central Bureau for Investigation (CBI) said that the motive for the killings was to earn awards and recognition for killing ""terrorists"", NDTV reported.
The court in sentencing the men said that police officers who were holding important posts must be behind the killings , but the CBI had kept them away from the investigation, The Indian Express reported,
The court said that the CBI officer investigating the case was not fully free to take decisions relating to it without constantly referring to his senior officers and that several people who should have been accused were instead set free or not charged.
Relatives of those killed protested outside the courtroom against the sentences, which they argued were too lenient.

The men needed regular visits because they could suffer a relapse which could put the public at risk.
Ms Doherty denied any wrongdoing but three allegations were found proven.
A fourth charge of acting ""dishonestly"" was found not proven.
The hearing was told Ms Doherty worked for Vale of Glamorgan council as a senior social worker and had years of experience.
Part of her job was to make sure people who had committed ""significant crimes"" but were living in the community, complied with Crown Court orders issued under the Mental Health Act.
Ms Doherty said visits had happened every six weeks but council mental health services manager Andrew Cole, giving evidence on the first of a two-day hearing, said the visits were less frequent.
""[This led] to a potential increased risk of somebody's mental health deteriorating and an escalation in their behaviour - which is more likely to go undetected,"" he said.
Mr Cole also said the minimum four-week frequency of visits was set by doctors and would have been ""clearly marked"" on official documents.
In her evidence, Ms Doherty told the panel she often had an excessive work-load, inadequate management support and often felt ""left out on a limb"".
The hearing was also told that bereavement had caused her to ""burn out"" and that her life had become ""chaotic"" as a result.

YAS said waiting time ""was one of the most significant issues"" it faced.
A shortage of available hospital beds has been given as one of the problems causing knock-on delays at A&E.
Dr David Macklin, Executive Director of Operations at YAS, said handover waiting times were ""a system problem"" for the NHS, not just in Yorkshire, and said blame could not be attached to individual hospitals.
""We have numerous occasions where we have multiple vehicles queued at hospitals,"" he said.
""Emergency departments across Yorkshire are working incredibly hard to manage their demand and that means sometimes ambulances are queuing.
""Patients who are not seriously injured may need to wait.""
Professor Keith Willett from NHS England said the increase in waiting times was ""concerning"" and added there were ""a multitude of reasons"" for the rise.
""One of the biggest problems is the pressure on the beds in the hospital,"" he said.
""That's because the hospitals are finding it increasingly difficult to move patients and their care back into the community.""
The figures were supplied after a Freedom of Information request by the BBC.
Just five hospitals - one each in East, South and West Yorkshire and two in North Yorkshire - accounted for about 70% of the total waiting time.
The handover time is counted only after 15 minutes have elapsed at A&E.

180,"Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday.
Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent ""excessive"" journeys.
The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed.
Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs.
""Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,"" she said. ""Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.""
Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey.
The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that:
The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work.
The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures.
Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August.
Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine.
""It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,"" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol.
Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip.
""I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,"" he said.
Mr Seymour, 43, said the Â£5,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating.
""I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,"" he said.
The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains.
""It can be a daily nightmare,"" he said. ""I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.""
Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains.
Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London.
He says spending his ""14th winter"" on the bicycle is worth it to save ""several thousands of pounds a year"" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership.
""I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,"" he said.
Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme.
""But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,"" he said.
Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London.
In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital.
Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be ""excessive"", and instead travelled to London a few times a month.

181,"The Project Loon team, part of the company’s X research lab, said it was now able to use machine learning to predict weather systems.
It means the firm has far greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe.
Clustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google’s “captain of moonshots”, Astro Teller, told reporters.
""We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,” he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously.
“Real users” will be able to use the system in the “coming months”, he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place.
Rural ambition
Google’s aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas.
Rather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons.
The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction.
By using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time.
Last last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months.
Spin off
Over the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas.
Last month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work.
Mr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more “mature” moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in “no rush” to make Project Loon a stand-alone business.
“The service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,” he said.
""Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go. That has made the prospects of Loon even better than we had anticipated.”
Falling out of the sky
One key hurdle for the company to overcome is the reliability of its balloons. To date, the record for continuous balloon flight has been 190 days.
At a research lab within Google’s campus in Mountain View, California, development teams painstakingly analyse each failed balloons on a huge scanner nicknamed “Billie Jean” owning to light panels reminiscent of the illuminating pavement in Michael Jackson’s iconic music video.
Other technologies trying to achieve similar goals have been tested by Google and others. The company recently shut down Project Titan, an effort to use solar-powered drones to deliver connectivity to a wide area. The programme was cancelled owing to economic and technology difficulties, the company said.
Facebook has attempted to work with similar technology. It’s Project Aquila drone, which is being developed in the UK, suffered a major setback when one of its craft crashed last June.
On the challenge facing Project Loon, Mr Teller admitted that many at the company did not think it would ever actually work.
“If we’d known how hard it was going to be, we probably never would have tried,” he wrote in a blog post published on Thursday.

In March, British Cycling apologised for any ""failings"" in its performance programme and promised to be more caring to riders following accusations of sexism and bullying.
But Wales' Barker, who won silver medals in the madison and scratch races at the championships, said she could not have achieved her success in Hong Kong without the support of British Cycling.

185,"Sunderland's Giaccherini slotted home in the first half after collecting Leonardo Bonucci's superb long pass.
Southampton's Pelle sealed the win in injury time with an emphatic volley following an incisive break.
Belgium were very disappointing, with Romelu Lukaku and Divock Origi wasteful in front of goal.
Everton forward Lukaku curled over from the edge of the box with just the keeper to beat while Liverpool's Origi missed two opportunities to head his side level.
Before the tournament began some pundits condemned this Italy squad for a lack of quality, and even coach Antonio Conte said: ""It isn't a good time for our football.""
The soon-to-be-Chelsea boss added: ""It's important the squad has a good spirit. I work a lot at this.""
On the evidence of this game, that is not the only thing he has worked at.
Italy's triumph was a result of superior organisation and discipline against 11 Belgian individuals who appear to possess, on paper at least, the greater talent.
Both sides now face games against the Republic of Ireland and Sweden, who drew 1-1 in the Group E opener earlier on Monday.
With 16 of 24 teams progressing from the group stage, Italy took a huge step towards advancing with victory against their likeliest challengers.
Italy have won this competition once, in 1968, and finished runners-up twice - most recently in 2012, when they were demolished 4-0 by Spain in the final.
While the current Azzurri side went unbeaten through qualifying, winning seven of their 10 matches, they compare unfavourably with the side of four years ago, lacking the calm, creative brilliance of Andrea Pirlo in midfield and an attacking spearhead to adequately replace a faded Mario Balotelli.
What they do have is a meticulous and tactically astute coach in the Chelsea-bound Conte and a stubborn Juventus-centric defence.
Such a foundation allowed them to limit and frustrate Belgium, leaving them vulnerable to one piece of ruthless counter-attacking brilliance - which Bonucci's 50-yard, defence-splitting pass and Giaccherini's cool finish provided.
The second half would have been more comfortable for Italy had a second goal been scored from an unmarked position by Pelle, who also had a second header saved by Thibaut Courtois after the break.
However, Conte's imperious rearguard held firm before Pelle volleyed home a neat chipped cross from Antonio Candreva.
Despite only having qualified for one major tournament in the past 14 years, Belgium came to France as Europe's top-ranked side and one of the favourites to triumph in Paris on 10 July.
Their status is built around the attacking potential and club-forged reputation of individuals such as Kevin de Bruyne, Eden Hazard and Lukaku, as opposed to consistent evidence of a cohesive international team.
However, the Red Devils did little to suggest they are ready to convert this promise into something concrete on the big stage.
They were pedestrian in the first half, failing to get in behind the Italian backline, with De Bruyne particularly isolated.
They upped the speed after the break but still struggled to test Gianluigi Buffon, with Lukaku curling over a good chance and substitute Origi spurning two glorious headed opportunities.
Equally as worrying for Belgium was the performance of their defence.
Already without the injured Vincent Kompany, they looked particularly vulnerable with Jan Vertonghen deployed at left-back instead of alongside his Tottenham colleague Toby Alderweireld in the centre.
Italy coach Antonio Conte: ""What we demonstrated tonight is that there were two teams who played exciting football, with changes at both ends. It proves that nothing is already written in football, and it is on the field where you have to make your point.
""In a tournament like this, you need an alchemy, of people who get on well together and the biggest satisfaction for me tonight is to see how happy they all were, also those on the bench. There's a very good spirit in this squad.""
Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois: ""Now we have to win the other two matches and be a better team. Italy outclassed us in organisation, and tactically they were the best team.""
BBC pundit and former Italy striker Gianluca Vialli: ""I don't want to brag, but we were almost perfect. We dominated the game, we showed desire and commitment and we played like a team. We had a perfect game plan.""
BBC pundit and ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand: ""That was a perfect example of one playing like a team, the other like a group of individuals. What was so impressive is the way they can go from defence to attack so quickly.""

187,"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.
The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.
In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.
Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.
It can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.
That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.
The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.
The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.
""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.
""Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News.
Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.
The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.
The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.
Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.
The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.
More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.
There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.
OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.
Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.
""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger.
""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.""
One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.
The fear is that space could eventually become unusable.
A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.
Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.
""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News.
""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.""
Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.
Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.
""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.

192,"But his killing in an air strike is a grievous strategic error - militarily insignificant but diplomatically disastrous.
Towards the end of April, Nato states made a number of operational innovations. Three member states - Britain, France, and Italy - injected military advisers into rebel-held eastern Libya. Another, the US, began continuous patrols of armed drones.
Third, and most important, air strikes began to target command, control, communications and intelligence networks (known, in military parlance, as C3I). The Bab al-Aziziya compound includes all three such networks, and it was presumed that their disruption would disorient regime soldiers on the front line, cut off field commanders from Tripoli, and sow confusion in the ranks.
But was the strike also an assassination attempt?
Assassination of a head of state is illegal under international law, and forbidden by various US presidential orders. On the other hand, the targeted killing of those woven into the enemy chain of command is shrouded in legal ambiguity.
Given the personalistic nature of the regime, and the ""all means necessary"" clause in UN Resolution 1973, it might be argued that killing Col Muammar Gaddafi and certain members of his family - such as his son Khamis, commander of an elite military brigade - would be permissible, even if it posed a risk to those non-combatants around the regime.
Legality, though, indicates neither legitimacy nor prudence. This strike, and the death of Saif al-Arab, have produced little military result at the greatest diplomatic and symbolic cost to Nato.
Saif al-Arab was, unlike his brothers, not a senior military commander or propagandist. His death is redolent of the 1986 US strike on the same compound.
That raid killed a girl who Col Gaddafi later claimed was his adopted daughter and, in the scarred buildings and craters, furnished him with a long-lasting symbol of defiance.
The propaganda value of such unintended deaths is potentially severe.
In the 1991 Gulf War, a US stealth bomber directed two bombs at what was claimed to be a command-and-control bunker, but was in fact an Iraqi civilian shelter.
The result was 315 deaths, including 130 children. Col Gaddafi, like Saddam Hussein before him, will take every opportunity to exploit such errors to paint Western powers as indiscriminate aggressors.
Moreover, this is no longer a conventional war in which top-down direction is crucial. Pro-Gaddafi forces in both the besieged western city of Misrata and in the east have adapted to Nato's air power and are using increasingly unorthodox tactics.
They need not rely on a stream of detailed orders from Tripoli, and can cause considerable harm to civilians without this guidance.
Nato is understandably frustrated at the diminishing returns of air strikes, since it has destroyed most accessible targets. But killing commanders and disrupting communications is far less important than the key task of degrading heavy military equipment, such as tanks and artillery.
If the strike had killed Col Gaddafi himself, would it then have been at least a military success?
One of the greatest mistakes of the Iraq war was assuming that, with the departure of Saddam Hussein, the state apparatus could simply be transferred to new ownership.
Col Gaddafi's death could see Saif al-Islam Gaddafi take the reins, galvanise supporters, and continue the war with equal intensity. It would be dangerous and short-sighted to portray even effective assassination as a silver bullet.
Perhaps, though, the demonstration to the regime that no safe haven exists, and that only capitulation would bring security, justified these risks?
There is no doubt that, along with the military aim of disrupting command-and-control hubs, Nato sought a psychological effect, conscious of the possibility of ""accidental assassination"".
The problem is that the direction of this effect is unclear. The dramatic visual impact of this air strike, and the death of those disconnected from political and military leadership, will harden the diplomatic opposition to the war, from Russia and China amongst others.
More consequentially, it will anger the alliance's warier members, like Germany and Turkey, and inflame parts of Arab and African public opinion.
It may eventually leave Britain and France bearing the military burden alone, with modest but limited assistance from a cagey US administration eager to keep at arm's length from this European war.
Col Gaddafi's overarching strategy has never been to win a conventional war, but to induce symbolically prominent casualties, drive a wedge between more committed and more ambivalent members of the coalition, and knock away the pillars of political support on which this intervention was built.
Thus far, the coalition had sought, rightly, to purchase coalition longevity at the price of campaign intensity. If that balance continues to shift towards the latter, Nato runs the risk of playing into the regime's hands.

194,"It carries the simple name e-Delicious, and it takes the form of a box about the size of a large printer, containing sensors, and some computer circuitry, which act as an electronic tongue and nose.
It was developed by Thailand's National Innovation Agency, at a total cost of $1m (£640,000), after former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinwatra complained about the poor versions of Thai food she was subjected to during her overseas trips.
A Thai Delicious committee was formed - a bit like the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for food and wine - and around 200 people were invited to sample different versions of classic Thai dishes like tom yum gung (sour prawn soup) and kaeng khiao wan (green curry).
Whichever version was the consensus winner was taken as the standard, although the designers acknowledge that as the sampling was done in Bangkok, inevitably their standards for now are Bangkok versions.
The e-Delicious machine has nine sensors in it to measure the balance of six Thai flavours - sweet, sour, bitter, salty, savoury and spicy - and the food's aroma.
There is also a sensor to assess the dish's visual presentation, which is always very important in Thai cooking.
But can it actually tell you if the dish is any good?
""The machine can't tell you if something is delicious or not,"" says Nakah Thawichawatt, an entrepreneur who carries the grand title of Innovation Ambassador.
""The sensors give a taste-reading that we can understand. So if we like a certain taste, but can't explain what that taste is to someone else, the machine will able to decipher it, and record the data as a standard for other dishes.""
We decided to give the e-Delicious a test. We had seen it sample low-cost versions of the recipes in its database - only three for now, but soon to reach 10 - and found them all wanting.
But how would it cope with the tom yum gung that is judged by many in Bangkok to be the finest in the city?
You won't find it in a ritzy restaurant in Bangkok's upmarket neighbourhoods, where Italian or Japanese cuisine is popular.
Jay Fai, a formidable-looking woman in trademark beanie-hat and fire-engine slash of lipstick, is sometimes called the Mozart of the Wok, for the lightning speed and instinctive flair with which she wields that most essential tool for East Asian cooking.
Her pad kee mao, or drunken noodles, is renowned: thick strips of white rice noodles fried in seconds over a roaring charcoal brazier, the meat, seafood, vegetables and chillies seared, glazed and smoky.
But it is her tom yum gung they queue up for, despite a price tag that reaches $50 (£32) for a large bowl.
Jay Fai tells me she learned her recipes from the old women who used to cook for the community on the village where she grew up.
She is meticulous about ingredients, searching for the very freshest jumbo prawns, the most fragrant herbs - and tom yum gung relies a great deal on the galangal, lemon grass and lime leaves that flavour it, along with the fermented fish sauce, tamarind, lime juice, chillies and red onions.
Watching her hurling great handfuls of herbs into the furiously boiling pot, it is hard to see any precision.
And yet, after a couple of minutes she produces a soup of exquisite, overpowering taste and aroma. Once eaten, never forgotten, and for this reviewer, never equalled.
At the Thai Delicious lab we spooned some of Jay Fai's soup into two glass beakers - one for taste, one for smell - and slid them into the e-Delicious machine.
After a minute's processing, it delivered its verdict; for taste, 90%. For aroma, 100% - the highest score of any tom yum gung it had assessed.
So perhaps a machine can judge great cooking.
For a final view I called the chef at the first Thai restaurant ever to win a Michelin star: David Thompson, a true global culinary celebrity.
His Bangkok restaurant Nahm has repeatedly been voted as one of the world's finest.
""It's an impossible dream, to set one standard,"" he said. ""Taste is so subjective.""
""There are standards, but the art of cooking is the epitome of humanity, with differences in taste, seasoning and technique that express the cook's character.""
And what about a taste robot?
""It's a gimmick, a foolish idea,"" he said. ""Any cook, any sound practitioner or craftsman knows that a robot can never analyse the product of the human hand.""
The developers of the e-Delicious machine are undeterred.
Despite its high cost - at least $18,000 (£11,455) per unit - they hope they can sell a few to each country where Thai food has taken off, to offer at least a consistent standard by which Thai restaurants can come and have their versions of the Thai classics judged.
And if that does not take off, they have also come up with a Thai Delicious app for smartphones.","At a small laboratory in a Bangkok suburb, a group of scientists has come up with what they hope is the answer to an old conundrum: how to tell if a Thai dish is authentic or not.",30110282,"Thailand's National Innovation Agency has developed an ""e-Delicious"" machine that can analyze and standardize the taste and aroma of Thai dishes, using sensors and computer circuitry to measure the balance of six Thai flavors and the dish's visual presentation, with the ability to distinguish high-quality versions of classic Thai dishes like tom yum gung, but the developers of the machine acknowledge that it cannot replace human taste and preferences, and plans to sell the machine to Thai restaurants and offer a Thai Delicious app for smartphones.",0,"Article: {}

However, public debate has also evolved to accept the hijab as an expression of individual liberties, correspondents say.
No strong opposition has been voiced against this latest move.
President Erdogan has long embraced Turks' right to express their religious beliefs openly, but he says he is committed to secularism.
In 2010, the country's universities abandoned an official ban on Muslim headscarves.
Three years later, women were allowed to wear headscarves in state institutions - with the exception of the judiciary, military and police. That year, four MPs wore headscarves in parliament.

Fury upset Klitschko last November to secure the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles but was charged by the UK Anti-Doping Agency (Ukad) in June.
A provisional suspension was lifted pending an independent investigation.
Fury, who fights Klitschko at the Manchester Arena, has denied any wrongdoing and threatened to sue Ukad.
Co-promoter Frank Warren said: ""After all the injuries and contractual problems, there is no danger of the fight not happening.""
I'm just waiting for my revenge. I'm obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back.
The road to Fury-Klitschko II has been a rocky one. It was originally scheduled for July before the 28-year-old Englishman turned an ankle in training.
In June, the media got wind that Fury and his cousin Hughie, also a heavyweight boxer, had been charged with a doping offence after the banned substance nandrolone was allegedly discovered in their urine samples.
However, the samples were taken 19 months ago, nine months before Fury outpointed his Ukrainian rival, 40, in Dusseldorf.
Fury claims he was told by Ukad that he would face no action over the test and that a blood test taken at the time, as well as all tests since, revealed no traces. Hughie's case will also be reviewed by the National Anti-Doping Panel.
Fury's long-time promoter Mick Hennessy said he was ""very, very confident"" that his fighter would be exonerated after the investigation.
Fury did not attend Monday's news conference in London because his car broke down on the way down from his home in Morecambe.
But his uncle and trainer Peter Fury said the boxer was ""very upset"" with Ukad and the way he has been treated by the British public.
""There's been chaos around this fight, especially with Ukad slipping statements out to the press,"" said Peter Fury.
""Tyson was found guilty before he was even tried. But I told him that the main thing is he knows what the truth is and that it will come out eventually.""
At a news conference to announce the first fight between the two rivals, Fury turned up as Batman, prompting Klitschko to speculate that perhaps he had dressed as the Invisible Man on Monday.
Klitschko, who had threatened to sue Fury's team over alleged contract tampering, also suggested his rival might not even show up on fight night.
""I wouldn't have been surprised if Tyson Fury had turned up and sung a song, so I'm not surprised he hasn't turned up at all,"" said Klitschko, whose defeat by Fury in their first encounter was his first for more than 11 years.
""Even if it doesn't happen in October, I will wait. I've never had such a long break between fights but I've been active, even if I haven't been competing.
""I'm just waiting for my revenge. I just hope he's going to turn up.
""I'm enjoying being the challenger. It has been a great experience for me and it has made me obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back again.""
""I don't feel my age. I'm still capable of performing as an athlete and I've just gained more experience as a fighter. And I'm not concerned about ring rust, because ring rust is in your head.""
Asked how the rematch would be different, Klitschko said: ""The end of the fight is going to be different. I'm not just obsessed about winning this fight, I'm obsessed about winning impressively.""
Since beating Klitschko, Fury has been stripped of his IBF title for refusing to fight the governing body's mandatory challenger.
The IBF belt is now held by Fury's compatriot Anthony Joshua, while American Deontay Wilder is the WBC champion.

200,"BBC Wales understands an advisory panel on creative industries recommends rejecting a request from University of Wales Trinity St David for up to £6m.
The panel is concerned a similar hub already exists in Swansea.
Camarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said the comparison was ""completely inappropriate"".
The panel is chaired by Ron Jones, executive chairman of Tinopolis.
It did not take into account whether the scheme - Yr Egin - would provide any educational or linguistic benefits.
Economy Secretary Ken Skates told the assembly in November it was ""disappointing"" that a ""funding gap"" had appeared since the university first announced the plans in 2014.
Mr Skates has yet to decide on the university's application for between £4m and £6m of public funding.
Directors of the project have previously estimated the new centre for creative industries would be worth £11m a year to the local economy.
Planning permission for the development was granted in October and Kier Group has been appointed as the main contractor.
S4C has previously said its plans to relocate remain unaffected, with 55 jobs moving from Cardiff.  It has agreed to pay £3m in upfront rent for a 20 year lease.
The Welsh Government, the university and S4C have refused to comment.
Carmarthenshire council leader Emlyn Dole said he was extremely disappointed and concerned by the news.
""The comparison between the development in Swansea and Yr Egin is completely inappropriate,"" he said.
""Yr Egin involves the construction of a pioneering creative and digital hub and the development of a creative sector cluster, not just for the Swansea Bay region but for the whole of Wales.""
Plaid Cymru economy spokesman Adam Price claimed ""continued speculation"" over the future of Yr Egin could put the wider £1.3bn ""city deal"" investment plan for the Swansea Bay region at risk.
""This project poses no financial risk whatsoever to the Welsh Government,"" he said of Yr Egin.
""The university has presented a series of funding proposals which would see the taxpayer fully reimbursed if the project doesn't meet the performance criteria agreed.

201,"The holders won eight straight races to triumph 9-8 after being docked two points for cheating in the build-up.
Oracle surged to victory by 44 seconds to retain the Cup they won in 2010.
The Kiwis won four of the first five races, making Oracle modify their boat and call Ainslie from the warm-up crew.
The British sailing legend, 36, a four-time Olympic champion, was drafted in as tactician in place of American veteran John Kostecki and was instrumental in the US outfit's resurgence.
""It's been one of the most amazing comebacks ever, I think, almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege,"" said Ainslie.
Ainslie combined superbly with Oracle's Australian skipper James Spithill and strategist Tom Slingsby, another Australian who won Laser gold at London 2012, to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turnaround in the event's 162-year history.
""To be perfectly honest, we had a mountain to climb,"" Ainslie added. ""We knew we had to sort ourselves out. We had to get the boat going faster. We did that.
""The designers did a great job and we had to start sailing better. We got the momentum going and we started believing in ourselves. When you do that, you can become quite strong. ""
The New Zealanders, with impressive early pace upwind and slicker boat handling, opened up a seven-point lead (six to minus one) as Oracle's crew and equipment changes took effect.

But the US outfit, bankrolled by software billionaire Larry Ellison, were soon up to speed and won 10 of the next 12 races to lift the oldest trophy in international sport, known affectionately as the ""Auld Mug"".
The Kiwis, led by skipper Dean Barker, came within two minutes of glory in race 13 in uncharacteristic light winds before organisers abandoned the race because the 40-minute time limit had elapsed.
In the decider in fresh breeze and sunshine on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand edged a tight start and beat Oracle to the first mark. The Kiwis stayed clear around the second mark but lost the lead to the Americans early on the upwind leg.
After briefly retaking the advantage, the Kiwis then watched as Oracle stormed ahead with remarkable upwind pace and remained clear for a comfortable win.
I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed
""What a race,"" said Spithill, 34, after only the third winner-takes-all final in the event's history. ""It had everything. Man, these guys just showed so much heart.
""On your own, you're nothing, but a team like this can make you look great. We were facing the barrel of a gun at 8-1 and the guys didn't even flinch. Thanks to San Francisco, this is one hell of a day.""
Barker, 41, said: ""It's obviously very hard to fathom. We went out there to give it our absolute best shot. We felt we didn't leave anything on the table. It's very hard to swallow. The gains they've made are phenomenal.
""I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved, but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the Cup back to New Zealand.""
As winners, Oracle will decide on the format, venue and timing of the 35th America's Cup.
The US syndicate first won the Cup in 2010, when they beat holders Alinghi of Switzerland in a one-off match in huge multihulls following protracted legal wrangling.
Ellison and Oracle Team USA boss Russell Coutts, who won the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000 before defecting to Alinghi for 2003, devised a new concept for the 2013 competition.
They opted for revolutionary 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails - and foiling daggerboards later pioneered by the Kiwis - which allowed the boats to reach startling speeds of more than 50mph.
Races were brought inshore to make it more accessible for fans, while cutting-edge TV production with on-screen graphics were introduced to make it more appealing for a new audience of TV viewers.
But the format was controversial and designs untested, with critics fearing for the safety of sailors.
Oracle capsized last year, but it was the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson in a training accident in May that prompted wide-ranging safety measures, including upper wind-speed limits and personal breathing apparatus.
Critics also pointed to spiralling costs, with only three teams - Artemis Racing of Sweden, Emirates Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy - emerging to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series for the right to take on Oracle.
Artemis were unable to mount a meaningful campaign after Simpson's death, as Team New Zealand outclassed Luna Rossa in a one-sided Louis Vuitton Cup final.
But despite Team New Zealand's early stranglehold and a number of races postponed because of unfavourable winds, the America's Cup showed that match-racing in giant catamarans can be hugely exciting and is likely to be the future of the event.",Sir Ben Ainslie's Oracle Team USA sealed one of sport's greatest comebacks when they overhauled an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand in the America's Cup decider in San Francisco.,24274103,"Oracle Team USA, led by skipper Jimmy Spithill and supported by British sailing legend Ben Ainslie, made a stunning comeback in the America's Cup by winning eight straight races after being docked two points for cheating, defeating Team New Zealand 9-8 in the match-racing competition.",1,"Article: {}

And his side looked bereft of drive in the first half where Watford broke quickly and had the finishing touch required in the form of the impressive Ighalo.
Newcastle repeatedly attacked down the wings, but with only four of 40 crosses finding their target, and Papiss Cisse being withdrawn at half-time after missing one decent chance, there was a lack of cutting edge.
Florian Thauvin was the most lively of Newcastle's attackers but it took Janmaat's intervention to get them back into the game, the full-back finishing well after a one-two with Moussa Sissoko.
Boos rang out from some home supporters at the end of the game, and with Chelsea and Manchester City up next, McClaren's task is not about to get any easier.
Ighalo provided the composure in front of goal that Newcastle were lacking as he extended a fabulous scoring run that has made him the most prolific striker in England's top four divisions this year.
However, he was indebted to Watford skipper Troy Deeney, who was tireless in his support play and set up the second goal with a clever ball in behind the Newcastle defence.
Three of Ighalo's four Premier League goals this season have been assisted by his strike partner.
Deeney was not alone in putting in an impressive shift for the visitors.
Once Watford had established their lead they defended superbly as Newcastle threatened from the flanks.
A solid display by the Hornets' back four was aided by convincing performances from defensive midfielders Etienne Capoue and Ben Watson, who made his first Premier League start of the season.
Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores was beaming at full-time, and with good cause after a performance in which his players always seemed to offer support to team-mates, whether in attack or defence.
Newcastle boss Steve McClaren: ""I am trying to change a lot and being here two-and-a-half months, it is very difficult to change things around quickly. I think Newcastle have won three games in the last 25, after a good run in November last year, so there is history there that needs changing and turning around.""

208,"The writer's political play This House has just transferred to London's West End, four years after it premiered at The National Theatre.
Asked what his next project will be, Graham told BBC News: ""I'm working on a TV drama about the referendum campaign.
""I think [Brexit] is going to be the main occupying idea in all writers' heads for the next five or 10 years.""
He added: ""That doesn't mean necessarily writing a dramatic re-enactment of referendum night, I think it just means the new mood we're living in, which is very different, a bit scary, very divisive, very angry, very confused.""
But Graham confirmed that his TV drama will ""specifically tackle what happened"" in the run-up to the EU referendum on 23 June.
The playwright has previously written a short play about Brexit for The Guardian as well as The Vote, a play set in a polling station, which was televised on More4 on the night of the 2015 general election.
His other credits include musical Finding Neverland - for which Graham wrote the script and Gary Barlow the music and lyrics - and Privacy, which made its debut on Broadway earlier this year starring Daniel Radcliffe.
This House deals with the struggles of the Labour government between 1974 and 1979.
It debuted at the National Theatre in 2012, and recently had a run at the Chichester Theatre before transferring to the West End.
The play's director Jeremy Herrin said he was ""delighted"" by the reaction the play has had.
""We haven't really changed much of it, James has kept the same script,"" he told the BBC.
""When we first did it, the audience's obsession was much more about the coalition government in 2010 and how that was working out, and now it's much more about what's happening in the Labour Party.""
He added: ""It's much more about dignity and honour in politics, and whether the procedure can reflect our natures.
""Particularly post-Trump, it feels like that's the big question in the production - is it possible to be a decent human being in a parliamentary framework? So the play starts to answer that question.""
The Guardian's Michael Billington described This House as ""enthralling"" in his five star review of the play after its West End opening.
""Graham brilliantly captures the daily machinations of politics,"" he wrote. ""The whole ensemble contributes to a thrilling play that both relives history and transcends it.""
Writing in The Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish said This House is ""the most intelligent, entertaining and informative political drama of this decade"".
He added: ""This House is a must for those who want to learn more (or be reminded about) the very peculiar workings of Westminster and its often quietly heroic occupants.""

209,"As many as 10 suicide bombers carried out the attacks, which reportedly targeted members of the security forces and allied Shia Muslim militias.
The Islamic State (IS) group, which holds territory in the north and west, said it was behind some of the attacks.
In the deadliest attack, at least 14 people were killed when a bomber blew himself up in a restaurant.
The eatery was popular with members of the Popular Mobilisation, a predominantly Shia militia which has taken a lead role in the fight against IS, the Associated Press reports.
Other attacks hit the southern city of Basra, Baghdad and Mashada, north of the capital.
In recent months government forces backed by Shia militias and US air strikes have regained control over significant parts of Iraq from IS.
On Sunday, the army said it had made progress in an offensive to recapture the western city of Hit, which has been under IS control for the last 18 months.
It said it had taken the northern edge of Hit, about 140km (85 miles) from Baghdad, but was being slowed down by the presence of hundreds of roadside bombs planted by IS.","At least 25 people have been killed and dozens wounded in bomb attacks across Iraq, media reports say.",35958761,"At least 14 people were killed and several locations in Iraq, including the city of Basra and the restaurant popular with Popular Mobilisation forces, were targeted by suicide bombers believed to be affiliated with the Islamic State (IS) group, despite recent government advances in the fight against IS.",0,"Article: {}

210,"Mr Navalny could now be barred from running in the Moscow mayoral election set for September. He also joins a growing list of opponents of President Vladimir Putin who have ended up on the wrong side of the law or in exile, or have met their deaths in suspicious circumstances.
When Mr Putin first became president in 2000, he immediately set about curbing the power of the oligarchs - the group of billionaires who exerted huge influence over Russia's political system and media.
His first victim was media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of NTV, a station that at the time was highly critical of Moscow's war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and was home to the satirical puppet show Kukly, which mercilessly mocked the new president.
When Mr Gusinsky refused to allow the Kremlin to influence NTV's editorial policy he quickly found himself charged with fraud in June 2000, and fled the country shortly afterwards.
Within months, he was joined by his fellow media magnate and political fixer Boris Berezovsky.
Mr Berezovsky is believed to have played a key role in helping Mr Putin into power in 2000. But he quickly fell out of favour with the new regime and sought refuge in the UK.
Mr Berezovsky continued to plot against Mr Putin and to be held up as a bogeyman by the Russian media until he was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March this year. Police have said that there is no evidence of anybody else being involved in his death.
Perhaps most famously Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the now defunct oil company, Yukos, was targeted when (like Mr Navalny) he accused Mr Putin and his associates of conniving in massive corruption.
He has subsequently been convicted in two trials of tax evasion and fraud. Following his second trial in 2010, Amnesty International recognised Mr Khodorkovsky and his co-defendant, Platon Lebedev, as ""prisoners of conscience"".
Mr Khodorkovsky is due for release in 2014, but there are signs that he could face further charges.
Political opposition to Mr Putin is becoming an increasingly risky business, with numerous activists facing charges or in jail.
Two members of feminist band Pussy Riot are serving two-year prison sentences for ""hooliganism motivated by religious hatred"" after performing an ""anti-Putin punk prayer"" in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February 2012. A third member of the band had her sentence suspended on appeal.
Meanwhile, criminal charges of affray, incitement to violence and assaulting police officers are pending against more than 20 activists involved in disturbances at a demonstration in Moscow on the eve of Mr Putin's inauguration as president for a third term in May 2012.
Sergei Udaltsov, a left-wing leader of the protest movement, is under house arrest after being charged with incitement to mass disorder on the basis of video evidence shown on Russian TV. If found guilty, Mr Udaltsov (like Mr Navalny) could face a substantial prison sentence.
Some members of the Russian opposition, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, continue to defy Mr Putin despite regular harassment and detention for public order offences.
Like Mr Navalny, Mr Nemtsov is a member of the opposition's alternative parliament, the Coordination Council. He is also co-author of a report accusing Mr Putin of leading Russia to ruin.
Another member of the Coordination Council, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, has joined the growing list of Russia's political emigres.
But, as the fate of former FSB (Federal Security Service) officer Alexander Litvinenko showed, even exile carries risks for Mr Putin's opponents.
Mr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive polonium.
It is not just oligarchs and politicians who have to fear Putin's disfavour. Journalists and TV presenters, too, have to be wary of offending the Kremlin.
Ksenia Sobchak, whose father Anatoly was Mr Putin's political mentor, was a familiar face on light entertainment shows on Russia TV until she joined the protest movement following the disputed parliamentary election in 2011.
Since then, her lucrative contracts on mainstream TV have dried up and her appearances have been confined to the niche liberal channel Dozhd - a refuge for several dissident journalists.
Mr Putin makes little secret of his hostility to journalists who challenge his authority.
Shortly after the murder in 2006 of Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter with opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and fierce critic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya, Mr Putin dismissed her political influence as ""negligible"".
Ms Politkovskaya is one of five Novaya Gazeta journalists who have been murdered or died in suspicious circumstances since 2000.

213,"They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.
Police officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was ""obviously not well"".
Lanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him.
""Camera shy"" was the comment by his entry.
Unlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police.
Adam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child.
He went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.
His aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was ""definitely the challenge to the family in that house"".
""Every family has one. I have one. They have one. â€¦ But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,"" she said.
Intelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him.
Richard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had ""some disabilities"".
He was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to ""take flight"", Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem.
""You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.""
Mr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment.
""If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,"" he said.
An inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts.
They stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however.
Olivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was ""very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody"".
""Now looking back, it's kind of like 'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,"" she said.
A former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys.
""You know the trouble kids, and you figure, 'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,"" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper.
Marsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it.
The parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried.
His mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home.
Friends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was ""a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out.""
Contrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
She was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car.
Adam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010.
In a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: ""No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.

Like so many of you, we are saddened and struggling to make sense of what has transpired.""","Former classmates of Adam Lanza, 20, the man identified as the gunman in the Sandy Hook School killings, do not remember much about him.",20738732,"Adam Lanza, the gunman responsible for the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, was described by former classmates and teachers as a shy and nervous boy who kept a low profile and had a limited online presence, leading some to speculate that he may have had a personality or developmental disorder.",0,"Article: {}

214,"Writing in her autobiography, she claimed the director ""threw himself"" on top of her in the back of his limousine and tried to kiss her.
The actress described the encounter as ""an awful, awful moment"".
Hedren added that she didn't tell anyone because ""sexual harassment and stalking were terms that didn't exist"" in the early 1960s.
She continued: ""Besides, he was Alfred Hitchcock, one of Universal's superstars, and I was just a lucky little blonde model he'd rescued from relative obscurity. Which one of us was more valuable to the studio, him or me?""
Hedren appeared in The Birds in 1963 and the following year starred in Marnie - both of which were directed by Hitchcock.
The actress, now 86, made the claims in her autobiography Tippi: A Memoir, which is published in November.
She has spoken in the past about the director's alleged treatment of her, but has gone into more detail in the memoir.
Hedren described a later encounter in Hitchcock's office where the director ""suddenly grabbed"" her and ""put his hands"" on her.
She wrote: ""It was sexual, it was perverse, and it was ugly, and I couldn't have been more shocked and more repulsed.
""The harder I fought him, the more aggressive he became. Then he started adding threats, as if he could do anything to me that was worse than what he was trying to do at that moment.""
After refusing his demands, Hedren said Hitchcock ""looked directly into my eyes, his face red with rage, and promised, 'I'll ruin your career.'""
The actress said Hitchcock then made her life difficult, refusing to submit her work for the Oscar nominations or let her take on other acting roles while he still had her under contract.
Hedren, whose daughter Melanie Griffith is also an actress, said: ""I've made it my mission ever since to see to it that while Hitchcock may have ruined my career, I never gave him the power to ruin my life.""
She went on to say that, despite his treatment of her, she felt ""a wave of sadness"" when he died in 1980.
""It surprised everyone that I went to Hitchcock's funeral,"" she wrote, adding: ""As far as I was concerned, there was no unfinished business between us, nothing more that needed to be said.
""I'd already healed and moved on by the time Hitchcock died, far past anything I'd ever imagined for myself. So in the end, I was there to say, 'Goodbye, and thank you, Hitch.'""

215,"The retailer has been under fire over zero hours contracts and disclosure that staff at a warehouse were paid less than the minimum wage.
Independent shareholders had called for changes to the way the company was run.
Sources told the BBC that Mr Forsey was ""not coerced"", and that Mr Ashley is a permanent replacement, not temporary.
The billionaire businessman has given up his role as executive deputy chairman.
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said sources told him that the shake-up was not part of a plan to take Sports Direct private.
There has been speculation that, following months of criticism of the company, Mr Ashley wanted to remove Sports Direct from the stock market.
Mr Ashley, who owns more than 50% of the company, said in a statement: ""I feel like I have lost my right arm, but I do hope to have the opportunity to work with Dave again in the future.""
Mr Forsey has worked for the retailer for 32 years after starting as a part-time worker when he was 18.
Earlier this year he agreed to forgo a £3.7m share award in recognition of the problems at the company.
Mr Forsey said: ""I have given my entire working life to the company and in return the company has given me amazing opportunities and experiences.""
Sports Direct's board made two other changes, promoting Karen Byers to the role of global head of operations, and Sean Nevitt to the role of global head of commercial.
Amid criticism over Sports Direct's working practices and bad publicity, there had been calls by shareholders for the removal of chairman Keith Hellawell.
The company, which has around 450 retail outlets, came under the spotlight after an investigation uncovered that staff were kept on site at its giant Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire after their shifts for body searches.
These took so long that their pay effectively dipped below the minimum wage.
Mr Ashley, Sports Direct's billionaire founder, was called to answer questions from MPs, who compared working practices at the warehouse with ""that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern High Street retailer"".
In the wake of that, the sportswear chain's lawyers produced a critical report of its working conditions.
The company was criticised for its use of zero hours contracts. It says it will offer workers who want them guaranteed hours. It also said it would put a worker on the board.
That report also criticised Mr Forsey for failing to inform the Sports Direct board about some of the issues at Shirebrook.
But calls for an independent review continued and earlier this week, Sports Direct said it would authorise such a study of working practices and corporate governance, following concerns raised by shareholders.
Mr Ashley denied knowing much about the way Shirebrook operated, telling the BBC: ""You'd be surprised how little I knew of what was going on.""
Like so many in the company's hierarchy, Karen Byers, Sports Direct's new global head of operations met founder Mike Ashley informally and has known him a very long time.
She's been with the company for more than 20 years and it is said she got the job after trying to sell Mike Ashley a pair of jeans. Despite being head of retail at a publicly-listed retail giant with 30,000 employees for much at that time, she's very low profile indeed.
Earlier this year Mike Ashley himself singled her out in a rare interview he gave to the Times newspaper: ""Karen Byers runs Sports Direct. She runs the retail, all the money comes out the retail, [the warehouse workers and store managers] are her army. She is the person who sets the rules. Not me.""
One investment analyst firm said she was well regarded inside the company and out. The same firm though said she was not known for her ""flowery or evasive approach"". Just like her boss.
Paul Blomfield, a member of the Business Innovation and Skills committee which grilled Mike Ashley in June, is not convinced by the changes: ""What our committee wanted to happen was for the company to seriously address what was, not just problems around the edges, but systemic labour exploitation in the workplace. And whether Mr Ashley is the person to do that - given the evidence he gave to our committee - is yet to be seen.""
Mike Fox, from shareholder Royal London Asset Management, wasn't impressed with Friday's board changes either: ""The installation of Mike Ashley as chief executive, consolidating his influence at the top of the business, is unlikely to reassure anyone.""
He said the way the company was run had long been a problem and that Sports Direct still needed a new chairman before it could rebuild trust with investors.
Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder pressure group, Manifest, told BBC Radio 5 live the move added another corporate governance problem: ""Are we going to see [Mike Ashley] step down from his other job as deputy chairman?
""Had Mike Ashley listened to shareholders four or five years ago, we might not be in the situation we're in at the moment.""
She said the company's actions were not just damaging to shareholders but ""undermined the general public's perception of capitalism - full stop"".
Nevertheless, market reaction suggests most investors were pleased that Mike Ashley would have a more direct role in the company and the shares were up about 5% in morning trade.
Mr Ashley's brash style is unorthodox for the founder and executive of a leading UK company. The owner of Newcastle United football club was photographed with a wad of cash when he took shareholders and journalists on a tour of the Shirebrook site after the shareholders' meeting.
He also revealed that he travels to work by helicopter. The company employs Mike Ashley's daughter's boyfriend to run its property arm.
Financially, the company is not in a good place.
The company's shares have fallen by 50% this year, and earlier this month Sports Direct warned that that profits next year would be down on this year.","The founder and majority owner of Sports Direct, Mike Ashley, has stepped in as chief executive after the surprise resignation of Dave Forsey.",37448915,"Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley has taken on a more direct role as chief executive of the company, replacing executive deputy chairman Dave Forsey, amid ongoing criticism of the company's working practices and corporate governance, with changes also including the promotion of Karen Byers to global head of operations and Sean Nevitt to global head of commercial, despite calls from shareholders for an independent review and concerns over zero hours contracts and disclosure of staff being paid less than the minimum wage at a company warehouse.",0,"Article: {}

In November, the club owed repayments on a £10.25m loan to the local borough council, while they faced a winding-up petition from HM Revenue & Customs and the club's bank account was frozen.

219,"Michael Gunn, a retired chartered accountant, wants to spend some of it on a new roof for the church hall.
But in defiance of experts, he also wants to use the money for a transatlantic cruise.
The changes take effect on Bank Holiday Monday, so Mr Gunn will receive the payment on Tuesday morning.
""I had no idea they'd whisk me into the limelight, and say I am the first,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't mind that.""
Initially he wants to donate cash to the fund for the church hall roof - in the village of Newton Poppleford - after it burnt down in a fire.
But later in the year he is planning to take his wife across the Atlantic on board the Queen Mary Two.
Mr Gunn was not prepared to say how much he would be taking out of his pension pot, but he has taken care to heed warnings about tax bills.
""What I like about this is that you are totally in charge of how much tax you are exposed to - to stay within a lower tax band,"" he said.
Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said thousands of people withdrawing money might find themselves paying much more tax than they needed to.
Other experts have pointed out that, in any case, people taking out cash will have to pay what is called ""emergency tax"".
Unless individuals can show a P45 tax form, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will treat any payments as if they are a new monthly salary.
In other words, they will charge tax on the basis that the new income is repeated every month for a year.
So anyone cashing in a pension of Â£18,000 - assuming nothing is taken tax-free- would be charged an immediate tax bill of Â£6,592.
Those in that position will have to reclaim the tax using forms P50 or P53.
However HMRC has promised they will get the money back within a month.
Meanwhile, hundreds of staff from Citizens Advice - and Citizens Advice Scotland - are preparing to offer free face-to-face interviews with anyone who needs help, from Tuesday.
Those aged 55 or over can go to one of 500 offices in England and Wales, or 90 in Scotland. Those living in very remote areas of Scotland can arrange home visits.
But customers will only receive ""guidance"", not advice.
""What we don't do is provide any details of which companies people can go to for pensions - or which particular products,"" said Richard Chilton, one of those who will be conducting the interviews.
""But we provide guidance on what the options are,"" he said.
Anyone wanting to book an interview, or receive telephone guidance, should call the Pension Wise service, on 030 0330 1001.

223,"Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness.
He was surrounded by friends and family at a meal shortly before his death at the clinic, which aids accompanied suicide.
His wife Elaine and three daughters said they respected his decision.
The family said in a statement: ""Whilst we are now in a state of all-consuming grief and miss Jeffrey very much, we also recognise that he is now at peace and away from the fear which surrounded him in the last few weeks of his life.
""Jeffrey ended his life with dignity and control which was his overwhelming desire.""
In an interview with the Blackpool Gazette last week, Mr Spector said: ""If I am paralysed and can't speak, send me to the spirit world.""
He reportedly said the condition was affecting his nervous system.
Friend Linda Earle, who had known him for 20 years, said: ""He's fought it every step of the way. I've never known a man try so hard.
""I don't blame him for a minute....it's no one else's decision but his own.""
Journalist David Graham told BBC Radio Lancashire he had spoken to Mr Spector at his hotel near the clinic in Zurich.
Mr Graham said Mr Spector, a director of an advertising agency, had had a series of consultations with leading surgeons across the UK.
""He had one operation which failed and I think that spurred him on the Dignitas route,"" said Mr Graham.
In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt.
Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said he would attempt to reintroduce a bill that would allow assisted dying in the UK.
He said it was ""completely wrong"" that terminally ill people did not have the option to end their life.
""Whatever your take on the subject, it should be debated,"" Lord Falconer told the BBC.
Last year the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, clarified assisted suicide guidelines, making the prosecution of health professionals less likely.
However, in April, disability rights campaigners who said assisted suicide policy was too ""liberal"" won permission to bring a legal challenge to her policy.
Rob George, president of the Association for Palliative Medicine, said he was concerned about any possible law change.
He said: ""This is a dangerous distraction from providing decent health care, and actually it's the dying that we need to look after.
""Our job is to look after people as they die... not in order that they die.""
However, the daughter of a woman who died at Dignitas last year said she wanted the law to change so that terminally ill people could end their life at home.
Jayne Bramwell's daughter Lindsay said that it would help to ""ease the path for everyone involved and make what is a horrendous time a bit easier"".
She said it was ""enormously distressing"" for her mother to have to travel to Switzerland in a wheelchair.
""She just wanted to be at home and have all her family with her..."" she said.
In 2008, a paralysed rugby player from Worcester died at Dignitas.
Daniel James, 23, had a collapsed spine following an accident during training with Nuneaton Rugby Club. The Director of Public Prosecutions said prosecutions in the case would not be in the public interest.
Dignitas, which said it aided ""accompanied suicide"", often described as assisted suicide, has not commented specifically on the Jeffrey Spector case.
The charity, founded in 1998, said: ""The main work of Dignitas is not assistance in dying but in fact suicide preventive work, above all suicide-attempt-prevention work in a broad sense.""",A British father-of-three who feared he would be paralysed by an inoperable tumour has died at the Dignitas centre in Switzerland.,32881161,"Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died at a clinic in Zurich, Switzerland, after a six-year illness, surrounded by friends and family, with his wife and daughters respecting his decision to end his life with dignity and control, despite the controversy surrounding assisted suicide in the UK.",0,"Article: {}

226,"The IXV resembles a smaller, robotically controlled version of the US space shuttle, and could provide Europe with a re-useable orbital transportation system of its own
It blasted off on a Vega rocket from South America just after 13:40 GMT.
The test data could also inform future Mars landing technologies.
The demonstrator flew east around the globe, before coming down in the water west of the Galapagos Islands at about 15:20 GMT.
The wedge-shaped IXV (Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle) was designed to gather information on how space objects fall back to Earth.
Commenting on the flight, Esa director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain said: ""It couldn't have gone better.
""But the mission itself is not over because now it is necessary to analyse all the data gathered during the flight.""
At the time the craft re-entered the atmosphere, it was moving at 7.5km/s. As it pushed against the air, the temperatures on its leading surfaces would have soared to 1,700C.
Flaps and thrusters controlled the trajectory, ensuring the IXV came down close to a recovery ship.
A parachute system deployed in the very late stages of the flight and put the two-tonne vehicle gently in the ocean. Floatation balloons came out to stop it from sinking.
Europe's expertise on re-entry technologies is more limited than, say, the US's or Russia's - something it wants to change with the help of the IXV.
Esa's project manager Giorgio Tumino told BBC News: ""Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit.
""So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - we need to master this third leg as well as other spacefaring nations.""
Esa has already approved a follow-on spacecraft, called Pride, which looks very similar in design to the X-37B, a robotic craft operated by the American military.
No-one is quite sure what missions are flown by the X-37B, but they are likely to include the early testing of new technologies for future satellites.
This could be a role also for Europe's Pride vehicle. In-orbit servicing of satellites is a capability often discussed in this context as well.
Esa nations will meet shortly to define these roles.
""We need still to agree with all the member states all the different types of operations in orbit. But whatever the payload, it will always be in the perimeter space of civilian applications,"" stresses Mr Tumino.","A prototype for a versatile mini-spaceplane has successfully completed its first test flight, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean.",31421200,"The European Space Agency (Esa) successfully tested its Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV) spacecraft, which is designed to gather data on how space objects fall back to Earth and could provide Europe with a reusable orbital transportation system, by launching it on a Vega rocket from South America and recovering it in the ocean after a flight that included re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere.",0,"Article: {}

229,"""There's a lot going on right now,""  the singer tells us. And she's not wrong.
The follow-up to her Mercury Prize-nominated debut, 2013's Sing To The Moon, is imminent. Second album The Dreaming Room is due in June and her newest track Phenomenal Woman has just debuted as Annie Mac's hottest record on BBC Radio 1.
""And then we have probably the most important live moment on TV in this country today,"" she adds.
""It's all potentially extremely exciting - and that just means that I'm naturally terrified.""
The singer's struggles with stage fright and anxiety are well-documented and live TV is a particular fear.
Describing the concept as ""just hellish"", she tells us: ""I'd rather die. That's how I feel sometimes - I think, 'if I dropped dead I wouldn't have to do it!'.""
So, it's perhaps surprising that the singer let us tag along as she kicked off the new series of Later... with Jools Holland. But it seems BBC Two's esteemed music show has a special place in her heart.
""In the musician's world, you say 'Jools Holland' and all of a sudden you've got massive respect - it's like saying you got Glastonbury.""
Her third time on Later... she calls respected musician and presenter Holland a ""genuine champion"".
""He called me this afternoon just to say that he'd been listening to my new record and he wanted to tell me specifically what song and what parts and why.
""I tell you, in the TV world, it's not the kind of place where there's room for those kind of genuine interactions, just because there's so much pressure on everyone. It's very special.""
Here the diary of Laura's day.
Tour manager Paul picks us up in sunny east London. Laura's assistant Mariama is laden with popcorn and snacks as we pile into the silver Mercedes van bound for the studios in Kent. The singer takes some me-time behind her shades, safe in the knowledge it's going to be a long day.
""I'm such a weird person to be around before anything big,"" she admits.
""I can't normally talk, so my team tend to just leave me to it, but I'll pick up.
""Right now I want to be jumping up, but you don't want to celebrate before the main event, so I'm just trying to be as relaxed as I can.""
We arrive to the sounds of Kano and his brass section sound-checking. He's on the bill along with Paul Simon, The Coral, Jason Isbell and Lake Street Dive.
Laura has the honour of opening and closing both the live and pre-recorded shows, something she says she's ""glad you only find out on the day"".
""I'm doing Phenomenal Woman, Kiss My Feet - which the Jools team requested - and Overcome, the first single, which featured Nile Rogers.
""I wanted to explode back onto the scene with something that was captivating in a much rawer and darker way. That's why there's dance and so much movement this time around, and why it's such a visual album.""
Backstage the band are split across two dressing rooms - one for the boys and one for the girls, where we're quickly made welcome as they debate which of the many black items of clothing they've brought will get worn.
""There's nine of us - it's huge by pop terms, but I refused to compromise,"" says Laura.
""With Sing To The Moon, six of us were trying to sound like an orchestra and a choir. It was a stress.
""My sister Dionne went from violin to guitar - literally learnt the guitar [and] is killing it - my brother's playing cello. It feels much more like a band than me trying to do the solo artist thing. We feel like a really solid family.""
Still in her fur-lined boots and denim dress from the journey, Laura and the band head to the camera rehearsal. Jools arrives and gives Laura a hug, waving hello to the production team. Giant white cue cards are being written to help him introduce the acts.
Running through each of their tracks twice, Laura sports her new keytar in place of her trademark piano.
""Lady Mariama was up until 4am trying to make my keytar white. I mean what the hell is that about?"" she laughs.
""Initially it was a joke idea, I was just messing about jamming with it, but it made so much sense. I'm not stuck behind anything in a static way anymore, I can move and I can see people. If I want to turn and feel the band I can do that. We have such a good time now.""
Time for some nourishment. The team (""there's like millions of them... making it work"") are handed pocket money for the canteen, while Laura retreats to her dressing room. As well as make-up, wardrobe and calming those nerves, she also has a TV interview to fit in.
""I used to not eat, I couldn't eat. But I've learned to, so you don't drop off after one song. I have meatballs and sweet potato fries. And a balance of water and red wine.""
""[Designer] Alex Noble has done a lot of my clothes recently,"" says Laura. ""He is just on another planet. He text me yesterday and I was just weeping emojis because the clothes are just... I mean you'll see with the outfit tonight.
""I made a visual essay for the album, this massive book [filled with] images, as stimulus for new music but also to help anybody I might be collaborating with. Stylists or people in the label, anyone could take the book and go 'oh yeah, I'm listening and I'm looking'.
""It means I get to talk less. That's probably surprising to some people because I do love to natter! But it helps.""
Minutes before show time, Laura's designer and assistant are still huddled together in one of the dressing rooms with a needle and thread and the singer's fabulous outfit in their hands.
She's set to do an interview at Jools's famous piano, but the purple corset she'll be wearing (with matching super-flared trousers) will be too tight to sit down in. Cue furious unpicking and re-stitching. Eventually it's decided she'll do the interview standing up. Problem solved.
With the audience in place and schooled on how to cheer and clap in the correct manner, Laura's up first - opening the pre-recorded show with Maya Angelou-inspired anthem Phenomenal Woman.
""If you're first out of the blocks - you're the thing in the room that makes the first sound. I've been second and third before and everybody breathes when the sound's been made,"" says Laura.
There's mild panic when the lighting desk freezes after The Coral perform, but after a few minutes of confusion they're rolling again.
Later, a respectful hush descends as Paul Simon performs Sounds Of Silence in the centre of the studio.
""He made me cry so much,"" says Laura. ""I kept thinking, 'why didn't I bring Mum to this gig?'. She was raised on Simon and Garfunkel.
""I ended up thinking about my whole life, my creative life... what is this all about? Here I am literally stood in front of Mr Paul Simon.""
With all the stars limbered up (and the shortest of toilet breaks), the second show goes live on BBC Two.
""It's an amazing feeling because you know that it's happening now and everybody's tuned in, but at the same time - the fear and the dread. You can't correct anything, so whatever comes out is it. ""
Laura ends the live show on a high with Phenomenal Woman.
""That for me was surprisingly wonderful, because live television literally - there's nothing that I'm more terrified of! And the live performance was better than the pre-record - what?!""
It's all over. The audience files out and the set's dismantled as artists and their teams pack up their gear and rush to congratulate each other.
US outfit Lake Street Dive collar Laura for a picture, while she and sister Dionne seek out Kano for a snap (""Because he's fine. And obviously amazing"").
""I always forget how emotionally exhausting it is,"" says Laura.
""The amount I invest into any performance is always bucket loads of sweat or tension that doesn't get released until I'm in that moment.
""That's the uniqueness of a show like Jools's - you are getting that concentrated performance.""
So what now?
""Everybody laughs at me because I literally make a beeline for my bed after. I'll probably eat again later because I always get a major appetite, which is why I have this thing [grabs belly area] that will never go away.
""But yeah, I just conk out. If I think about stuff I'll go nuts, because you've just put something out.
""I mean I haven't had a child, but I imagine - like when you have a baby - it's out there. I can't push it back in!""

230,"Salva Kiir issued a decree dismissing all ministers and deputy ministers, as well as Vice-President Riek Machar.
No clear reason was given for the sackings, but analysts say Mr Kiir and Mr Machar have been embroiled in a power struggle for months.
South Sudan has suffered from chronic economic problems since it split from Sudan in 2011.
There was tight security outside ministry buildings on Wednesday, while radio broadcasts urged people to remain calm, the AFP news agency reports.
Its stability has been hampered by lingering rows over territory and oil with its northern neighbour.
Recently some of Mr Kiir's colleagues have hinted at discontent with his leadership.
Local reports say Mr Kiir is battling to maintain control of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), the former rebel group that now runs the country.
Mr Machar, who had been stripped of some of his powers in April, had hinted that he may stand against Mr Kiir for leadership of the SPLM before the next presidential election in 2015.
By Nyambura WambuguBBC News, Juba
Dissolving the cabinet in South Sudan hints at a wider attempt by the president to restructure not only the government but power and access to power in the country.
There have been reports in recent weeks of strained relations within the governing SPLM and the relationship between the president and his deputy are said to be at an all-time low.
Although the cabinet restructuring has been a long time coming, its timing is curious and raises suspicions that the president could be using his executive powers to stamp out dissent in the party and disagreement within his government.
Whether the sacking of the entire cabinet will succeed in calming the disquiet within South Sudan's political circles remains to be seen -there is also a real fear that this might further divide the country along ethnic lines.
The BBC's Nyambura Wambugu in the capital, Juba, says there is a real fear that the sacking could further divide the country along ethnic lines.
Mr Kiir is from the Dinka community, which is the largest in South Sudan, while Mr Machar is from the second-largest group, the Nuer, some of whom have complained about Dinka domination.
Under-secretaries have been put in charge of the departments and the government insists it can function smoothly until new ministers are appointed.
Barnaba Marial Benjamin, who had been information minister until Tuesday, characterised the sackings as a ""major reshuffle"" and said it was part of Mr Kiir's constitutional mandate.
""Some of these people will come back and some will not,"" Mr Benjamin AFP.
Among the other leaders to be dismissed was Pagan Amum, the top negotiator in peace talks with Sudan.
He was removed from his post as SPLM secretary general and the decree said he would be investigated for mismanaging the party.
Last month Mr Kiir sacked two other senior ministers embroiled in a multi-million dollar financial scandal, a decision reportedly criticised by Mr Amum.
It was unclear whether Tuesday's decree had any link to the scandal.
South Sudanese journalist Nhial Bol said Mr Kiir had probably acted to end the paralysis in his government.
""Things have not been moving in the government because of this internal fighting over who is going to control the SPLM,"" Mr Bol told Reuters news agency.
South Sudan is rich in oil, but is one of Africa's least developed countries, with few paved roads and poor health and educational facilities.
It gained independence from Sudan in July 2011 after a decades-long civil war.
However, the oil refineries are on Sudanese territory, so the South relies on its northern neighbour to get its product on to the market.","South Sudan's president has sacked his entire cabinet, in an apparent power struggle with other senior leaders.",23428557,"South Sudanese President Salva Kiir issued a decree dismissing all ministers and deputy ministers, including Vice-President Riek Machar, in a move that analysts say is part of a wider power struggle within the government, which has been embroiled in a chronic economic crisis since its independence from Sudan in 2011.",0,"Article: {}

The government wants private enterprise, which currently makes up 40% of the market, to fill the gap left behind by the FSS.
But some experts are concerned that an over-emphasis on profits could threaten the quality of science.
The FSS analyses evidence from crime scenes in England and Wales, but has been losing about £2m a month.
In a written submission to the inquiry, Steve Allen, the managing director of LGC Forensics, commented: ""The closure of the FSS will not damage the prospects for forensic science in the UK so long as its wind-down is properly implemented and is used by the government as an opportunity to support a properly regulated market of a sufficient size to enable competition between dedicated market participants.""
The Home Office has tasked the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) with managing the gradual wind down of the FSS.
Written evidence from David Hartshorne and Roger Derbyshire, directors at commercial provider Cellmark, said there would be no negative impacts on the quality or impartiality of forensic evidence.
""Forensic scientists in the private sector have exactly the same motivation to support the criminal justice system and the victims of crime as those in the public sector,"" they said.
""[Private sector scientists'] ethics and impartiality are independent of the organisation for whom they work; and ultimately, when they stand in the witness box to provide evidence, they are representing themselves rather than the company that employs them.""
In a written response to parliamentary questions on 1 February, Crime Reduction Minister James Brokenshire said advice from ACPO, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and others suggested that the UK forensics market would contract from £170 million in 2009 towards about £110 million by 2015.
In addition, police forces have been bringing forensic work in-house, in order to make cost savings. And commentators say this could pose an impediment to the future expansion of the private forensics market.
Some forensic scientists have expressed dismay at the FSS's closure, voicing concerns about the quality of science, the retention of expertise and the future of forensic research and development (R&D) once the service is closed down.
In a letter to New Scientist magazine in January, Professor Alec Jeffreys, who pioneered the technique of genetic fingerprinting at the University of Leicester, said the decision to close the FSS could not be in the interests of justice.
""Who will provide the expertise for complex and interdisciplinary investigations, and who will develop and refine new technologies? The private sector is most unlikely to fill this void,"" he wrote.
As reported by BBC News last month, Peter Gill, professor of forensic genetics at the University of Oslo, said there was a mismatch between the government's aim to commercialise forensic science and the requirement of courts for openness.
He added that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details were kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues.
Mr Brokenshire has said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. This course is questioned by Prospect union, which represents scientists and engineers, in their evidence to the inquiry.
""Currently the forensic science regulator sits in the Home Office, but... Prospect understands that there are very limited powers and no statutory influence,"" the union wrote.
It added: ""Additional regulatory powers will be needed to ensure that there is a level playing field between police forces and private contractors. It will also be essential to ensure that forensic science practitioners have recognisable and respected qualifications and a professional code of ethics.""
Professor Allan Jamieson, director of the Forensic Institute in Glasgow, which is a commercial supplier of forensic services, said there was ""no reason to expect that, if properly managed, this market cannot deliver the required service at a fair price"".
But he highlighted the need for the involvement of the wider scientific community in UK forensic science to prevent it from becoming isolated.
""It cannot be known whether any provider has met the scientific standard if there is no scientific research to measure the standard against,"" he wrote in his submission.
""Perhaps properly funding this essential research is the obvious, logical, and necessary step to prevent the feared decline of standards in forensic science.""
The FSS is headquartered in Birmingham, with a number of laboratories around England and Wales; it has already closed laboratories at Chepstow and central Birmingham to help bring costs under control. The service previously employed about 1,600 staff.

235,"One year on, the first handball matches since the Olympic Games have taken place inside the venue - reborn as a sports centre for the community - and  on its hallowed London 2012 floor tiles. Handball will be a regular feature here.
If you missed it at London 2012, handball is played on an indoor court between two teams of seven players. To simplify things greatly, you use your hands to throw the ball into the opposing team's goal.
For handball's dedicated British fans, getting back in the Box at the Olympic Park has been a rare thrill.
""We're in our Wembley,"" says Paul Stewart, who plays for Ruislip Eagles and took part in one of Sunday's inaugural games.
""This is the pinnacle. You don't get to play in the biggest sports stadiums in football unless you're a pro. Every so often I look up from what looks like a gym floor and see these banks of seats, and remember - I'm in the Copper Box! Wow!
""I can see the seat I sat in at the Olympics.""
Stewart was not a handball player this time 12 months ago, but he traded some water polo tickets with friends for the chance to see the sport and a love affair was born.
""We saw a double header in the group stage, Croatia-Spain and France-Sweden. The wow factor was there, watching these amazing goalkeepers.
""I went to my first session at the end of August last year, intending to be a goalkeeper, and the buzz was amazing.
""I remember getting home that evening and thinking: 'That was so much better than I'd imagined.' I was thinking I'd come home bruised or not even bruised because I hadn't touched the ball... but it was so much fun.""
For Dani Sposi, setting foot inside the Copper Box is bittersweet. A former member of the British handball team, she narrowly missed out on selection for London 2012.
""During preparations for the Games we used to go there once a month,"" she remembers. ""When I got there, I remembered the smell, all those times we used to train there.
""Being there as a player after the Olympics was a bit emotional, because I wasn't selected and it was very hard to go through all that disappointment.
""I had my six-year-old son, Matteo, with me. He said: 'Mum, why didn't you play at the Olympics?' I said: 'Well, the coach made a different decision, so mummy didn't play.'
Dani Sposi: ""We had loads of people coming into the Copper Box on Sunday and asking about handball. We had another area in the arena where we could explain what handball is all about and let them shoot at goal.
""Sometimes people don't realise how hard handball is. Even the parents are like 'oh, I'll do it' - and then 'oh, this is hard!' You have to find the right co-ordination with the three steps and the bounce.""
Paul Stewart: ""We had easily hundreds, probably a couple of thousand people all told. There were points when it was massively busy, queues of parents with children all holding a ball waiting to have a go. It was superb.
""At league level, for the next year or so, it's going to be massive. If we get the right publicity, if people can see the sport and know it's still carrying on in the Olympic venue, that might drag them in across the country.""
""He has been with me the whole journey, since he was eight months old - all the training sessions, travelling around. It was very good for him to be there, to go inside the Olympic arena. Even during training, I never had the chance to bring him in.""
Sposi's dream of an Olympic appearance for Great Britain has ended, but other players in the Box still aspire to fly the British flag - despite a critical shortage of funding leaving GB's elite teams in limbo.
""Playing in the Olympic venue was a proud moment,"" says Gil Lewis, another who only started playing after London 2012.
Lewis already has two university team-mates who have been selected for the England Under-20 squad within a year of taking up the sport; he himself was chosen to play for the British universities team, but their trip to a tournament in the Netherlands fell apart when the travel proved too expensive.
A shortage of cash is a feature of life as a handball player in Britain, but Lewis is determined not to let it dampen his enthusiasm.
""This year I've been invited to move up to the first team; I was in shock when I was first asked. They've asked if I want to go to the Challenge Cup, playing in Bulgaria, and that would be an amazing experience,"" he says.
""That all has to be funded through ourselves and it's a lot of personal expense to play. But an opportunity to play in a European competition? You don't want to miss out because you didn't save up enough.""
British teams competed at London 2012 by virtue of being the Olympic hosts. In future, they will have to qualify for the Games on merit, which is a big ask of a fledgling sport, but Lewis is determined to take the sport as far as he can.
""If a GB team is still around in the next few years, to be able to play for them would be fantastic,"" he says. ""If you'd told me a year ago, I'd never have imagined I'd be anywhere close to being able to represent my country.
""There will be a few years before I'm near that standard and with all the work being done at grassroots, by that time hopefully the standard will have improved enough to warrant some kind of funding - to at least put some form of team out.""
Stewart adds: ""Outside the obvious problem with elite funding, we're in a very strong position to drive growth at youth level.
""At Ruislip, we're working hard to get together a full youth structure, plus I'm talking to local schools and colleges and we've got a tie-in with Brunel University.
""If we can get people into the sport, who knows what we can achieve?""","Last summer, the Copper Box played host to surprise smash-hit handball, a sport which engrossed unsuspecting British audiences.",23487664,"One year after the Olympic Games, handball matches are being held again inside the Copper Box stadium in London, which has been reborn as a community sports center, with dedicated British fans and new players alike enjoying the sport and hoping to represent Great Britain in future international competitions despite a lack of funding.",0,"Article: {}

Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption.

246,"It is the joint-most corrupt country in the world with Somalia, according to Transparency International, and the same family has ruled since 1948.
So why is it holding elections? And how reliable are they?
Local elections have been held in North Korea since 1999 - let's not forget that the country's full name is, technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
Sunday's elections are to decide provincial governors, mayors and local assemblies in the country of almost 25m people.
The number of seats is determined by each district's population.
In the second provincial elections in 2003, one report said 26,650 ""officials, workers, peasants and intellectuals"" were elected.
The choice is limited - there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district, and while the selection of candidates is made by the governing coalition, they are closely overseen by Kim Jong-un's Workers' Party.
Ahead of last year's elections to name deputies for the country's assembly, The Economist reported that voting did not take place in secret, and any dissenting votes must be placed in a separate ballot box.
Abstaining or voting no are considered acts of treason.
In the last local election, in 2011, there was a turnout of 99.7%, with the state news agency saying those unable to vote were abroad or on the high seas.
Having such a high reported turnout has its advantages for the state, observers say, in that it acts as an informal census.
""The government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it"", one North Korean defector told the NK News website.
""It is often during election that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed.""

Sunday's elections do not decide the leadership of the country.

The latest video about the home, by Kankan News, features Little Dragon, a sparky 10-year-old German Shepherd, and has been viewed more than 14.7 million times on video platform Miaopai, where over 9,000 users have commented.
Thousands more have also commented via the Sina Weibo microblog.
Mr Bai has spent seven years and more than one million yuan ($150,000; Â£117,000) on the resort, which is in a spacious mountainous region of Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province.
It has assault courses and long walking paths for the dogs. There is also a cemetery at the site, where 26 of Bai's former ""comrades"" are buried.
In an interview with local paper Qianjiang Evening News in June, Mr Bai explained the reason for setting up the home.
He said it was largely because he didn't want to take the simple route of euthanising one of his dogs, Sonny, after the elderly Alsatian contracted skin cancer.
Mr Bai claimed that rather than following vets' advice and having the animal put to sleep, he spent time giving daily medicinal baths to bring Sonny's illness under control.
After that experience, he said he reached an understanding that retired dogs, much as humans, ""need daily care"".
Mr Bai has been a police dog handler since 2004, and has trained over 30 police dogs. Currently, 16 of his former dogs are residents at the retirement home.
""They have accompanied me for over 10 years; you could say they are my work comrades, or even my family,"" he told local media in June.
Responding to the latest video, Sino Weibo user Pinxieyougong says Mr Bai is ""worth our admiration. We should see more of this [behaviour] across the nation,"" she adds, ""After all, these dogs are civil servants.""
Other users agree, calling the dogs ""national heroes"". One user says they ""should be given a pension"" for the contributions they make to the country.

252,"Accident and emergency waiting times for patients have lagged behind other parts of the UK.
Two years ago, a major hospital in Belfast, Royal Victoria, was said to be ""at breaking point"", as a backlog of patients built up and a major incident was declared.
But, even with the latest provisional figures showing a decline in A&E performance, there is a determination among clinicians and nursing staff to draw a line and build a level of service to be proud of.
There is evidence of a change of mood with the opening in August of an emergency department at Royal Victoria, part of a new Â£150m critical care facility.
Doctors, bruised by the turmoil in the 2013-14 winter, have developed new ways of working, designed to speed the flow of patients through the system.
It's early days, but there are some encouraging signs - in recent months, there has been a 10% year-on-year increase in the number of patients treated or assessed within four hours.
The most recent data for November, though, shows an increase of five percentage points year-on-year.
The hospital points out it has dramatically reduced the number waiting 12 hours or more.
A key policy at the Royal Victoria is putting senior clinicians close to the ""front door"" of the emergency department.
Their task is to quickly triage patients and send them through different treatment streams.

Video: Why hospitals are under so much pressure
Video: How a hospital can grind to a halt
The idea is to avoid a build-up of people waiting in reception.
Badly injured or sick patients are dispatched through the system in the normal way, but a more sophisticated approach has been developed for those who are less seriously ill.
A critical-assessment unit next to the emergency department receives patients, with the aim of dealing with their medical needs within the day.
This could involve an initial appraisal and then sending a patient home for the night with an appointment booked the next day.
Known as a ""virtual ward"", the idea is to carry out treatment without patients needing overnight stays, so reducing pressure on bed occupancy.
Specialist equipment is made available to this unit, allowing doctors to order scans and other procedures to accelerate the patient's progress.
Royal Victoria and other emergency departments are facing deep-rooted pressures.
Northern Ireland does not have a 111 or NHS Direct helpline to guide patients, where appropriate, away from A&E towards other forms of treatment closer to home.
And there are only a few minor injuries clinics to take the pressure off the major hospitals.
The Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board has announced measures to boost GP out-of-hours services and promote alternatives to turning up at A&E.
The NHS has to cope with long-standing health problems in some areas, including mental health, which can be linked to economic decline and deprivation.
The integration of health and social care offers Northern Ireland the opportunity to tackle major problems common to all parts of the United Kingdom.
Problems caring for the elderly at home and in their local communities have left most UK hospitals struggling to discharge patients and free up beds for new patients to occupy.
Southern Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland is pioneering consultant-led care of the elderly in the community, offering, in effect, hospital care in a patient's own home.
The service aims to treat at home patients with a wider range of acute illnesses.
In its first year, the pilot service has prevented about 440 hospital admissions.
With 1.8 million people, it will always be a challenge for Northern Ireland to sustain a full range of NHS services and specialist care.
There is clearly a will to rise to that challenge, but no-one is denying the task may get harder with rising attendances at hospitals, an ageing population and complex health needs.",The NHS in Northern Ireland has not had a good press in recent years.,35112351,"The article discusses the challenges faced by Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast, Northern Ireland in providing adequate emergency care, including long waiting times and overcrowding, but highlights efforts by clinicians and nursing staff to improve services through new ways of working and the opening of a new emergency department.",0,"Article: {}

""I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching,"" Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.
Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ.
He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football.
He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month.
""So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts,"" he added.
The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East.

Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax.
He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title.
Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey.
His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986.
The Dutchman's second spell at Barcelona was even shorter - eight months - as he left midway through the season with the club hovering just above the relegation zone.

He then guided AZ Alkmaar to the 2005-06 Eredivisie title before moving to the Bundesliga, where he helped Bayern Munich to the 2009-10 Bundesliga title.
The Dutch national side approached Van Gaal again in 2012 and this time the Netherlands became one of the first two European countries, along with Italy, to qualify for Brazil 2014, where they finished in third place.
After much speculation, he joined United in May 2014, signing a three-year contract to succeed David Moyes.

259,"The area, which accounts for 21% of all second-home ownership in England, is to get £19.1m of the £60m annual fund.
The money will be distributed to ""community-led"" groups to encourage the building of affordable housing.
Labour's John Healey said last year saw the lowest level of new affordable homes built since 1991.
The government says second-home ownership is at an all-time high and is crowding out first-time buyers by artificially raising prices.
It reports that there were 340,000 second homes in England in 2013/14 - a rise of 98,000 in five years.
In March the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced that £60m raised by an additional 3% on stamp duty on second homes would be spent on ""community-led housing developments in coastal and rural communities"".
The Department for Communities and Local Government said the £60m fund had since been broadened out to include areas with high levels of second homes or where the affordability gap was a particular problem.
It announced that the South West is set to get £19,125,110. This will be split between 25 local authorities in Devon, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly.
The South East - outside London - will receive the second highest amount, £11,336,157. The East of England will get £8.9m, Yorkshire and Humberside £6.4m and the North-West nearly £6m.
Friday's breakdown also includes £2.3m for London, as well as shares for the East Midlands (£2.7m). West Midlands (£1.9m) and north-east England (£1.3m).
In all, 150 councils will share the money over five years, to be distributed to community-led housing groups to spend on building and the development of house-building skills..
Cornelius Olivier, a Labour councillor in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5live: ""We have a big problem in Cornwall in that the gap between what people can earn and what housing costs is bigger than almost anywhere else in the country and one of the main reasons is because we have over 10,000 second homes in Cornwall.""
Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said: ""The high number of second homes can be a frustration for many who struggle to find an affordable home in their community.
""This new fund will help tackle that by boosting supply and making sure community groups are at the heart of delivering new homes, so that this is a country that works for everyone.""
During the first year of the scheme, funding will focus on improving skills and reviewing housing needs in different areas.
It ""must then be used to deliver housing on the ground for local people"" during the second year.
But Labour's Mr Healey said: ""Another day, another announcement but still the lowest level of new affordable homes built last year since 1991.

263,"If that happens, the ice loss could push up global oceans by 2m, or more.
The claim is based on an assessment of the rocks underlying the ice stream.
Scientists tell the journal Nature that should the front of the glacier retreat about 150km from its current position, it will then enter a runaway reversal that takes it 200-250km further inland.
Most of the big glaciers in the east of the White Continent appear relatively quiescent; Totten is something of an exception.
It is experiencing a thinning rate of about half a metre per year, according to the latest satellite measurements.
Previous research indicates this is probably being driven by warm ocean water getting under and melting the floating front of the glacier.
What Alan Aitken and colleagues have now done is examine a possible future for Totten if the shrinkage continues.
They have used gravity and magnetic data recorded over the entire catchment feeding the glacier to understand its past behaviour.
They find that the underlying sedimentary rocks at the modern front of Totten are heavily eroded, as are the rocks in fjords deep in the interior of the catchment. The inference is that these sections are where persistent, moving ice has had time to grind down the geology.
It is the mid-region, however, that piques the team's interest. Here, the sediments are relatively thick, suggesting that ice fronts have historically been resident in this section for only short periods.
This mid-region is also where the rock bed dips inland - a geometry that glaciologists say is naturally unstable and accelerates any glacier retreat.
""What this all tells us is that once the ice margin starts to go back, it goes back quite rapidly to a newer, stable position way inland. And if you do that our modelling indicates you will lose ice equivalent to 1.5-2m of sea level rise,"" co-author Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News.
The last time Totten retreated to the deep interior of the France-sized catchment was probably in the Pliocene Epoch, he added.
""Three-point-five million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were in the region of 400 parts per million - so about where they are now. The atmosphere was a couple of degrees warmer than it is now, which is in line with what we expect for the end of this century if we do nothing about it. The Pliocene is where we're headed.""
Even so, the timescale for the far retreat inland would be on the order of centuries, on current trends.
The international community has of course committed itself to doing something about climate change, promising at the Paris talks in December to try to keep the global atmospheric temperature rise above pre-industrial levels to ""well below 2C"".
Various analyses, however, suggest a 2.7C increase is a more likely outcome, based on the voluntary national curbs to greenhouse gas emissions promised at the meeting.
And that variance could be significant, according to research presented at the recent European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna last month.
Prof Rob DeConto from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, US, has modelled possible ice losses from the Antarctic continent based on the two temperature figures.
For a 2C rise, he found minimal change by the end of this century. On the other hand, for 2.7C he identified ice losses equivalent to many tens of centimetres of sea-level rise.
""There's threshold behaviour in the Antarctic ice sheet system,"" Prof DeConto told reporters at EGU.
""We don't know exactly where that line is, but according to these results somewhere between 2C and 2.7C makes a very big difference.""

264,"Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week.
And McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture.
""He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in,"" McCarthy told BBC Scotland.
""Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner.
""He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good.
""Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now.""
As impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic.
Brendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble.
""I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong,"" McCarthy said. ""It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money.""
Alves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons.
He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £18m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for £4.5m in 2013.
There he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers.
Part of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old.
""He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years,"" he added. ""The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season.""
And the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees.
""Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example,"" McCarthy added.
""He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players. I don't think he'll end up in hot water too many times but he'll bring some fight to that Rangers defence.""",Benni McCarthy says his former Porto team-mate Bruno Alves is the perfect fit for Pedro Caixinha's Rangers.,40143695,"Former Rangers player and current BBC Scotland pundit McCarthy believes the signing of Portuguese international center-back Bruno Alves will be a shrewd move for the club, bringing much-needed experience and leadership to the defense, but notes that more signings of a similar caliber will be needed to seriously challenge Celtic for the Scottish Premiership title.",0,"Article: {}

Miss Partridge, a zookeeper, died a day later. An inquest recorded her death was the result of an accident.
She died from ""an acute bleed"" as a result of a trauma and suffered a cardiac arrest, the inquest heard.
More on Lily Partridge, and other Devon and Cornwall news
Front row forward Miss Partridge, who was a founder member of the Exonian Ladies team based at Topsham RFC, collapsed at the side of the pitch.
Team captain Katie Lunnon said she saw Miss Partridge walk off the pitch and complain of a headache - but nobody saw the clash with an opponent.
She said: ""I didn't really think anything of it as it was very cold and we were soaked through.
""Lily was kneeling down for a bit and then she said she felt sick and was leaning forward on all fours.""
She said the player then collapsed, and was given CPR when she stopped breathing.
The senior university lecturer added Miss Partridge had suffered two concussions earlier that year, for which she had sought medical attention.
Coroner John Tomalin praised Miss Partridge's parents Jeff and Liz for their ""brave decision"" over her organ donation ""at a time when they were trying to cope with the impending death of their daughter"".
Her parents said they wanted to see rugby players at all levels receive proper treatment for head injuries, including brain scans.
However, an expert who gave evidence at her inquest said two previous concussions Miss Partridge had suffered while playing had not contributed to her death.
In a statement, her parents said: ""Lily loved playing rugby and her dream was to represent Devon. She was the victim of a tragic accident.""
They added she had seen her GP after the previous concussions and followed RFU protocols in not playing for a time afterwards.
They added: ""A brain scan may have spotted any weakness caused by those head injuries.
""If we had known that her life may be in danger by playing rugby again, obviously she would have stopped immediately.
""It is a great game involving big, strong, heavy, fit athletes but we need to make it as safe as possible.
""There are many thousands of girls and women playing rugby and Lily, like us, wants that to continue.""
Consultant radiologist Dr Michael Thomas told the hearing Miss Partridge's two previous rugby concussions were not connected to her death.

269,"The key moment was a fumble by Mayo keeper Robert Hennelly early in the second half which gifted Dublin a penalty scored by Diarmuid Connolly.
Hennelly was a late inclusion in place of David Clarke but the move backfired.
Deep in injury-time, Cillian O'Connor missed a difficult free which would have levelled the scores.
Lee Keegan's goal put Mayo ahead midway through the first period but Dublin regrouped to lead 0-10 to 1-6 by half-time.
Hennelly struggled badly with his kick-outs early on with one of his misdirected clearances leading to the black carding of the influential Keegan late in the first half in what was a huge blow for the Connacht county.
Earlier, Dublin's Jonny Cooper was also black carded and a number other players from both sides - notably Dublin's John Small - were fortunate not to suffer the same fate.
In the end, Dublin's stronger bench proved decisive as Cormac Costello came on to kick the champions' three final scores from play.
Cillian O'Connor's ninth point of the contest left the minimum between the teams with three minutes of injury-time left but the Mayo free-taker then missed a high-pressure free from 40 metres which would have levelled the scores again.
As Dublin celebrated back-to-back titles for the first time since the county's triumphs in 1976 and '77, Mayo's players looked crestfallen as they attempted to come to terms with a fifth All-Ireland final defeat in 12 years.
With Hennelly struggling to pick out team-mates from his kick-outs, Dublin moved into a 0-4 to 0-0 lead by the sixth minute which included three Dean Rock points - two of which were from play.
But Mayo were on terms within six minutes after a run of four points started by Patrick Durcan's superb point.
Two Rock frees edged Dublin ahead again but Mayo were suddenly in the lead as the over-lapping Keegan took a perfectly weighted pass from Aidan O'Shea before hammering past Stephen Cluxton from 14 yards.
Cooper's black carding moments later for a hand trip appeared a further boost for Mayo but the Dubs outscored them 0-4 to 0-2 during the remainder of the first period to lead 0-10 to 1-6 at the break.
Mayo regained the lead within two minutes of the restart but were soon three in arrears after another Rock free was followed by Hennelly's howler as he was forced to concede a penalty after spilling a harmless looking ball, with his inevitable black carding followed by Connolly superbly stroking past Clarke.
Mayo cut Dublin's lead to the minimum on four occasions during the remaining half hour of action but their habitual woes of errant shooting and a lack of composure prevented them from getting on terms.
Once again, Aidan O'Shea was not the force that Mayo would have hoped for despite his good work for their first-half goal.

270,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Russian air force would continue its support of the Syrian armed forces.
He also urged Washington to deliver on a pledge to separate moderate Syrian opposition fighters from ""terrorists"".
US Secretary of State John Kerry warned the US was ""on the verge"" of suspending talks with Russia over Syria.
""It's irrational, in the context of the kind of bombing taking place, to be sitting there, trying to take things seriously,"" he told a conference in Washington.
""There is no notion or indication of seriousness of purpose with what is taking place right now.""
The Russian foreign ministry said a US refusal to co-operate would be a gift to ""terrorists"".
The US and Russia have been negotiating for months to try to secure a cessation of hostilities but the latest truce collapsed last week after only a few days and attacks on eastern Aleppo have since intensified.
The US warned on Wednesday it would end talks on military co-operation unless Moscow stopped the bombing.
The recent cessation deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front).
However Russia has complained the US has not done enough to separate the more moderate rebel groups, which it backs, from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Many of these groups have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and fight alongside it.
Despite growing tensions between the two nations, Mr Peskov said Russia remains interested in pursuing talks with the US in an effort to resolve the crisis in Syria.
His comments echo a statement from Moscow, which insisted it would send diplomats to Geneva to discuss ways of normalising the situation with the US.
US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that national security agencies were reviewing all options to try to end the Syrian civil war.
He said President Barack Obama had asked ""all of the agencies to put forward options, some familiar, some new, that we are very actively reviewing"".
""When we are able to work through these in the days ahead we'll have an opportunity to come back and talk about them in detail,"" he said.
Meanwhile Turkey has said it will work with Russia on putting in place another ceasefire after the previous agreement collapsed.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara ""we are more than ready"" but emphasised that nations have to try harder to find a political resolution in order for an agreement to be effective.
Aleppo has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the partial truce deal disintegrated a week ago.
Some 250,000 people are trapped in the east in appalling conditions, under siege from Russian-backed Syrian forces.
UN aid chief Stephen O'Brien has warned that Aleppo is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
Mr O'Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council Aleppo had descended into a ""merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe unlike any we have witnessed in Syria"".

271,"After two hours of talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, he said that the ""two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this relationship"".
Although there was some ""common ground"" on Syria, ""broad differences"" remained.
Mr Lavrov said the two sides needed to overcome ""time-bomb issues"" inherited from Barack Obama's administration.
Tensions have risen since a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last week that left 89 people dead.
The US and its allies blamed the Syrian government, and the US fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase in response.
Syria denied carrying out the chemical attack and has the support of its main ally, Russia, which on Wednesday vetoed a motion brought to the UN Security Council which would have required Bashar al-Assad's government to co-operate with investigators.
It is the eighth time Moscow has used its veto to protect Syria.
Both Mr Tillerson and Mr Lavrov said the discussions were frank.
Mr Tillerson said: ""I expressed the view that the current state of US-Russia relations is at a low point. There is a low level of trust between our two countries.""
He added: ""We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of greatest importance to both of us.""
It was a view echoed by President Donald Trump later, who said at a press briefing with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: ""We may be at an all-time low in terms of our relationship with Russia.""
Mr Trump said ""it would be a fantastic thing"" if the nations improved ties, but warned ""it may be just the opposite"".
Mr Lavrov said a pragmatic conversation was needed to remove the ""irritants that piled up under the Obama administration"".
Both ministers said there was agreement on working towards a stable and unified Syria, and in defeating so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups.
Both agreed to work towards an international investigation of the chemical attack.
But it was obvious there were many differences.
Mr Tillerson said there was clear evidence that the recent chemical attack ""was planned, directed and executed by Syrian regime forces"".
He said the reign of Bashar al-Assad must end and that Mr Trump's description of the Syrian president as ""an animal"" was ""a characterisation President Assad has brought on himself"".
Mr Lavrov said there was no evidence Syria was behind the chemical attack and pointed to the turmoil that had been brought to other nations when leaders had been removed.
There was little concrete to come from the meeting, although the fact Mr Putin granted Mr Tillerson an audience - which had been in doubt - was a measure of success.
Mr Putin did say he was ready to restore the US-Russia air safety agreement over Syria, and Mr Tillerson said there would be working groups set up on smaller issues.
Ahead of the meeting, Mr Lavrov said Russia had ""a lot of questions regarding very ambiguous and contradictory ideas... coming from Washington"".
Afterwards he said ""we understand each other better"" and there were ""many prospects for co-operation with the US"".
He said there were ""certain time-bomb issues inherited from the previous administration - we know to overcome these obstacles we have to make efforts and that the Americans must move towards us as well"".
Earlier, the US and Russian presidents revealed the wide gulf between them over Syria.
Referring to Mr Assad in a Fox Business Network interview, Mr Trump said: ""Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person... if Russia didn't go in and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now."" He later called Mr Assad a ""butcher"".
Speaking on Mir television, Mr Putin rejected allegations that Syria was behind the chemical attack, saying Syria had given up its chemical stockpile.
He said: ""Where is the proof that Syrian troops used chemical weapons? There isn't any.""
Referring to the US air strike, he said: ""But there was a violation of international law. That is an obvious fact.""
And despite hopes that US-Russia ties would improve under a Trump presidency, Mr Putin said: ""One could say that the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved, but rather has deteriorated.""",US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says ties with Russia are at a low point and must improve.,39573744,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov held talks in Moscow, where they acknowledged some areas of common ground but remained deeply divided on key issues, particularly Syria, where the US and Russia have starkly different views on the role of President Bashar al-Assad and the responsibility for a recent chemical attack.",0,"Article: {}

His report warned that immigration officers did not know how many of those told to leave the UK had actually left.
Immigration minister Damian Green blamed the last government - but Labour said the report was damning.
The latest report from the inspector focuses on a previously unknown problem in the UKBA, concerning people from outside Europe who have deadlines to leave the UK.
Many of these people are students and if they do not leave when told to do so, they are added to the ""migration refusal pool"" (MRP).
""There are over 150,000 cases nationally of migrants who have been refused an extension of stay in the UK,"" said Mr Vine.
""The Agency does not know how many of these individuals have left the country or are waiting to be removed.
""I also saw no evidence that there is a clear plan in place for the Agency to deal with this stream of work to ensure this does not become another backlog.
""I believe it can and must do more to demonstrate it is dealing with this issue in a more proactive manner.""
The report said the number of MRP cases had grown from 153,000 in October of last year to almost 160,000 by mid-December.
Mr Vine said: ""The Agency needs much more effective planning in place to deal with this stream of work in order to ensure it removes individuals still in the UK who have no right to be here, while setting out clear performance targets to manage these cases much more effectively.""
Immigration Minister Damian Green said ""Under the last government there was no effective strategy in place to ensure migrants left at the end of their time in the UK. The UK Border Agency is now working through a group of potential over-stayers to identify those who have not left.
""This includes checking passenger records using our e-borders database which now covers all flights outside Europe.

273,"Waiting times are ""unacceptably high"" and must be top priority, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) said in a ""manifesto"" ahead of May's assembly election.
The RCS says almost 450,000 patients are waiting for treatment - 10% higher than three years ago.
But the Welsh government said waiting times have been cut since devolution.
Tim Havard, RCS director and a consultant general surgeon, said people are living longer and the NHS is treating more patients than ever before, which ""must be celebrated"".
But he said much more needs to be done to tackle deteriorating waiting times, which could have a ""huge impact on individual patients"".
""The equivalent of one-in-seven Welsh people are awaiting treatment and there is no sign of this improving,"" he said.
""The 26 and 36 week planned surgery targets are not being met. Instances of patients waiting over a year for knee surgery should not be tolerated.""
Mr Havard said despite initiatives, demand continued to grow.
""Many of the causes of high waiting times are complex and will not be solved overnight, but the focus given to tackling high waiting times in heart surgery demonstrates the NHS can improve access when this is made a priority,"" he added.
The RCS wants all parties to prioritise tackling waiting lists in their election manifestos.
The surgeons' organisation had warned back in July 2013 that cardiac patients were dying waiting for surgery in Cardiff and the Vale.
At the time, 279 patients were waiting longer than the six-month target. Now, only around 42 patients have  long waits.
Heart patients from south and west Wales were treated in hospitals in London, Birmingham and at a private hospital in Bristol, to cut the backlog.
Mr Havard also told BBC Wales that operations were being cancelled on a weekly basis, because of the lack of critical care beds.
A recent report for the Welsh government shows Wales has the lowest number of critical care beds in Europe.
Analysis by Owain Clarke, BBC Wales health correspondent.
If patients face delays before surgery not only do they spend longer in pain but their health can deteriorate meaning more risks
The RCS is concerned the problem is being made worse by too many scheduled operations, even major ones, having to be postponed at the last moment because intensive care beds are not available.
A lot been achieved in reducing delays in cardiac surgery, but the RCS argues ""short term"" solutions are no longer adequate - and in my view that is a clear warning to politicians of all parties.
Some specialist hospital services in Wales - the surgeons argue - are spread too thinly and are close to collapse - yet the RCS thinks politicians have been unable or unwilling to make the case for change.
The RCS in its State of Surgery report also called for:
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We are pleased the Royal College's report recognises people in Wales are living longer thanks to the care they receive from the Welsh NHS, which is treating more patients than ever before.
""This government's top priority is the NHS. Since devolution, waiting times have been cut dramatically. Thanks to our record level of investment in the NHS, today, eight out of 10 patients are waiting less than 26 weeks for treatment, while the average wait at the end of September was just under 11 weeks.""
But the spokesman said an ageing population and ""people's lifestyle choices"" contribute ""significant additional demands"" on the NHS.
""We recognise that waiting times in Wales are too long at present. To tackle this, we have launched the planned care programme to transform the way that services are delivered. A series of plans, designed by clinicians, will help to deliver sustainable services and improve patient experience to ensure patients are seen in the right place, at the right time, by the right person.""
The Welsh Conservatives' Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: ""This is yet more evidence that Welsh patients are getting a raw deal.
""In England, just 6% of the population is on a waiting list. Here, it's 15% - one in seven. That's a national scandal.""

275,"Industry magazine What Car? says prices of VW models have not collapsed as might have been expected.
VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said.
That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke.
However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market.
""I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle,"" said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford.
""That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK.""
The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a ""clean mode"" whenever they were tested for emissions.
VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result.
But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation.
VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception.
The What Car? research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year.
It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.","Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.",37338972,"According to What Car? magazine, the prices of three-year-old Volkswagen models have actually held up relatively well compared to the industry average, with values declining by only 2.7% since September 2015, despite the emissions scandal that broke around that time.",0,"Article: {}

276,"He told Fox News the Democrats were putting out the reports because they were embarrassed at the scale of the election defeat.
On Friday, CIA officials told US media they had concluded that Russians hackers were trying to help Mr Trump.
Russian officials have repeatedly denied the hacking accusations.
Mr Trump said it might have been Russia but it was impossible to know.
""They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody sitting in a bed some place,"" he said.
President Barack Obama has ordered a complete review of the hacks, which targeted emails at the Democratic Party and the emails of a key aide to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
The contents of the emails, passed to Wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the Democrats and shook up the presidential campaign.
Senior Republicans have now joined Democrats in calling for a full investigation.
Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a joint statement on Sunday with top Democrats that the CIA's report ""should alarm every American"".
He said in an interview that the congressional investigation should be more thorough than the one ordered by the White House.
In October, US government officials pointed the finger at Russia, accusing it of meddling in the campaign to undermine the electoral process.
But on Friday, the intelligence community went further when US media reports said the CIA had ""high confidence"" that Russians were trying to influence the election in Mr Trump's favour.
Russians had hacked the Republican party but chose not to reveal the contents of what they found, the reports said.
But Mr Trump told Fox News Sunday: ""I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it.""
He said the Democrats were behind the news reports, not the CIA, because they suffered such a big defeat.
While backing the Obama review, the president-elect warned that it should not pin the blame solely on Russia but on other countries or individuals too.
Republican party spokesman Sean Spicer said the party had not been hacked and the intelligence report was wrong.
Mr Trump also said in the interview he did not need daily intelligence briefings.
""I'm a smart person, I don't need to be told the same thing in the same way for eight years.""
Elsewhere in the interview, he said:
Mr Trump, an outsider who stunned the political world by beating Hillary Clinton in last month's election, will assume office on 20 January.

Among SNP sources, the chatter was that she would give an ultimatum to Theresa May that if she could not negotiate a differentiated Brexit deal for Scotland she would push for a second independence referendum.
Forget that. Scotland's first minister has gone the whole hog, saying she will next week push the button on a second independence referendum by putting legislation to the Scottish Parliament.
Sturgeon can probably win that in Holyrood, but can she win the referendum?
Her announcement will delight her many many supporters.
She is undoubtedly a hugely effective and talented politician. During the last referendum, the SNP's support grew very significantly and they managed to enthuse many thousands of new members to their cause.
But does the SNP have an updated economic argument? Is she willing to risk rancour from many Scottish voters who want another referendum like a hole in the head?
As I've written before, the UK and Holyrood governments are set for a battle royal over timing of a potential vote.
But the question first is whether or not the prime minister is willing to grant a vote. Under the law, Westminster has to grant the referendum; it's not just down to the Scottish government.

287,"They found that targeting a part of the brain called the parietal lobe improved the ability of volunteers to solve numerical problems.
They hope the discovery could help people with dyscalculia, who may struggle with numbers.
Another expert said effects on other brain functions would need checking.
The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology.
Some studies have suggested that up to one in five people have trouble with maths, affecting not just their ability to complete problems but also to manage everyday activities such as telling the time and managing money.
Neuroscientists believe that activity within the parietal lobe plays a crucial role in this ability, or the lack of it.
When magnetic fields were used in earlier research to disrupt electrical activity in this part of the brain, previously numerate volunteers temporarily developed discalculia, finding it much harder to solve maths problems.
The latest research goes a step further, using a one milliamp current to stimulate the parietal lobe of a small number of students.
The current could not be felt, and had no measurable effect on other brain functions.
As it was turned on, the volunteers tried to learn a puzzle which involved substituting numbers for symbols.
Those given the current from right to left across the parietal lobe did significantly better when given, compared to those who were given no electrical stimulation.
The direction of the current was important - those given stimulation running in the opposite direction, left to right, did markedly worse at these puzzles than those given no current, with their ability matching that of an average six-year-old.
The effects were not short-lived, either. When the volunteers whose performance improved was re-tested six months later, the benefits appear to have persisted.
There was no wider effect on general maths ability in either group, just on the ability to complete the puzzles learned as the current was applied.
Dr Cohen Kadosh, who led the study, said: ""We are not advising people to go around giving themselves electric shocks, but we are extremely excited by the potential of our findings and are now looking into the underlying brain changes.
""We've shown before that we can induce dyscalculia, and now it seems we might be able to make someone better at maths, so we really want to see if we can help people with dyscalculia.

""Electrical stimulation is unlikely to turn you into the next Einstein, but if we're lucky it might be able to help some people to cope better with maths.""
Dr Christopher Chambers, from the School of Psychology at Cardiff University, said that the results were ""intriguing"", and offered the prospect not just of improving numerical skills, but having an impact on a wider range of conditions.
He said: ""The ability to tweak activity in parts of the brain, turning it slightly 'up' or 'down' at will, opens the door to treating a range of psychiatric and neurological problems, like compulsive gambling or visual impairments following stroke.""
However, he said that the study did not prove that the learning of maths skills was improved, just that the volunteers were better at linking arbitrary numbers and symbols, and he warned that researchers needed to make sure other parts of the brain were unaffected.
""This is still an exciting new piece of research, but if we don't know how selective the effects of brain stimulation are then we don't know what other brain systems could also be affected, either positively or negatively.""

288,"Sarah Johnson was one of 21 women heading to Liverpool when their minibus was hit by a lorry on the M62.
Her friend Bethany Jones, 18, was killed while Ms Johnson and several others were badly hurt.
Minibus driver James Johnson was jailed for more than six years for causing Bethany's death, in April 2013.
Ms Johnson, who broke her shoulder, back and pelvis, said the help she received from a charity while in hospital led her to want to support others.
Speaking publicly for the first time about the crash, Ms Johnson described how everyone was ""excited and giddy"" for the hen party.
""To me the impact was just a massive explosion,"" she said.  ""I thought the bus had blown up.
""I remember the bus dropping on its side. The next thing, I woke up on the roadside so I'd actually come out of the window.""
Ms Johnson was taken to Leeds General Infirmary where she, along with Bethany's sister Amy Firth, underwent major surgery and spent time in intensive care.
Whilst she was there she got support from charity Day One, which helps victims of major trauma.
She said: ""It's absolutely fantastic.
""It supports people by giving benefit advice, legal advice and peer support such as me and Amy, who have been in similar situations and who are now helping other people who've suffered from major trauma.""

289,"On Tuesday Mr Obama cancelled planned talks after the firebrand Mr Duterte called him the ""son of a whore"".
Wednesday's informal meeting took place before an Asean summit gala dinner.
While a Philippine spokesman said he was ""very happy"" it happened, the US side said they had a ""brief discussion"" in a pre-meal ""hold space"" for leaders.
Mr Obama and Mr Duterte are said to have entered the dinner venue separately at the summit in Laos and did not interact with each other during the event, which lasted one hour and 20 minutes.
""They were the last people to leave the holding room. I can't say how long they met,"" Philippine Foreign Secretary Perfecto Yasay, travelling with Mr Duterte, told reporters shortly afterwards.
""I'm very happy that it happened.""
A White House official said the pair exchanged ""pleasantries"" in a ""brief discussion"" before dinner.
War on drugs
Mr Duterte's outburst came after at a press conference where he told reporters he would not accept Mr Obama raising any concerns about the war on drugs in the Philippines.
""You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. Son of a whore, I will curse you in that forum,"" Mr Duterte said, apparently in reference to the US president.

He had previously urged citizens to shoot to kill drug dealers who resisted arrest, and threatened to ""separate"" from the UN after it called his war on drugs a crime under international law.

291,"Not far away, in Brooklyn Bridge Park, where once derelict piers have been converted into outdoor sports centres, the soccer pitches are usually more crowded than the basketball courts.
A short walk down the hill, an archway under the Manhattan Bridge last summer hosted one of New York's World Cup ""viewing parties"", where thousands gathered to watch games, and not just those involving the American national team.
So it seemed incongruous to stand in front of the courthouse last week, fielding questions from presenters in London about why a country with no interest in football had suddenly assumed the role of global policeman of the global game.
That line of inquiry seemed about a decade out of date.  It is akin to the blanket condemnation that Americans lack a sense of humour or irony - this in the land of Jon Stewart, Tina Fey, Stephen Colbert, Chris Rock, Amy Poehler, Jerry Seinfeld, David Letterman and Garry Shandling.
True, football, or soccer as it is known here, is not as central to American as it is to European, African or South and Central American life. Nowhere near.
Up until recently, the game has been unloved by the major US television networks, which have long bemoaned the lack of breaks in play, the paucity of goals and the glut of draws.
Absent from the US game are big-name male stars and big-name clubs. The New York Red Bulls will never rival the New York Yankees. Real Salt Lake pales, rather risibly, alongside Real Madrid.
However, football is no longer met with American indifference. Nor any more does it offer proof of America's sporting isolationism. In this polyglot nation, the game is growing in popularity and importance, an upward trend that will continue long into the future as America becomes less white and more Hispanic.
Already, America is the number one country in the world for youth participation in football. More than three million youngsters were registered to play in 2014, compared with just 103,432 in 1974.
Major League Soccer matches now have a higher average attendance - 19,148 in 2014 - than basketball and ice hockey. The game ranks third after American football and baseball.
Though the crowds here are significantly smaller than in the Bundesliga in Germany, the Premier League in England and Wales, La Liga in Spain or Serie A in Italy, they are on average bigger than in Argentina, Brazil, China or the Football League Championship.
Bundesliga: 43,532
Premier League: 36,083
La Liga: 26,803
Serie A: 22,019
Major League Soccer (in 2014): 19,148
The Seattle Sounders, America's most-watched team, attracts larger crowds for home games than Everton, Tottenham, Aston Villa or even Chelsea.
The strength of the game in Seattle is also a measure of how its popularity extends well beyond the new immigrant hubs of New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
Sporting Kansas City, in the American heartland, is also one of the better-supported sides.
Last year's World Cup in Brazil witnessed record viewing figures in America, even though the national team did not make it past the final 16.
And even after it exited the tournament, viewers kept tuning in - 29.2 million for the final between Germany and Argentina.
By comparison, that year's baseball world series attracted 13.5 million.
Nor is American enthusiasm for the World Cup a new phenomenon - more than 18 million people watched the 1994 final between Brazil and Italy - but it has been growing.
The average viewing figure for matches in last year's World Cup matches was 4.3 million, up 50% from 2010.
All those kids who grew up playing the game are now, as adults, watching it.

Football in America also transcends the gender divide.
Of the kids playing the game, 48% are girls.
The USA has twice won Fifa's Women's World Cup, a record matched only by Germany.
Mia Hamm, who accumulated a staggering 275 caps and scored 158 international goals, has been called America's greatest female athlete of the past 40 years.
In terms of her marketability, Nike ranked her alongside Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan.
It is also worth remembering that one of the most sought after demographics in American politics is the country's army of suburban ""soccer moms.""
The term is hardly new. It was coined in the mid-1990s.
Money is another indicator of the game's attractiveness.
NBC splashed out $240m (Â£160m) for the rights to Premier League football between 2013-16, three times more than Fox paid for the previous contract.
With a fierce bidding war now under way, the next deal is expected to dwarf that figure.
The wider availability of Premier League matches, which attract much bigger television audiences than domestic games, is also helping to raise the profile of the sport.
Gone are the days when diehard fans used to have to find bars open on a Saturday morning with satellite feeds beamed in from Europe.
Now every single Premier League game is available on cable. Ditto the FA Cup and Uefa Champions League.
On Univision, the American Spanish language network with viewing figures on a par with the major US networks, soccer, unsurprisingly, is the number one sport. Broadcasting live matches has fuelled the channel's rapid rise.
No longer do foreigners have to explain the intricacies of the offside rule to perplexed locals, or why games are allowed to finish in a tie (a draw).
Many Americans are now fully literate in the sport.
So while American soccer may never rival American football, the notion that it remains a niche sport is absurd.
Though gridiron, baseball, basketball and ice hockey are known here as the ""Big Four"" sports, soccer has surely ousted ice hockey to join that quartet.
It is the fourth most popular high school sport for boys, and the third for girls.
There are many reasons why the US Department of Justice mounted these prosecutions.
Two of those indicted, Jeffrey Webb and Chuck Blazer, were dominant figures in the American game.
Jack Warner, of Trinidad and Tobago, used to head up Concacaf, the Miami-based Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football.
Prosecutors claim the alleged bribery scheme relied heavily on the US banking system.
But although the US authorities have also targeted foreign nationals, they do not regard soccer as a foreign sport.
Announcing the charges, FBI director James Comey stressed how American kids and others at the grassroots had been deprived of resources.
The FBI has cast a global dragnet, but this is also a homeland investigation.

Mrs May noted Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick, was a Labour member.
Sir Tony later described the pair as ""a beardy man and a grumpy lady"".
During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn and Mrs May argued over the government's yet-to-be-announced stance for when negotiations for leaving the European Union begin next year.
The Labour leader accused the prime minister of presiding over a ""shambolic Tory Brexit"" and called for clarity and warned of the effect of it might have on the Irish border.
Mrs May pledged no return to the ""borders of the past"", saying a Common Travel Area had existed since 1923, and accused Mr Corbyn of trying to ""frustrate the will of the British people"" over the EU referendum.
The government has said it will formally trigger Brexit talks by the end of next March, but has consistently refused to offer a ""running commentary"" on its negotiating stance.
Prime Minister's Questions took an unusual turn when Mr Corbyn made reference to Baldrick, the turnip-loving and intellectually challenged servant to Rowan Atkinson's 1980s historical comedy character Edmund Blackadder.
He said: ""When you're searching for the real meaning and the importance behind the prime minister's statement (on the recent European Council summit), you have to consult the great philosophers.
""The only one I could come up with is Baldrick, who says, 'Our cunning plan is to have no plan.""'
This was a reference to Baldrick's frequent claim to have a ""cunning plan"" to deal with the trickiest situations, but which nearly always turned out to be less than brilliant.
Mrs May responded: ""I'm interested that you chose Baldrick. Of course, the actor playing Baldrick was a member of the Labour Party, as I recall.""
Sir Tony is a long-serving activist who has chaired proceedings at the party's annual conference - he has also been a recent critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.
The reference prompted him to tweet, mocking Mrs May's oft-used pledge that ""Brexit means Brexit"", by saying ""Baldrick means Baldrick"".
""I'm in the hairdresser's,"" he later added. ""Suddenly a lot of people seem to want to talk to me!""

It come as another contender, Yvette Cooper, sets out a plan to create two million high tech jobs.
Ms Cooper, Ms Kendall, Andy Burnham and Jeremy Corbyn will take part in a leadership hustings later.
The four MPs are vying to succeed Mr Miliband as Labour leader, with the result of the election to be announced in early September.
The campaign so far has been dominated by the candidates' attitudes to Labour's election defeat and how far they are willing to distance themselves from the policies put forward by Mr Miliband.
Claims by Ms Kendall and her supporters that only she would break from the past have led to a war of words between their rival camps.
In an interview with the Sun, Ms Kendall said she made no apology for calling for a complete change of approach, claiming that ""if we stick with what we have been saying for the last five or eight years, we will have the same result"".
""I think I am the only person in this race that isn't continuity Miliband,"" she said. ""The other candidates haven't spelled out how they would be different from Ed Miliband.""
In a direct appeal to readers of the Sun, which was highly critical of Mr Miliband's leadership, Ms Kendall said Labour needed to show it could be trusted with people's money and had more to say to homeowners and those who run their own business.
""We have got to get back to the values of the British people - work, responsibility, wanting to get on, wanting to be a success, and being proud of that - not making people ashamed or think somehow that they are doing something wrong.""
During a campaign visit to the University of Manchester, Ms Cooper will argue that Britain is being ""left behind"" as a country, with its spending on research and development and science lagging behind that of other comparable European economies.
Even when major scientific discoveries are made in the UK, such as with graphene - a material that has been been touted as having the scope to transform electronics - she said the UK has often been slow to exploit their commercial potential.
Acknowledging that Labour's relationship with business is in ""real need of recovery"", she said a future Labour government must aspire to spend 3% of the UK's national output on science and R&D to bring it into line with the likes of Germany.
Such a financial commitment, backed by a 10-year plan, was needed to create two million high-skilled manufacturing jobs, she said.
""Britain can't compete with Brazil or Indonesia on low-wage, low-skills jobs,"" she said.
""But with high-skilled jobs in emergent technologies, in the harnessing of new technologies such as graphene, we can do what we've done before: punch well above our weight as a small island off the coast of Europe. That should be Labour's mission.""
All small businesses, she argued, should have guaranteed access to high-speed broadband since the digital economy was crucial to Britain's future long-term competitiveness.
Stressing that Labour must be the champion of innovation as the route to greater productivity, she recalled Harold Wilson's famous prediction in 1963 that a new Britain would be forged in the ""white heat"" of a scientific revolution.
""Just as Labour championed the white heat of technology in the 1960s, so today we need to champion the white flashing constellations of the networked world"".

305,"Bertrand Traore, playing as a central striker, gave the Blues the lead when he took Nemanja Matic's pass, turned and fired home from 20 yards out.
The Potters deservedly levelled when Xherdan Shaqiri's cross was punched by Chelsea keeper Thibaut Courtois to Diouf, who headed into an empty net.
Bojan almost won it for the Potters in injury time but Courtois denied him.
Stoke remain seventh in the table, with Chelsea 10th - three points behind them.
The Blues named a team with Wednesday's Champions League game against Paris St-Germain in mind. Striker Diego Costa, who had a minor tendon injury, was not risked, while midfielder Cesc Fabregas was left on the bench.
Burkina Faso forward Traore started centrally, with recognised strikers Loic Remy and Alexandre Pato on the bench, and his goal was the one real moment of quality in the game.
He found space outside the box before firing a great shot past Jack Butland - his fourth goal in five games.
However, he had a mixed game, failing to control the ball in the box on a couple of occasions and being caught offside needlessly.
He was replaced after 68 minutes by Remy, who made little impact.
Chelsea could have had a penalty when Marc Muniesa leaned on Oscar in the box but there were only muted appeals for a spot-kick.
The Potters had won their previous three Premier League games and started the day five points off the Champions League places.
Mark Hughes named an attacking line-up at the home of the soon-to-be dethroned champions, with Ibrahim Afellay, Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic starting behind Diouf. When Bojan replaced Glenn Whelan, they had five forwards on the pitch.
And just when it looked like their luck might be out - Courtois had done well to deny Shaqiri and Arnautovic - they got their reward.
With Joselu waiting on the touchline to replace Diouf, the Senegal striker headed home after Courtois failed to adequately deal with Shaqiri's cross. That was his last touch.
Hughes told BBC Sport: ""That's the bit of luck you need. He put a great shift in. He was looking a bit tired so I thought I'd freshen it up. Luckily he scored just before I brought him off.""
Stoke boss Mark Hughes told BBC Sport: ""We're grateful to equalise but we deserved more from the game. It was an excellent away performance - we took the game to Chelsea. We were encouraged by the team they picked.

""I was a bit surprised with their team. I thought they had a chance to get in the Champions League.
""We're really pleased with the performance. Their goal came out of the blue, it was a great bit of individual skill. I felt we were a strong team and made things happen.""
Chelsea interim boss Guus Hiddink told BBC Sport: ""Stoke play well and creatively and they pushed us back. The first goal we got after a sloppy start, it was a beautiful goal.
""We should have got a penalty for a foul on Oscar. Any referee would have given a free-kick if it was outside the box. That was a key point. Stoke got some encouragement after that.

""We have rested one or two players but it's good to see the players who came in, especially the young ones, like Traore and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, do well.
""Everyone knows in December we were one point off the relegation zone. There was a little bit of panic. Through a lot of draws at the beginning, we moved away and then we had to make the next step with victories, which we did.""
Chelsea's next two games will have more of an impact on their chances of winning a trophy than the Stoke fixture.
On Wednesday, they try to overhaul a 2-1 first-leg deficit against PSG in the Champions League last 16, while next Saturday they go to Everton in the FA Cup quarter-finals.
Stoke's next game is at home to Southampton next Saturday.

306,"When we arrived in darkness all was calm and quiet.
We were greeted courteously by men carrying copies of the US constitution, who told us they were unarmed.
They had draped the US flag over a sign at the entrance to the wildlife refuge and they offered us a cup of coffee.
The guards told us that the armed men inside were not taking visitors at present but would be happy to come out and meet the media face to face in the morning.
One of the men tried to give me a small US Fish and Wildlife Service sign from the building ""as a souvenir"".
""It's mine,"" he said, ""I paid for it,"" making a reference to his taxes.
A short distance away, down a slope in the darkness, sat the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge itself, a collection of more than a dozen buildings which serves as the headquarters for a sanctuary established by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908.
A spot popular with birdwatchers keen to catch a glimpse of a greater sandhill crane may seem an improbable symbol of oppression but the men here insist the federal government has overreached its authority and has no right to this land.
The refuge abuts property owned by the two men whose incarceration sparked this whole protest, Dwight Hammond and his son Steven.
Their lawyer told the BBC that the Hammonds, who have already served time in prison for setting fires which spread to public land, had travelled to California on Sunday to hand themselves in after federal prosecutors won an appeal that resulted in lengthier jail terms.
Publicly they have distanced themselves from the action, taken by people who are not neighbours or locals.
But some people in the community around the town of Burns say while they do not approve of the methods, they are in tune with the sentiment.
Back at the bird reserve, the mood changed slightly as the day dawned, the birds started singing and the winter sun struggled to pierce the hazy clouds.
The media were now at the gate in force and the men there were more reluctant to talk.
""We need to stick to the narrative,"" one told us as he explained why we needed to wait for their leader Ammon Bundy.
Down a slight hill, we could now see the headquarters clearly, the red roofs of the sheds standing out against the snow.
Several dark-clad figures moved around in the complex.
At the top of a metal observation tower two men surveyed the surroundings.
There was not much for them to see apart from satellite trucks, camera crews and a solitary, unexplained drone.
For miles around there was no sign at all of any law enforcement officers although the word in Burns, some 30 minutes away, is that the hotels are packed with FBI agents.
Critics of this occupation are putting pressure on the federal authorities to enforce the law and end it. They have accused the occupiers of this building of being domestic terrorists, using force to impose their will.
Those involved insist they are patriots and they claim they have the law on their side. The US constitution prohibits the federal government from owning this land, they say.
When Mr Bundy emerged to speak to the media he refused to tell me how many people were inside the bird sanctuary or how many were armed but, after the news conference, camera crews were given a limited tour of the site.
Several children also came along although the militia men said the youngsters were visitors who were not staying on the site.
We were told we would not be shown anything relating to ""operational security"" or anything that would ""put lives at risk"" and, indeed, we were kept away from any weapons on the site.
A number of US government vehicles sat in the car park, covered in snow.
We were not allowed into most of the buildings and saw no more than a dozen men and one woman inside.
We were taken into a building where one of the protestors said he had been sleeping. It appeared to be a gym for the federal employees who usually manage this land.
There were cans of chicken noodle soup, oranges, apples and other food.
Through a glass window we could see a man and a woman cooking food in a kitchen. The site appeared to be in good condition.
Not all of the men here were keen to talk but those who were have urged supporters to take up arms and join them to assert the rights of ranchers in the American west, rights which they say have been trampled by a federal government over-reaching its authority.
They say they are prepared to stay here for years to make that point and, so far, there is no sign at all of them leaving or being forced from this land.
But with the absence of law enforcement this is not a stand-off. Not yet anyway.",The latest clash between Washington and the west is playing out on a snowy desert plain in the wilds of Oregon.,35229017,"A group of armed anti-government protesters, led by Ammon Bundy, have taken over the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon, protesting the federal government's ownership of the land and demanding that the Hammond family, whose incarceration sparked the protest, be released from prison, with the occupiers claiming to have the law on their side and refusing to leave despite pressure from authorities.",1,"Article: {}

The first carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is expected to be operational in 2020.
""We are going to see a bigger Royal Navy and the flagship... will be here in Portsmouth,"" Michael Fallon said.
The 60 Pacific 24 rigid-hulled inflatable boats will be built by BAE systems to ""guard the carriers in the harbour and our new frigates and destroyers"", Mr Fallon said.
He said they will also enhance security by providing a rapid response in rescue, anti-piracy and counter-narcotics missions in the area.
Mr Fallon said: ""Through the defence review, defence spending is going to go up every April for the rest of this parliament.
He said as part of the larger investment, the government will also be able to provide the new aircraft carriers with sufficient fighter jets.
""We have said we will maintain a minimum fleet of 19 destroyers and frigates, but as the older frigates are retired we also hope to add a lighter frigate between the offshore patrol vessel and Type 26 and to build more of those as well.""
Mr Fallon's visit to Portsmouth Naval Base comes as work has begun to rebuild the jetty for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2017.
Floating cranes are also dredging Portsmouth harbour to prepare deeper channels for the aircraft carriers to sail from the base, which are the largest ships ever built for the Royal Navy.
""This is a huge financial investment in making sure the channel is wide enough, in enlarging the jetty here so they can take the carriers and in making sure the carriers are properly guarded,"" Mr Fallon said.
Taller than Nelson's Column and longer than Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower laid on its side, the new carriers will displace 65,000 tonnes of water.
To make room for the carriers three million cubic metres of clay, sand and gravel will be removed from a two-mile stretch of Portsmouth Harbour covering an area the size of 200 football pitches.","Increased spending will result in a ""bigger"" Royal Navy, the defence secretary has said, as he announced a new £13.5m shipbuilding contract.",35095379,"Sixty patrol boats will be built and deployed to protect the UK's two new aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth, which is expected to be operational in 2020, and the larger Royal Navy, with the government also investing in additional fighter jets and frigates to maintain a minimum fleet of 19 destroyers and frigates.",1,"Article: {}

308,"Three first-half goals in the space of 10 minutes sentenced the O's to a fourth successive defeat as Crawley tasted victory for the first time in seven matches.
Orient edged the opening exchanges but lost defender Tom Parkes through injury before Steven Alzate was denied on the edge of the area by keeper Glenn Morris.
Crawley had failed to score in their previous three home games but leading marksman James Collins swooped to give them the lead with his 20th goal of the season midway through the half.
The former Shrewsbury striker struck by heading in a free-kick from Josh Payne and, although keeper Sam Sargeant got a hand to the ball, it flew into the corner of the net.
Crawley took a firm grip of the game by scoring twice in the space of four minutes before the interval.
Defender Joe McNerney rose unchallenged to head home a Payne free-kick from 12 yards on 29 minutes and then, from an Andre Blackman set-piece, Dutch midfielder Enzio Boldewijn forced the ball home.
Crawley, who had won only two of their previous 13 games, threatened again when a header from skipper Jimmy Smith was saved by Sargeant shortly after the break.
Boldewijn, after earlier firing wide from 25 yards, should have increased the lead when putting the ball wastefully wide from a pass by Collins.

310,"Maya Kodnani, an ex-minister and aide to Chief Minister Narendra Modi, is the most senior figure so far convicted.
Thirty others received life sentences for their part in the killings in Naroda Patiya, a suburb of Ahmedabad.
The riots left more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead, and were among India's worst outbreaks of unrest.
The rioting began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a train fire blamed on Muslims in the town of Godhra.
Kodnani was not a minister at the time of the riots, but was appointed junior minister for women and child development by Mr Modi in 2007.
She quit her post when she was arrested in 2009 in connection with the massacre but remained a member of the state assembly.
On Wednesday she was convicted of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy. Thirty-one others were also found guilty of involvement in the case. One of those convicted has never been brought to justice and was tried in absentia.
Babu Bajrangi, a former leader of the hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal, was found guilty on the same charges as Kodnani. He has been sentenced to remain in jail until he dies.
Announcing the sentences on Friday, Judge Jyotsna Yagnik named Kodnani as ""a kingpin of riots"" in the Naroda Patiya area.
""Communal riots are like cancer on constitutional secularism and the incident in Naroda Patiya was a black chapter in the history of the Indian constitution,"" the Press Trust of India quoted him as saying.
""Acts of communal [religious] violence are brutal, inhuman and shameful. It was a clear incident of human rights violation as 97 people were killed brutally within a day which included helpless women, children, aged persons.
""The climax of this inhuman and brutal act of violence was reflected in [the] murder of an infant, who was 20 days old,"" the judge said.
Following Kodnani's conviction on Wednesday, Gujarat's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government quickly distanced itself from her saying that she had not been a state minister at the time of the riots.
Correspondents, however, say her conviction is an embarrassment for Mr Modi who elevated her to ministerial office in 2007 despite being aware that her role in the riots was being investigated.
Gujarat assembly elections are due later in the year and the Congress party is bound to use the court ruling to criticise Mr Modi during the campaign.
Mr Modi, touted by some as a future prime minister, has been accused of not doing anything to stop the riots - a charge he has always denied.
Ninety-five bodies were found after the Naroda Patiya massacre - the worst of the Gujarat riots cases - on 28 February 2002. The bodies of two other people missing after the massacre and presumed dead were never found.
The trial began in August 2009 and charges were brought against 62 people. One of the accused died during the trial.

311,"Tumours can ""seed"" themselves elsewhere in the body and this process is behind 90% of cancer deaths.
The mouse study, published in Nature, showed altering the immune system slowed the spread of skin cancers to the lungs.
Cancer Research UK said the early work gave new insight into how tumours spread and may lead to new treatments.
The spread of cancer - known as metastasis - is a fight between a rapidly mutating cancer and the rest of the body.
The team at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge was trying to figure out what affected tumour spread in the body.
Researchers created 810 sets of genetically modified lab mice to discover which sections of the DNA were involved in the body resisting a cancer's spread.
The animals were injected with melanomas (skin cancer) and the team counted the number of tumours that formed in the lung.
Their hunt led them to discover 23 sections of DNA, or genes, that made it either easier or harder for a cancer to spread.
Many of them were involved in controlling the immune system.
Targeting one gene - called Spns2 - led to a three-quarters reduction in tumours spreading to the lungs.
""It regulated the balance of immune cells within the lung,"" Dr David Adams, one of the team, told the BBC News website.
""It changes the balance of cells that play a role in killing tumour cells and those that switch off the immune system.""
The field of immunotherapy - harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer - has delivered dramatic results for some patients.
A rare few with a terminal diagnosis have seen all signs of cancer disappear from their body, although the drugs still fail to work in many patients.
Dr Adams said: ""We've learnt some interesting new biology that we might be able to use - it's told us this gene is involved in tumour growth.""
Drugs that target Spns2 could produce the same cancer-slowing effect but that remains a distant prospect.
Dr Justine Alford, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study in mice gives a new insight into the genes that play a role in cancer spreading and may highlight a potential way to treat cancer in the future.
""Cancer that has spread is tough to treat, so research such as this is vital in the search for ways to tackle this process.""

In fact, vegetable oil, specifically soy bean oil and palm oil, are two of the eight ingredients, alongside wheat, rice, maize, sugar, barley and potato, that are now estimated to provide a staggering 85% of the world's calories.
Increasingly, no matter what country we live in, we all eat similar diets which are heavy in calories and low in nutrients.
It's a development that Prof Benton, a strategic research dean at the University of Leeds specialising in food security and sustainability, links directly to global trade.
The production of vegetable oils and oil crops have both increased considerably over the past three decades.
The rise has been  driven by a combination of trade agreements, which have made it cheaper and easier to export and import oil, and various government policies. Policy incentives in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, aimed at ramping up production for export, have helped to lower the cost of vegetable oil, for example.
""Competing in a global market requires a highly efficient production process driving scale and cheapness. Now we have a food system built on incredibly cheap calories,"" says Prof Benton.
Of course, this food trade has in many cases helped reduce famine and, as Prof Benton points out, means the ""poorest of poor have access to cheap calories"".
But he says this trade - which means more people are eating less healthy imports, rather than what is locally available - may also have helped to make us fatter.
Over 50% of the world's population is not of a ""healthy weight"", according to Prof Benton's recent report on food production. And worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980.
""The poorest anywhere still struggle to get sufficient calories and are underweight, but in our rich countries, poverty often does not stop people being able to eat (and drink) calories, but it does stop them having a nutrient-rich diet,"" the report says.
Prof Corinna Hawkes, director of the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London, says the greatest increase in sources of calories since the globalisation era began, has come from oil crops.
""There was a very sudden and marked increase in the availability of soybean and palm oil and that to me is directly related with policies that made it easier to trade,"" she says.
Oilseeds are now among the most widely traded crops, and most processed foods contain either palm oil or soybean oil, which can help extend shelf life, she says.
""Because it became much easier and cheaper for the processed food industry to import it there was no disincentive for using it,"" she says.
A small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet. But fats are high in calories so eating a lot can increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese. Saturated and trans fats are also associated with heart disease.
Prof Hawkes says that the low cost and availability of oil has meant some countries' cooking habits have changed. In China, for example, food is deep fried in high quantities of oil and in Brazil, people use larger amounts of oil in traditional dishes.
But alongside the increased trade of oil crops, she says, it's important to note that trade in fruit and vegetables has also increased, meaning many people's diets have actually improved.
This discrepancy is what Prof Hawkes calls the ""quinoa question"". Increasing western demand for the so-called ""superfood"", which has been grown high in the Andes for thousands of years, has been blamed for its skyrocketing price and unavailability for people in the countries it first came from.
The question goes to the heart of the controversy surrounding globalisation: that its rise has disproportionately benefited people who are already advantaged.
So while people clued-up on nutrition and health may be getting healthier thanks to global trade, those without this knowledge have seen their diet deteriorate.
However, the findings of a recent study by the London School of Economics (LSE), which looked at 26 countries between 1989 and 2005 when globalisation dramatically expanded, contradict this.
The research concluded that ""social globalisation"" - changes in the way we work and live - was what was making us fat, rather than the wider availability of cheaper and more calorific foods driven by global trade.
Basically, the fact that we are are now increasingly able to work, shop and socialise whilst barely moving a muscle is to blame, says study author Dr Joan Costa-Font.
""Our food intake is driven towards meeting the needs of a pre-global [socially speaking] world, where people would have to walk to places, and where there would not be as many energy-saving activities as today. Individuals would have closer personal social contacts, and would cook and spend more time on daily chores,"" he says.
Dr Costa-Font says the research suggests that once people adapt their diet and lifestyle to these changes - basically move more and eat less - more normal weights will again prevail.
He points to the US as an example. While obesity levels are alarmingly high at almost 35%, he notes that this level has stayed pretty much the same over the past decade.
""That's good news. That's already something.
""It may be that the US is beginning to start to learn how to eat and adjust its lifestyle to a global one. The hypothesis is that this rise in obesity is only transitory.""","A teaspoon of oil, measured out with precision, is how Professor Tim Benton remembers his mother preparing items for frying.",39254804,"The globalization of food trade has led to a significant increase in the availability and affordability of vegetable oils, particularly soybean and palm oil, which has resulted in a shift towards a more calorie-dense diet that is high in unhealthy fats and low in nutrients, leading to an increase in obesity rates worldwide, but there is evidence to suggest that social changes driven by globalization, rather than the availability of cheaper foods, may be the primary cause of this trend.",0,"Article: {}

318,"They were made 110 years ago by the Wall family who lived in New Southgate in North London.
There are 24 clear recordings on wax cylinders which were made using a phonograph machine between 1902 and 1917.
Music curators say the sound quality of the music recorded is outstanding.
The recordings were found at the former home of David Brown, Cromwell Wall's grandson, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire and donated to St Neot's Museum. It was then discovered that the recordings were made in London.
Cromwell Wall's great-great grandchildren, Layla and Zac Jordan, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, heard the recordings for the first time when they visited the Museum of London.
Cromwell and Minnie Wall had nine children, eight of whom appear on the recordings. All the recordings are bursting with vibrancy and life, according to Julia Hoffbrand who is the curator at the Museum of London who helped restore the recordings.
""When I first heard the recordings the hairs on my arms stood on end,"" she said. ""It was fantastic. We had an idea of what was on the recordings because Cromwell had written very full descriptions on the cylinder boxes but it was really like a window opening into the past. It was like being in the same room as the family and their friends"".
Many of the recordings were made at family gatherings over Christmas and New Year.
Cromwell Wall, who made the recordings, wheeled the phonograph along the streets in his children's pram in order to record the sound of Old Southgate Church bells pealing out New Year.
Some of the later recordings were made during WWI when three of the sons, who feature in earlier recordings were away at war. One son, Oliver, died of pneumonia in a French hospital three weeks before peace was declared.
The recordings were restored this summer and many of the relatives heard them for the first time in October. It brought back some great memories for Oliver Wall, one of Cromwell's grandchildren.
""It was a wonderful atmosphere. I remember the occasions always at Christmas and we always had big parties and singing round the piano with grandpa playing and he used to take us marching upstairs and all over the big house they had.""
His cousin Daphne reminisces how their grandfather used to dress up as Father Christmas.
""There was a great deal of excitement,"" she said. ""It was fun!""
It is very unusual for recordings on wax phonograph cylinders to survive for so long. Phonographs were introduced for use in offices as dictating machines and so it is extremely rare for them to be used to record domestic sounds and occasions.
""We were thrilled,"" says Julia Hoffbrand. ""Phonographs and cylinders were expensive so you had to have a certain level of income to record and a level of skill and care to make recordings and to take care of the cylinders.""
The cylinders themselves are similar to old fashioned vinyl records in that the phonograph would make indentations into the cylinder which could then be replayed.  Bill Lowry, digital collections manager at the Museum was among those who helped restore the cylinders.
""We tried to reduce any noise by cleaning the cylinder first with a fine brush that can get in between the groove and once we had the best playback from the cylinder we then digitally cleaned them up.""

Ying Ying was sent to mainland China's Sichuan province this spring to take part in a breeding programme.
The 100kg female - described by the park as ""inquisitive, active and vigilant"" - attempted to mate naturally with two male pandas on five different occasions and one of the attempts was deemed successful.

Its most recent survey suggested that prices went up by 9% in the year to November.
London remained the strongest performing region for the fifth year running, with average prices up 12% compared with a year ago, according to Nationwide.
But it did not expect house prices in the capital to continue to see above average growth next year, pointing to the fact that property was becoming unaffordable for many in the city.
Average prices in the London are now 50% above their pre-crisis peak in 2007, while in contrast property values in Northern Ireland remain 44% below their pre-crisis peak, despite rising by 6.5% in the last three months of the year.

Scotland was the only part of the UK that saw a fall in average house prices, with values down 1.9% in the three months to the end of December compared with the same period a year ago.

""Further healthy gains in employment and rising wages are likely to bolster buyer sentiment, while borrowing costs are expected to rise only gradually.

City should have gone ahead through Scotland's Jane Ross, but she hesitated after rounding the Brondby goalkeeper.

Facing an organised Brondby outfit who have reached the semi-finals on three occasions, City struggled to create chances in the first half but right-back Lucy Bronze did force a good low save from visiting keeper Katrine Abel.
The hosts could have gone behind, but England stopper Karen Bardsley was alert to produce a low, one-handed save to deny Nanna Christiansen.
After half-time the energetic Ross raced clear and calmly rounded Abel, but, with the goal gaping, defender Simone Sorensen had time to recover and intercept the danger.

Universities will be asked to publicly justify how they can pay their heads more than the prime minister.
The question of university value has been under scrutiny, with fees increasing to £9,250 in England.
In a speech to university leaders on Thursday, Mr Johnson will call for universities to set out much clearer contracts for students on what they can expect.
He will promise better ""consumer protection"" for students.
An annual study has shown a decreasing sense of value for money among students - with concerns about getting fewer teaching hours than they expected.
Mr Johnson will highlight concerns over increases in vice-chancellors' pay - with dozens of university heads now receiving over £300,000 and some being paid more than £400,000.
""When students and taxpayers invest so heavily in our higher education system, value for money should be guaranteed.  Yet, I am still hearing students say that their course is poor quality.
""This is not good enough, especially when some vice-chancellors take home a wage that in some cases exceeds that of the prime minister.""
There have been concerns about the rising costs of university in England - with tuition fees increasing to £9,250 and interest rates on loans rising to 6.1%.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that average debts for graduates will now be over £50,000 - and that interest charges will have reached £5,800 before students have even graduated.
Former education minister Lord Adonis says such high levels of interest are ""indefensible"" and predicts that they will be changed.
And the head of the Russell Group of leading universities has described such interest charges as ""out of touch"" and called for them to be reviewed.

The main contributor to growth was streaming, but vinyl revenues rose by more than two thirds.
However, more revenues could be generated by platforms such as Youtube, the BPI said.
Revenue from physical formats dipped below £300m last year, but remained just above the £274m generated by streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer.
Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards, said the increase in revenues was encouraging, as more and more consumers enjoyed the benefits of subscribing to a streaming service or rediscovered the joys of vinyl.
""Britain's world-leading music sector has the potential for sustained growth in the years ahead, but this exciting future can only be realised if government makes creative businesses a priority post-Brexit,"" he added.
UK artists needed to be able to tour freely in EU markets, and UK businesses needed to be able to employ the best talent, Mr Taylor argued.
He added that strong intellectual property protections would need to be included in trade talks with third party countries.
An International Trade spokeswoman said: ""Music is one of our most important exports and trade policy has a key role in supporting growth in this market.
""We will in due course explore all options in the design of future trade agreements, including the role of intellectual property rights in boosting UK exports in overseas markets.""
Streaming revenues jumped more than 60% in 2016, and accounted for close to a third of label revenues.
The BPI said streaming would overtake revenues from physical sales in 2017.
However, the association added that there was a ""growing mismatch between the huge value that certain digital platforms, such as YouTube, extract from music or other entertainment and the relatively small amount they return back to the creators concerned"".

329,"Some two dozen behemoths were identified, all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the Sun.
Four were known previously, including the remarkable colossus catalogued as R136a1, which is 250 times as massive as our home star.
But the new survey finds many more of the super-objects in a tight patch of sky within the Large Magellanic Cloud.
""In just a tiny bit of this satellite galaxy, we see perhaps a couple of dozen stars with more than a 100 solar masses, of which nine are in a tight core just a few light-years across,"" explained Prof Paul Crowther from Sheffield University, UK.
""But that two dozen number - that's probably more than are in the entire Milky Way Galaxy for this type of star,"" he told BBC News.
The observations are to be published shortly in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
They build on earlier work reported in 2010 that first described R136a1 - the most massive and most luminous star identified to date.
That study used data gathered principally by a ground-based telescope in Chile.
This follow-up research employed the pin-sharp resolution and ultraviolet sensitivity of the orbiting Hubble telescope to tease out yet more detail.
In 2010, astronomers saw four monster stars including R136a1 in the central core. Thanks to Hubble, they detect a further five.
The stars are not only extremely massive, but they are also extremely bright. Together, these nine stars outshine our Sun by a factor of 30 million, said Prof Crowther.
""Because they are so massive, they are all close to their so-called Eddington limit, which is the maximum luminosity a star can have before it rips itself apart; and so they've got really powerful outflows. They are shedding mass at a fair rate of knots,"" the astronomer added - up to an Earth mass of gaseous material per month.
The question is why this tight corner of space, located in the Tarantula Nebula of the LMC, harbours so many giants.
Prof Crowther thinks it is because the gas and dust in the region has become compressed as the Large Magellanic Cloud has skirted the edge of the Milky Way. One thing is for sure - none of these monster stars will be around for more than a few million years. To burn so bright is to burn briefly.
""A lot of these stars will be in binaries (in pairs), and when they die they'll produce black holes, which will merge at some point in the dim and distant future. And when they do they'll produce gravitational waves.
""The first detection of gravitational waves [reported by Advanced LIGO last month] was from the merger of a pair of 30-solar-mass black holes. They probably came from 100-solar-mass stars.""

333,"Towell, 25, was knocked down twice during the bout in Glasgow on Thursday and died in hospital on Friday night.
His partner Chloe Ross revealed he had been suffering migraines for weeks but had dismissed it as pre-match stress.
Towell was taking part in a welterweight title eliminator against Welsh fighter Dale Evans
Many tributes have been paid to the young fighter from Dundee - known as ""Iron Mike"" - who is only the third professional boxer to die in the UK from apparently fight-related injuries in 21 years.
He passed away with his family at his bedside at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
In a Facebook post, his partner Ms Ross said he had suffered brain damage but ""fought right to the end"", surviving for 12 hours after life support was turned off.
""I'm absolutely heartbroken to say my annoying best friend passed away tonight at 11.02 very peacefully,"" she wrote.
""Michael had severe bleeding and swelling to his brain.
""He had been complaining of headaches for the last few weeks but we put it down to migraines with the stress of his fight.
""It has been the longest 24 hours of our lives. My baby has lost his daddy. But he will be so so proud of his dad in what he achieved.""
Ms Ross added: ""Once he was taken off of his life support he managed 12 hours, 12 whole rounds off his life support, he fought right to the end and he's done us all so proud... He left doing the thing he's best at... there's only one.""
The St Andrew's Sporting Club fight took place at Glasgow's Radisson Blu Hotel on Thursday evening.
Towell was knocked down in the first round of the fight before recovering to continue the match.
Referee Victor Loughlin stopped the fight in the fifth round shortly after Towell was knocked down by Carmarthen fighter Evans for a second time.
He received treatment in the ring and was given oxygen before being taken to an ambulance on a stretcher.
A spokesman for St Andrew's Sporting Club later said that Towell's management team was not aware of any headache problems leading up to the fight.
Spencer Oliver, the former European Super Bantamweight champion who was placed in a coma after being injured in a fight in 1998, said Towell would not have been allowed to fight if there had been doubts about his health.
He said: ""He would have to have had all his medical tests. He was in a British title eliminator so all his brain scans would have been up to date and everything would have been in place with Mike going into that contest.""
But boxing promoter Frank Warren raised concerns about the reports that Towell had been suffering from headaches.
He said: ""If that's true, obviously he shouldn't have been fighting.  And I'm quite sure, the doctor, who examines the boxers and the medicals, if they had of known that, they would not have allowed him to box.
""So, obviously once the British Boxing Board of Control complete their investigation into the matter, they'll be able to give further comment on that.""
Boxing tragedies
Towell's family were joined by his manager, Tommy Gilmour, during his final hours.
Mr Gilmour said: ""He was Iron Mike to the end, he kept fighting till the last, and we have lost an exciting boxer but, more importantly, a very special man.
""I am devastated and all my thoughts are with Mike's mum Tracey, his partner Chloe and their little son Rocco.""
Many well known figures in boxing paid tribute to Towell.
Professional boxer turned promoter Ricky Hatton set up a JustGiving page to raise Â£20,000 to support Towell's family.
Trainer Shane McGuigan said on Twitter: ""Heartbreaking news that Mike Towell has lost his life. May he rest in peace, thoughts go out to his loved ones. #RIP""
Promoter Eddie Hearn tweeted: ""Absolutely devastated by the passing of Mike Towell - all of our thoughts with his friends and family at this time.""
The boxer had been undefeated going into Thursday's fight, with 11 previous wins and one draw on his professional record.
Veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn described Mike Towell's death as ""a terrible tragedy"" and renewed his call for blows to the head to be banned in sport.
The shadow cabinet member twice called for the rule change through private member's bills in 1998 and and 2005 but failed on both occasions.
Mr Flynn said: ""I think the consciences of people in the sport are aroused by tragedies of this kind and I think people should be aware of the dangers.

Residents say the militants drove into the towns and began shooting, looting and burning houses.
In a separate attack, a young female suicide bomber reportedly killed at least 10 people in the neighbouring state of Yobe.
A witness said the girl, who detonated explosives in the town of Gujba on Tuesday, was about 12 years old.
The Islamist group has not commented on the attack but it is known for carrying out such bombings.
Earlier this year, the Nigerian army seized Gujba from the militant group Boko Haram.
Some 18,000 people have been killed in Nigeria since the group began a campaign of violence in 2009.
One resident who fled Debiro Hawul said that the attack had taken the village by surprise.
""It never occurred to us we would be the next target,"" Umaru Markus told the AFP news agency.
""The gunmen slaughtered 22 people who were not fast enough in fleeing and went about looting homes, grains silos and drug stores,"" he added.
Tuesday's attack in Gujba happened at about 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT).
""It was a suicide attack by a girl of around 12 years,"" said witness Hussaini Aisami.
""She went into the market and headed straight to the grain section. She detonated her explosives in the middle of traders and customers.""
That attack came a day after two female suicide bombers attacked the north-eastern city of Maiduguri, killing at least 20 people.
And in January, at least 19 people were killed by a bomb strapped to a girl aged about 10 in Maiduguri.

It is the sector's longest period of falling sentiment since 2009 - in the midst of the financial crisis.
The survey of 115 companies found low interest rates and potential restricted EU market access were seen as risks.
But while 28% of the respondents were gloomier, 15% were more optimistic.
And almost 40% of the firms surveyed reported healthy profits in the last quarter.
Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, blamed the dip in sentiment on the ""uncertainty caused by Brexit to low interest rates, technological change and strong competition"".
She called on the chancellor Philip Hammond to ""set a clear direction for growth and prosperity"" in his Autumn Statement in November.
""With firms voicing strong concerns about the impact of Brexit, especially the risks to the wider economy in the years ahead, the government must allay their unease with clear plans for negotiations to leave the EU,"" Ms Newton-Smith added.

Care Fertility, which operates 15 clinics across Britain and supports fertility services in Hartlepool, said in January it was ""disappointed not to be awarded the contract"".

339,"Hamilton's Ali Crawford passed up a golden opportunity when he fired over when played through by Alex D'Acol.
That miss proved costly when Danny Swanson's corner was headed into the net by Cummins.
Cummins tapped in Blair Alston's low ball before Murray Davidson headed in Brian Easton's cross.
Media playback is not supported on this device
It was symbolic of the nature of this game that one of its most refined figures mislaid his composure. Crawford tends to be at the heart of Hamilton's best work, but this was a game that left him grimacing in frustration.
He swept a first-half free kick onto the roof of the net, but it was after the interval that he truly stood out. Sent clear through on goal by D'Acol, the midfielder sliced his shot wide from inside the area.
Hamilton manager Martin Canning stood with his head in his hands. There had been other occasions for regret, with Darian MacKinnon's shot from 20 yards beaten away early on and Craig Watson failing to hit the target from 16 yards out just before half-time. The worst was yet to come, though.
St Johnstone were always at their most threatening when the ball was in the air, either through Cummins and Steven MacLean in open play or through Steven Anderson and Joe Shaughnessy at set-pieces.
Moments after Crawford's miss, St Johnstone worked the ball up field and earned a corner that Swanson swung into the penalty area. Despite plenty of practise during the game, the Hamilton defenders weren't able to cope with this delivery, and Cummins leapt to head the ball past the goalkeeper Gary Woods.
Cummins was not finished, and five minutes later he was on hand to convert Alston's cross to further reward St Johnstone's dogged display. Sometimes, a win just has to be ground out, and the home side completed their scoring when Davidson's header from Easton's cross bounced off the post and rolled behind the goal-line.
This was a game that lacked drama and intensity, and even a moment of controversy failed to assert itself. When the Hamilton defender Dan Seaborne slid to stop the ball from going out for a corner, he appeared to handle it twice.
Yet none of the St Johnstone players in attendance, or any of the match officials, spotted the contact, so no penalty claim was made. Relief for Seaborne, and little consequence in the end since St Johnstone went on to win the game.
It was that kind of day for the visitors. Once St Johnstone had established their lead, Crawford sent one free-kick straight at home goalkeeper Zander Clark, then another just wide of the upright.
St Johnstone manager Tommy Wright: ""We'll play better and lose, but we got the job done. We upped the tempo in the second half and looked more like ourselves. It was a comfortable win but not a comfortable game.
""[Finishing in the top four] will be the aim. We're level with Hearts now, so we've got to see if we can finish off the season better than them.
""We've tried [to make new signings], but we're in a strong position in the league and the main concern is targeting for next season and keeping ones here. There might be something happens, the chairman does like a last-minute one, and if someone comes out who we think is better than what we've got then we'll do some business.  I'm more than comfortable to go with what I've got for the rest of the season.""
Hamilton manager Martin Canning: ""I've talked about key moments before and there's none more key than [Ali Crawford's miss at 0-0]. When you're through one-on-one, you've got to put the ball in the back of the net. Had we gone 1-0 up, it would have been a deserved lead, we were the better team up until that point.
""We are playing well, and we played particularly well at times today, but we've got to win games. It doesn't matter how we win, we need to become a different team, maybe not so pleasing in terms of knocking the ball about.
""Hopefully we can get one [player] in before Tuesday. It's not easy and we're trying hard to bring players in. We've got a bad run of injuries just now as well, five or six guys out who would be starting or coming on to have an influence. We're stretched, but that doesn't excuse defending like that.""

Cornwall businesswoman Melanie Evans said she was ""absolutely delighted"" at the result.
""The EU money has been spent unwisely in places on projects that have gone bankrupt and we now have the opportunity to take control of that funding,"" she said.
""We are in a deprived status and we have remained in deprived status even though that funding was coming in so it shows it hasn't worked.""
The people of Cornwall have voted to leave the EU - proof perhaps that money can't buy love.
While Britain as a whole has paid to be part of the EU, Cornwall is in the unusual position of being a net beneficiary.
Despite the huge investment in projects like the Combined Universities in Penryn, the Eden Project and Cornwall Airport Newquay, along with Superfast broadband - many people simply do not think they have felt any benefit.
And some say the fact that Cornwall still qualifies for this extra funding is an indication it hasn't sparked the growth intended.
Remain campaigners have warned Cornwall has always fared badly from Westminster and are not confident of future support of the scale seen from the EU.
But with five out of six Cornish MP's backing Leave during this campaign perhaps this vote here isn't surprising.
Eric Nicholls, Chairman of Cornwall Manufacturers' Group, said: ""Whether Cornwall will continue to receive its EU funding is far from certain, as are the pledges from the Remain side that this would be met from central government.""
Sarah Newton, Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth, who voted Remain, said she wanted to ""make sure the money gets into Cornwall so we can carry on making progress in getting well-paid jobs"".
Cllr Tim Dwelly, leader of the Labour Group at Cornwall Council, said: ""This is a disaster for Cornwall. Years of special EU funding for Cornwall are going to end.
""That funding has given us fibre broadband, a university, superb sixth form colleges, dual carriageways, airport investment, rail improvement, support for farmers and all kinds of business.""
Chris Pomfret, former Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Local Enterprise Partnership chairman, and now chairman of governors at Falmouth University said: ""I'm worried there will be turmoil that could go on for years.""
William Arnold tweeted: ""It's Ok though we can carry on being serfs in a theme park for second home owners and their children.""
A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ""It is important to understand that there will be no immediate changes.
""We must now prepare for a negotiation to exit the EU that will ensure the interests of all parts of the United Kingdom are protected and advanced.""","The government must replace the millions of pounds of EU support Cornwall may lose from Brexit with investment, its council leader says.",36616955,"Cornwall, a region in the UK that has received significant funding from the EU over the past 15 years, has voted to leave the EU, with some expressing concerns about the future of this funding and the impact on the local economy.",0,"Article: {}

342,"The tech companies will help design the subsea cable which will run between Virginia in the US and Bilbao, Spain.
The project will be managed by Spanish telecommunications firm Telefonica, which will sell any unused capacity on the cable to other customers.
The cable will help the tech giants move data more quickly and cheaply between their global data centres.
Tech companies typically have to pay telecommunications firms to use their cables, which can be costly. And the large amounts of data moving across those lines can make them slower.
The project, called MAREA, will be the highest-capacity sub-sea cable across the Atlantic, with an expected capacity of some 160 terabits per second of data, the companies said.
It is not the first subsea cable to be sponsored by a tech company.
In 2014 Google paired up with five telecommunications firms to build a subsea cable across the Pacific Ocean.
Construction of the 6,600km (4,125 miles) long cable is due to start in August and is scheduled to be completed in October 2017.
Microsoft said MAREA will help boost the speed and reliability of its cloud services.
""This marks an important new step in building the next generation infrastructure of the internet,"" said Microsoft's director of global network acquisition, Frank Rey.
Microsoft has also been testing underwater data centres. These centres would be cheaper to maintain because they would not have the associated cooling costs of data centres on land and could be powered through marine energy.

A number of roads remain closed due to flooding and fallen trees.
Gareth Bell, whose shoe shop was one of 31 units affected by flooding at the Linen Green complex, said there were ""a lot of people in disbelief"".
""As retailers, it's hard to fathom just how much it can ruin things over Christmas for everybody,"" he said.
Rivers Agency chief executive David Porter said the flooding was caused by a blocked culvert grille that caused the water to overflow.
He said the grille had been cleaned on Friday as part of weekly maintenance checks, but the sheer amount of rainfall brought down debris to block it.
""We were just hit by nature and a very significant rainstorm, although I would say that what we have seen, particularly in the west of the province, is a very good multi-agency approach to dealing with the flooding,"" he said.
The Fire and Rescue Service said it dealt with 31 flooding incidents. Most of those rescued were in vehicles that had become stranded in flood waters.
In one incident in Strabane, County Tyrone, 10 people were rescued from flooded properties at a housing development.

347,"Symantec says the Wifatch program is closing loopholes and fixing bugs on routers it infects.
Routers are being increasingly targeted by criminals keen to steal data or to help with large-scale web attacks.
Symantec has monitored the network of ""vaccinated"" devices but, so far, has not seen it put to malicious use.
Wifatch was first discovered in late 2014 and since then has been steadily scouring the web for routers and other smart devices running vulnerable software.
In a blogpost, Symantec said that once Wifatch finds and infects a vulnerable router it connects to other compromised devices to download software updates that make them harder to attack successfully.
In addition, it said, Wifatch tries to disinfect devices that have been compromised by malicious software. It regularly reboots devices to kill off malware running on them and return them to a clean state.
As far as Symantec can tell, Wifatch's payload has no malicious components and the growing network of compromised devices has never been used for attacks, said Symantec security analyst Mario Ballano.
The software also leaves a message on the router telling its owner to change the default passwords and update the firmware that controls the device.
Wifatch targets a wide variety of home routers that run variations of the Linux operating system. Symantec said that ""tens of thousands"" of gadgets were harbouring Wifatch. About a third of all the devices it had hit were in China with Brazil and Mexico making up another quarter of its victims.
Symantec remained cautious about the intentions of Wifatch despite its benign appearance.
""Wifatch is a piece of code that infects a device without user consent and, in that regard, is the same as any other piece of malware,"" said Mr Ballano.
""It should also be pointed out that Wifatch contains a number of general-purpose back doors that can be used by the author to carry out potentially malicious actions,"" he added.","A benevolent virus has been used to harden more than 10,000 home routers against cyber-attacks, says a security firm.",34423414,"Symantec has discovered a program called Wifatch that targets home routers with vulnerable software and infects them to download software updates and disinfect malware, but the company remains cautious about the program's intentions despite its benign appearance and lack of malicious payloads.",0,"Article: {}

This time it was Miles Storey who provided the cross from the left with Hughes getting across his marker to glance a header that the visiting goalkeeper grabbed gratefully.
Storey himself should have done better when Motherwell were again opened up down the same flank in first-half stoppage time but he could only direct Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo's cross wide from close range.

These men and women show off their favourite finds, and discuss the joys of mudlarking.
Dave Hiddleston, Limehouse
Long fascinated by history and collecting, Dave first discovered mudlarking while he was working on Cannon Street and saw people on the foreshore in wellington boots.
His favourite find is an English community cloth seal, which he believes was used to stamp cloth bags coming through London in about 1618.   It was inside a lump of burnt cinder.
Dave said: ""I am always encouraging others to go mudlarking. It is a great escape from the humdrum of modern life, and interesting doing research on your finds.
""Plus you get to meet some really interesting like-minded people.""

Ted discovered mudlarking by chance. ""I was walking along South Bank,"" he said, ""and I just hopped over a gate and came down to the foreshore. You get a sense of quietude and the perspectives on the city are so different, just by that small change of level.""
He then noticed the objects at his feet, such as this pipe stem shaped like a horse's hoof. He said: ""I have finds that are older and perhaps more beautiful, but this is the one that set it all off.
""It's absolutely beautiful. To hold it and know that someone else was smoking it 150 to 200 years ago is amazing.""
Ted believes that London's beauty lies in the fact that it hasn't all been embanked, and its tides allow these things to be found on the beaches: ""It churns up discoveries every day. Every tide there are new things to be found.""
The one item he is holding out for is a Bartmann jug, decorated stoneware from Germany that was used to transport food, drink and goods. For Ted, ""they inspire thoughts of darkly forested mountains"".
Andrea Smith, Rotherhithe
Although she began only in October last year, Andrea makes time to go to the shore up to six times a week. She uses a metal detector, alongside her eyes and a trowel, to find shards of pottery such as this, painted with a willow pattern.
Andrea said: ""It does not happen often that a shard contains both doves.
""I have found great joy, serenity and peace with my soulmate and best friend, my husband Iain.  This shard represents this to me.""

It's the unexpectedness of mudlarking that drew Sara to it, in contrast to the routine of London life.
""I feel the excitement when I'm walking along the bank,"" she said. ""It's a way of making order out of chaos.""
Sara has managed to find a piece of Bartmann jug, which - from the splashes of cobalt blue glaze - she has dated to 1600-20, made in Frechen.
She said: ""The face that was impressed on the neck of these jugs is a prized find from all mudlarkers - everyone wants to find one!""

His favourite find is a potted ham jar lid, which despite being only Victorian, is very rare as it is intact.

353,"Yet in this election, it is way down the list of priorities for most political parties.
Philip Hammond, himself a former defence secretary, has been reported as saying recently that ""there are no votes in defence"".
He does not recognise the quote, but the sentiment is largely borne out by the opinion polls which show defence just scrapes into the top 10 of electorate concerns, way behind the economy, the NHS and immigration.
UK military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya may have also contributed to a sense of combat fatigue among the public and a reticence by politicians to focus on the subject.
James de Waal, a senior fellow at independent think tank Chatham House, says in this campaign, politicians have been ""on the defensive on defence"".
This election issue includes foreign policy and the role of UK’s defence forces at home and abroad.
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
To find out Labour and Conservative policies on the subject you will have to persevere to page 77 of both their manifestos.
Even then they are pretty short on detail and do not really address the difficult decisions the next government is likely to face.
So to help, here is a guide to some of the more sensitive issues being left out.
Most analysts, and politicians, agree the world is becoming more dangerous and unstable, whether that is shown by thousands of migrants fleeing so-called failed states, the threat from Islamic extremism, or a more belligerent Russia.
Yet at the same time, most European nations, including the UK, have been making significant cuts to their armed forces.
The size of the UK's regular Army is being reduced from 102,000 to 82,000.
You could fit that number in Wembley Stadium and still have seats to spare.
The Royal Navy now has a fleet of just 19 warships, while the RAF has been left with eight - soon to be seven - front-line fast jet squadrons.
There are some things the UK military can no longer do - so-called capability gaps.
The UK has no Maritime Patrol Aircraft. It has to rely on its Nato allies to hunt for Russian submarines near or in its waters.
At the start of the last parliament, David Cameron could boast that the UK was the fourth biggest spender on defence in the world.
Now, according to the Stockholm International Research Institute, the UK has fallen to sixth place, behind the US, China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and France.
A commitment to spend 2% of the nation's wealth, or GDP, on defence is conspicuous by its absence.
Only two smaller parties - UKIP and the Democratic Unionist Party - say they would continue to meet that goal.
But all the indications suggest the UK will soon fall below the Nato threshold.
Malcolm Chalmers, of the defence think tank Royal United Services Institute, says on current projections, UK defence spending will fall to 1.7% by the end of the decade.
If there are more cuts it could fall to 1.5%.
He calculates that defence would require another £25bn over the next five years to stay above 2%.
The military top brass know that is not going to happen.
Their planning assumptions are based on flat spending plus an annual increase of 1% in the equipment budget.
Spending 2% is not mandatory to Nato membership.
Few states do, but it is totemic.
The US will inevitably think less of a key ally that no longer lives up to that commitment, especially when David Cameron recently lectured others on the need to increase defence spending at the Nato summit in Wales.
In US eyes, the UK's credibility will inevitably suffer if, as seems likely, it fails to meet the 2% target.
It is more than likely that any future government will have to make more cuts in defence.
The question is by how much?
Over the lifetime of the last parliament, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) cut its budget by about 8%.
With the Conservatives, Labour, and the Lib Dems promising to bring down the budget deficit, there will have to be more savings in public spending.
None of these three parties say they would ring-fence or protect defence, like the NHS or overseas aid.
The MoD has reason to be nervous - it has the second largest non-protected budget, after welfare, of £34bn a year.
Another Conservative-led government plans to make savings of around £12bn a year.
Shared across the board that could mean the MoD losing at least another  £2bn-£3bn of its annual budget.
But Michael Clark, director of defence think tank Rusi, says most of the political parties appear to be backing away from further big cuts, in part because UKIP has made defence an issue during the campaign.
The Conservatives also appear to have limited their options.
They are promising to replace Trident, to increase the defence equipment budget by 1% a year, and to make no further cuts to the size of the regular army.
Mr Clark says those commitments will make it hard to find ""significant savings"" in defence.
But without raiding the MoD's coffers, he says, the Conservatives' entire fiscal plans would ""go out of the window"".
Labour has been careful to avoid making similar commitments.
Military chiefs, though, are still worried.
Gen Sir Richard Shirreff, who was the second most senior military commander at Nato, says: "" I fear it's almost certain that there will be more cuts.""
The Conservatives and UKIP are committed to renewing Britain's nuclear deterrent with a like-for-like replacement.
That means building four new submarines at an estimated cost of at least £20bn.
According to the MoD's own figures, about one quarter of committed defence equipment spending over the next decade will be on the successor submarines and deterrent systems.
So it is an obvious area to look for savings.
Labour say they would continue the round-the-clock patrols, known as Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD), but will look at whether that can be done with three rather than four submarines.
The Liberal Democrats say they would retain a nuclear deterrent, but end CASD - what has been dubbed a ""part-time deterrent"".
The SNP and the Greens would scrap it altogether.
There is no political consensus.
James de Waal, who worked in the MoD on the last Strategic Defence Review says: ""Trident might be up for grabs.""
It is worth remembering the Tories went into the last election committed to renewing Trident, but as part of the coalition deal with the Liberal Democrats, postponed the decision.
What is to prevent another review and another delay, especially if a party like the SNP holds the balance of power?
Paul Ingram, who heads the British American Security Information Council, says the nuclear programme will have to be included in the next Strategic Defence Review, due after the election.
Not least because he says the US will find it hard to stomach a key ally spending all that money on the nuclear programme, if it means contemplating further cuts to the UK's conventional forces.
By the end of this decade, after a gap of 10 years, the UK will have two new operational aircraft carriers.
The Queen Elizabeth and the Prince of Wales will be the largest warships ever built for the Royal Navy.
They should be a symbol of power and of global ambition.
But there is a danger that they will be more like the emperor's new clothes.
On current manning levels, the Royal Navy will struggle to crew both carriers, even if as planned only one of them is operational at any given time.
Plans to equip them with the new F-35 jet, have already had to be scaled down.
There is space on board for 36 F-35s, but current plans are to sail with just 12.
The current chief of the defence staff, Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton, has already warned of the dangers of a ""hollow force"" with ""exquisite equipment"" but not enough people.

The inquest in Abergele, Conwy county, heard Mr Owen, 24, suffered cardiac arrest as a result of taking the drug. He was found to have ""toxic"" levels of cocaine in his body.
He collapsed shortly after being held by members of the public because he was kicking cars as he made his way along Farm Road.
Police were called and Mr Owen was handcuffed but officers noticed almost immediately he had no pulse and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.
The inquest focused on the attitude of the officers towards him.
Officers had also been called to other incidents in the days before Mr Owen's death including the one where the Taser was used.
The jury was told of concerns that more was not done to respond to his mental state and questions were raised about whether he was treated appropriately given the behaviour he was demonstrating.
The IPCC investigation looked at a number of complaints from Mr Owen's family about the police handling of the incidents.
It found where police used force, including deploying the Taser, it was necessary and appropriate.
It added police had taken steps to assist Mr Owen's welfare and to protect others and tried along with a member of the public to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived.
IPCC Commissioner Jan Williams said: ""Ultimately this was a very sad series of incidents.

Westwood, meanwhile, carded seven birdies and just one bogey in his 66.
The 43-year-old Englishman found out earlier this week he would not be competing in the World Cup in Melbourne next week.
Westwood's partner Danny Willett pulled out because of a back problem, and his place went to Chris Wood.
Under tournament rules, Wood was able to select his own partner and opted for Andy Sullivan.
""I'm disappointed not to be playing,"" said Westwood.
""I can understand him picking a mate and he has picked a very good player. It is probably more to do with the rules than anything.""
The Tour Championship is the final event of the Race to Dubai, with four players still in with a chance of topping the European Tour Order of Merit.
Henrik Stenson, holder of a course-record 25 under at the Earth Course, leads but Willett can leapfrog the Swede should he win the tournament.
Willett would also top the list if he finishes second and neither Stenson nor Alex Noren win in Dubai.

McIlroy has an outside chance which requires several permutations falling into place - including Stenson finishing no higher than 46th in the 60-man field.

363,"Richard McAuley, 42, from Townhill Road in Portglenone pleaded guilty to the murder of Denise Dunlop, aged 32.
The fatal stabbing occurred in the living room of Ms Dunlop's Centuripe Avenue home in Ballymena last June.
The court heard that as a result of the attack, the couple's daughter suffered a ""complex and traumatic experience"".
McAuley was told by the judge, Mr Justice Weir, that he had caused ""enormous and permanent harm"" to his daughter.
The court heard that prior to the attack, on the evening of 14  June,  Ms Dunlop and McAuley had gone to her father's house.
As they made their way back home in a taxi accompanied by Ms Dunlop's step-mother, the taxi stopped at an off-licence where alcohol was bought.
When the taxi arrived back at Centuripe Avenue, Ms Dunlop's seven-year old daughter returned home from the babysitter's and they watched football on the TV.
A row between the couple then broke out - possibly over an ice cream that was given to the girl - which resulted in what Mr Justice Weir described as ""mutual pushing and pulling"".
As Ms Dunlop sat on the sofa, McAuley went to the kitchen where he armed himself with a knife.
He returned to the living room, where he stabbed his partner three times in the upper body in front of their daughter and Ms Dunlop's step-mother.
A wound to her chest, which passed through her left lung and heart, proved to be the fatal injury.
Mr Justice Weir said the killing was ""senseless"" and told McAuley his actions had deprived a young girl of her mother.
Saying the row was ""fuelled by drink and drugs"", the judge said a young woman had died in a row which was ""almost unbelievable in its triviality"".
Since murdering Ms Dunlop, the court heard McAuley had made the case that he acted as he did due to provocation.
However, the judge said that while he accepted the couple's 13-year relationship was on and off - largely due to McAuley's substance abuse - there was no history of violence between the couple, and there was ""no justification"" for McAuley's actions.
Mr Justice Weir told McAuley: ""You are a powerfully built man of six feet one, while the deceased was a foot shorter. There was no excuse for bringing a knife into this silly domestic dispute.
""The deceased was very drunk, and the prescription drugs she had taken would have made her intoxication worse. She was no threat to you.""

364,"The development could be the starting point for breeding a strain of ash to replace thousands expected to succumb to ash die-back in the next few years.
Ash die-back is now established and spreading within Britain
Researchers are hoping that genetics might yield the knowledge to fight back.
A joint project by the John Innes Centre, the Genome Analysis Centre and the Sainsbury Laboratory  - all based in Norwich - has reached this milestone just two months after receiving the samples.
Dr Mario Caccamo of the Genome Analysis Centre said: ""Speed is important to the research so that all those studying the epidemic can start to look for clues to tackle it.""
And they do mean everyone.
All the data is being put on a crowd sourcing website OpenAshDieBack to enable experts from around the world to help identify genes that might be connected to the trees' ability to withstand the fungus.
These genes could then be part of a breeding programme for resistant trees.
The samples for the latest research came from so-called ""tree 35"", a strain of ash from Denmark originally bred nearly 100 years ago, which has shown an ability to tolerate the fungal disease, when virtually all its Danish relatives were wiped out.
But just planting this variety in the UK would leave us with a narrow genetic base vulnerable to future diseases and not ideally suited to British growing conditions.
Prof  Allan Downie of the John Innes Centre believes this genetic understanding of both the lethal fungal infection and the surviving strain could help fill the impending gap in the canopy.
""We're trying to give nature a bit of a helping hand by identifying the right kind of (native) trees to do the appropriate crosses,"" he said.
""It would be wonderful to be part of the solution but the problem is enormous and the breeding is going to take a long time.""
In March, a related team sequenced the genome of the fungus that causes die-back.
The firm grip of this disease is evident in many of East Anglia's woodlands.
While filming with Countryfile in Suffolk, Paul Beales from Fera, the government's Food and Environment Research Agency, set up a search for the Chalara fraxinea fungus itself.
The symptoms of the disease were plain to see in scars on the trunk and skeletal canopies, but the source of the infection - the sporulating fungus - had not been found in Britain.
After half an hour on hands and knees in the leaf litter and some identification first by magnifying glass and then by genetic analyser, that all changed.
Paul Beales said: ""We've just got the sporing stage of this particular fungus picked up from the ground which has never been found in the UK before.  ""This is a first. It's here to stay.""
If that is true, breeding a tree which can survive alongside it is more crucial than ever.

He made the request in relation to an email about the 2012 attacks on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.
But the FBI said it did not change the classification level.
The email in question described reports in November 2012 that Libyan police were arresting suspects in the attack of two months earlier, which left Ambassador Christopher Stephens and three other Americans dead.
Other interesting revelations from the newly released FBI documents include:
The 100-page FBI document published on Monday says an unnamed FBI official was ""pressured"" in summer last year to change the classified Clinton email to unclassified.
The official said he had received a call from a colleague - whose name is also redacted - at the FBI's International Operations Division.
The colleague said he had been contacted by Mr Kennedy asking him to change the email's classification level in ""exchange for a 'quid pro quo'"".
The State Department, the FBI document says, offered to ""reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden"".
Mr Kennedy, according to the FBI documents, followed up on this matter at a subsequent meeting, spending 15 minutes attempting to influence the FBI to unclassify the Clinton email.
He also pressed FBI assistant director of counterterrorism Michael Steinbach on the issue.
Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said the revelation ""bears all the signs of a cover-up"".
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted: ""Unbelievable.""
Mr Kennedy, who has spent more than four decades at the State Department, was already a lightning rod for Republican criticism.
He oversaw both diplomatic security during the 2012 attacks in Benghazi and the records and IT departments during Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server.
But State Department Deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied any wrongdoing by Mr Kennedy.
""Under Secretary Kennedy sought to understand the FBI's process for withholding certain information from public release,"" Mr Toner said.
""As has been reported, there have been discussions within the interagency on issues of classification.""
The email in question was among some 100 messages recovered from Mrs Clinton's private email server that the FBI would ultimately designate as classified.
The FBI and State Department engaged in a review of the former secretary of state's emails as they were being made ready for public release.
FBI Director James Comey concluded in his investigation Mrs Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in handling the classified material.

Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for the home side when he failed to score from the penalty spot.
St Mirren now lead Group G by three points.
It might have been picture postcard weather for the first half in Paisley, but there wasn't much to write home about.
St Mirren were too predictable with long balls floated forward for John Sutton and David Clarkson up front, although Mallan's dead ball delivery was, as always, a threat.
Ayr started well enough and Paul Cairney had a real early chance, but after that Saints looked comfortable at the back.
St Mirren's best chance of the half fell for Calum Gallacher who got on to the end of a lovely ball from Clarkson.
It was screaming for the first-time volley, but he chose the wrong option in taking a touch and the opportunity melted in the evening sun.
Things, we hoped, could only get better in the second half.
They did. A bit.
Lewis Morgan was highly impressive down the left side for the home team, embracing the concept of dazzling wing play and hitting the by-line before delivering the cross. But no-one could cash in.
He won his team a penalty with another dazzling run. The usually deadly Mallan took the spot kick, but United goalkeeper Greg Fleming produced a wonderful save to his right hand side to urge the game toward further penalties after 90 minutes.
But then central defender Baird chipped in with his last-minute effort, bundling the ball over the line after a scramble in the box.
Enough to set Saints proudly at the top of their section.
St Mirren manager Alex Rae: ""We struggled to get any intensity in the first half. I'm conscious of the fact it was really warm out there tonight.
""A lot of the boys are just not up to speed. This competition has come really early.
""Lewis Morgan tonight was sensational, driving at people. The boy is making a really big impact.
""I spoke to Stewart (Gilmour, the chairman) before the game, there may be funds for a loan deal, but we'll try and squeeze a few quid out of him.""
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: ""I thought it was a really poor game of football. We're a mile short in terms of bodies and fitness but a draw would have been fair. To lose one so late is hard to take.
""But, we've got two games left and if we win them two you never know.
""We need strikers. We need a wide player. We need a centre back. We're four or five short of where we want to be. The substitutes Alex (Rae) was able to make was the difference.""

370,"Ineos wants to conduct seismic surveys at Clumber Park in Nottinghamshire to see if there is potential for fracking.
The firm said the charity had blocked any contact for almost a year and it was considering seeking a court order.
The National Trust said it opposed any activities leading to the extraction of fossil fuels, so rejected requests.
Moves to look for shale gas in the Sherwood Forest area have proved controversial due to environmental concerns over extraction - known as fracking - and expansion of fossil fuel use.
Ineos said it already had permission from nearby landowners for the the non-invasive survey and its ability to extract gas would be ""significantly limited"" if it could not get on to Clumber Park.
""If the National Trust refuses to change its position, Ineos will have no choice but to write to the Oil and Gas Authority, asking for permission to seek a court order enforcing its rights to carry out these surveys on National Trust land,"" it said in a statement.
The company said government licences gave it a legal obligation to investigate shale gas deposits around the country and criticised the charity's position as ""overtly political"" as shale gas had lower carbon emissions than either oil and gas.
A National Trust spokesman said: ""The National Trust is opposed to fracking on its land and will reject any fracking requests or inquiries.

371,"The Sentencing Council also suggests judges could give longer sentences to offenders who film their victims.
In a new consultation, the body says judges should closely consider the complex and damaging effect that a crime has on a victim.
The proposed new guidelines cover virtually all sexual offences.
The Sentencing Council is responsible for trying to ensure consistency in criminal sentencing across all courts in England and Wales and it draws up complex guidelines to assist judges.
The council said that its proposed guidelines for sexual offences aim to update the way the courts deal with 54 crimes, to take into account the tactics and technologies used by offenders, as well as the long-term damage done to a victim.
The guidelines cover almost every sexual offence that is recognised in the UK, from voyeurism to rape, and, if adopted, would play a key role in dealing with people convicted of historic allegations of sexual abuse when victims have come forward decades after the event.
In the 14-week consultation, the council said that judges should be able to send offenders to jail for longer where modern technology proves to be an aggravating factor in increasing the victim's suffering - such as filming abuse of a sexual assault and then distributing it to others.
Judges are concerned that they have seen a worrying increase in the number of cases where rapists have filmed their attack and the victim.
Previously the focus in sentencing has been largely on the physical act of the crime, such as which part of a body was violated, because the law defines each individual offence in a quite technical way.
The council's new guidelines make clear that this form of sentencing does not take sufficient account the potentially catastrophic long-term effect on the victim.
Under the new guidelines, judges would also be able to jail those guilty of so-called ""one-off"" rapes for a maximum of 19 years, a sentence that is currently only for offenders who attack more than once.
Judges can also take into account the behaviour of an offender before the specific offence, such as whether they use drugs and alcohol as part of their targeting.
Sentencing for sexual offences against children should also look at how the victim has been groomed or whether the assailant was in a position of trust.
Lord Justice Treacy of the council said: ""We're improving guidance for courts to help them deal with these incredibly complex, sensitive and serious offences.
""The perspective of victims is central to the council's considerations. We want to ensure sentences reflect everything the victim has been through and what the offender has done.
""We are looking at the whole context, not just the physical offence but also the tactics employed by offenders like grooming activity, the targeting of vulnerable victims or abuse of a position of trust.
""No one wants more people becoming victims, so protecting the public is a vital part of our proposals, whether this is by jailing offenders or through rigorous treatment to stop them reoffending.""
Psychological impact is already taken into consideration in assault and burglary guidelines, but Lord Justice Treacy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""current [sexual offence] guidelines don't concentrate enough on the perspective of victims"".
Sexual violence campaigner Jill Saward, who was raped by two burglars who broke into her home in Ealing, London, in 1986, welcomed the proposals.
""For too long, the impact that [sexual violence] has had on victims has  been neglected in the whole justice process,"" she said.
In the aftermath of her attack, she saw a psychotherapist, a psycho-analyst and psychiatrist, but that was not mentioned in court, she said.
At the sentencing of her attackers, Mr Justice Leonard said that her trauma ""had not been so great"" - a comment he was censured for and apologised for later in his life.
""That reflected how little understanding there was. I'd been suicidal three times, I'd had post-traumatic stress disorder, which wasn't really recognised then,"" she said.
She added that victims often felt a sense of responsibility to other potential victims, and were relieved when their rapist was locked up for a long time, thereby preventing further attacks.",Sentences for rapists and other sex offenders in England and Wales could become tougher to recognise the long-term psychological harm they cause.,20619590,"The Sentencing Council is proposing new guidelines for sentencing sexual offenders in England and Wales that prioritize the victim's perspective and take into account the long-term damage caused by the crime, including the use of modern technology to film and distribute the assault, and the potential for grooming and abuse of position of trust.",0,"Article: {}

Their Premier League title defence began with a shock 3-2 home defeat by Burnley on Saturday, during which Gary Cahill and Cesc Fabregas were sent off.
""The club are trying to do their best,"" said the Italian.
""I am not worried, I am ready to fight with these players.
""I repeat: It is important for us to concentrate on our work, to be focused every day in training and to try to work in our best way. No excuses.""
Media playback is not supported on this device
As well as defender Terry and midfielder Matic, Chelsea have sold Asmir Begovic to Bournemouth, while last season's top scorer Diego Costa has been told he is free to leave.
The recruitment of midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco, striker Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, defender Antonio Rudiger from Roma and former Manchester City keeper Willy Caballero fills the gaps vacated by this quartet.
But Conte has made no secret of his desire to recruit more players to strengthen his first team for a season that sees the addition of Champions League matches to their fixture list.
Having also sold Nathan Ake to Bournemouth and loaned fellow defender Kurt Zouma to Stoke, the suspension of Cahill will further deplete Conte's resources.
Equally, Fabregas' ban deprives him of another midfielder, with Bakayoko, Hazard and Pedro all out injured.
Conte felt Cahill's dismissal was pivotal to the outcome of Saturday's game against Burnley, with Chelsea 3-0 down at the break following two goals from Sam Vokes and a Stephen Ward strike.
A debut goal from substitute Morata and a late David Luiz finish gave them hope, but Burnley held on for the win.
""The red card [for Cahill] was the key moment,"" Conte told BBC Sport. ""We started well with good intensity and were dominating the game. Then the game changed. We lost our heads too easily and we need to reflect on this situation.

""Expectancy grows on the team you're playing now. Statistics work in your favour over a season and mindset works in your favour because the pressure is on the opposition.""
I think most Burnley fans would rather see their side win this game than have beaten Lincoln in the FA Cup.

Mr Morales said he had ordered the move in honour of the Bolivian people fighting to regain control of their natural resources.
Last month Argentina took control of Spanish-owned oil company YPF.
Speaking at a May Day ceremony, President Morales said that ""in honour of all Bolivian people who have struggled to recuperate our natural resources and basic services, we are nationalising Transportadora de Electricidad (TDE)"".
'Failure to invest'
He said he was expropriating the company because it had failed to invest sufficiently in Bolivia.
Spanish power company REE bought 99.94% of shares in TDE in 2002. The remaining 0.06% are in the hands of the Bolivian employees of TDE.
TDE owns and runs 73% of the power lines in Bolivia, providing 85% of Bolivians with electricity, according to the company's website.

Spendiff, 26, was remanded in custody ahead of sentencing in July.
In CCTV footage shown to the High Court in Edinburgh, Mr Logie could be seen lying motionless on the ground after the assault.
Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC told the court: ""Witnesses speak to hearing the sound of a crack as the deceased's head hit the ground and he did not move thereafter.""
The construction manager suffered a brain injury and fracture to the back of his head following the attack at Friars Street on 7 August.
Spendiff, of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, admitted assaulting and killing Mr Logie by punching him on the head causing him to fall to the ground where he struck his head.
He also pled guilty to committing a breach of the peace along with Shaun McCarthy by conducting themselves in a disorderly manner and fighting with others.
Both also pled guilty to assaulting Paul Stubberfield and Stuart McKee in a taxi in Friars Street.
The court heard that Spendiff and McCarthy had gone out drinking for the evening after working together as technicians on wind turbines.
Mr Brown said that everyone appeared to be in good spirits, but a member of the stag party and another drinker then became involved in a heated argument.

The families, who say the men were ""massacred"", had their case rejected by the UK Court of Appeal last year.
British forces at the time of the killings said the men were insurgents.
In the Supreme Court panel's judgement, one of the justices, Lord Kerr, described the case as ""shocking"" and said the ""overwhelming preponderance of currently available evidence"" showed ""wholly innocent men were mercilessly murdered"".
He said it was ""with regret"" that he dismissed the appeal.
""This is an instance where the law has proved itself unable to respond positively to the demand that there be redress for the historical wrong that the appellants so passionately believe has been perpetrated on them and their relatives,"" Lord Kerr said.
""That may reflect a deficiency in our system of law. It certainly does not represent any discredit on the honourable crusade that the appellants have pursued.""
Another of the justices, Lady Hale, said she would have allowed the appeal and said the UK government ""did not seriously consider the most cost-effective form which such an inquiry might take"".
""They did not seriously consider the ""bigger picture"": the public interest in properly inquiring into an event of this magnitude; the private interests of the relatives and survivors in knowing the truth and seeing the reputations of their deceased relatives vindicated,"" she said.
The appellants in the case - Chong Nyok Keyu, Loh Ah Choi, Lim Kok and Wooi Kum Thai, two of whom were at Batang Kali as children - were supported by the action group Condemning The Batang Kali Massacre, a campaign in Malaysia that includes 568 civil society organisations.
Michael Fordham QC, representing the appellants, told the court that the families wished to ""vindicate the legitimate interests of the deceased, in order to achieve justice, before they die themselves"".
Relatives argued that Article 2 - the right to life - of the European Convention on Human Rights imposes a duty on the UK to commission an independent inquiry, despite the killings occurring before the convention was drafted and signed.
It was argued on behalf of the government that the Human Rights Act ""does not have retrospective effect and does not impose an obligation to hold an inquiry into deaths occurring several decades before it came into force"".
The account of the British authorities at the time was that the deceased were justifiably shot while they were attempting to escape from the patrol.
An official explanation was contained in a written parliamentary answer in Hansard, published on 26 January 1949.
On 11 and 12 December 1948 - when Malaya was still a British colony - 24 villagers were killed by a platoon of Scots Guards during a raid at Batang Kali.

It also lets the handhelds act as controllers for the firm's Internet Explorer web browser, which will launch on the console later this year.
The move poses a challenge to Nintendo's Wii U Game Pad.
While the Japanese company's product is specifically designed to enhance the experience of using its next-generation console, Microsoft is offering users a way to extend the functionality of its existing games machines via third-party devices they may already have.
""Xbox SmartGlass works with all the devices that you already own: the TV you already own, the phone you already own and the tablet you already own,"" said Marc Whitten, head of Microsoft's Xbox Live division.
""Xbox SmartGlass turns any TV into a smart TV.""
A demo showed the highly anticipated first-person shooter Halo 4 using the facility to trigger maps and other data about its in-game environment.
The announcement
 was made in Microsoft's keynote presentation at the E3 video games trade show in Los Angeles.
Mr Whitten added that SmartGlass would also enhance television programmes and films streamed through the Xbox.
He gave the example of a viewer watching Game of Thrones on their television and being able to look down at their tablets to see where on-screen characters were located on a map of the show's fantasy world.
The demonstration also showed how the linked device could bring up details about the cast and characters while the user was watching a film.
""It lets Microsoft say that you don't need to buy new hardware to have a two-screen experience,"" Stephen Totilo, editor of gaming website Kotaku, told the BBC.
""Nintendo looked to be ahead of everyone else on this, but now Microsoft is breathing down its neck. But there may be a little bit of smoke and mirrors here as I'm not convinced SmartGlass will have as much functionality as the Wii U offers.""
The app was also mocked by South Park's creator Trey Parker who was at the event to promote a new video game featuring his characters.
""How many times have you been watching an episode of South Park and thought I'd like to be able to watch this on my television while hooked into my mobile device which is being controlled by my tablet device which is hooked into my oven all while sitting in the refrigerator,"" he joked.
New uses for Microsoft's Kinect motion and voice sensor also featured heavily in the E3 presentation.
A tie-up with Nike
 will deliver a title towards the end of the year in which a digital personal trainer offers feedback on owners' workout techniques based on information gathered by the Kinect.
Voice commands were shown being used to change team formations in the next edition of the American Football simulation John Madden NFL, and to call in air strikes in the action game Splinter Cell Blacklist.
A new game called Wrecketer also allows players to use gestures to launch and guide missiles to destroy castles in a title based around a similar concept to Angry Birds.
Microsoft also promoted its device as an entertainment hub.
A new service called Xbox Music will offer ""over 30 million music tracks"" to the Xbox as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone devices.
A video suggested the service would rival similar offerings from Spotify, Rdio and others. However, details were scant with no launch date or countries mentioned, and no comment about how it would affect the firm's existing Zune product.
US users were promised new content including NBA basketball games, Paramount Pictures movies and Nickelodeon children's programmes.
Much of the rest of the presentation was dedicated to trailers showcasing new titles in existing video game franchises such as Tomb Raider, Fable, Call of Duty and Resident Evil.
""We're probably getting a new Xbox console in 2013 so that will be what the next E3 is about, so they had to spend this year talking about the stuff that precedes it,"" said Mr Totilo.

389,"They want England, Wales and Northern Ireland brought in line with Scotland.
The bill proposes amending the 1988 Road Traffic Act to lower the blood-alcohol concentration limit from 80mg alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg.
The government said the current limit struck a balance between safety and personal freedom.
The bill, which will be debated in the Lords on Friday, also proposes lowering the limits for alcohol in breath and urine when driving a vehicle.
Because everyone has a different susceptibility to alcohol, health experts say it is difficult to quantify exactly how many units can be drunk before reaching the proposed new limit.
For the average man, it would be just under a pint of beer or a large glass of wine and for women, half a pint of beer or a small glass of wine.
In a letter to the Times, the Alcohol Health Alliance said the move would save lives and improve road safety.
The alliance, which is made up of organisations including the Royal College of Physicians, the British Medical Association and Alcohol Concern, said that at the current limit, drivers are six times more likely to die in a road traffic accident than those who have not drunk any alcohol.
It said a vote in favour of the bill would signal to the government that ""now is the time time to lower the drink-driving limit"".
Scotland lowered its drink-driving limit to the proposed new level in December 2014 and police figures show that drink-drive offences there fell by 17% in the first three months of 2015.
Northern Ireland is currently consulting on whether to lower its limit.
At present, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have one of the highest drink-driving limits in Europe.
The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 50mg/100ml.
Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance and honorary professor in clinical science at the University of Liverpool, said the overriding reason for lowering the limit was that ""several hundreds of lives could be saved in England each year"".
And he said the scientific evidence for the change was strong.
""There is a wealth of published, peer-reviewed, high quality research on the impact of alcohol on psychomotor skills and judgement.
""While even low levels have an effect on these critical functions, the deterioration in performance moving from a blood level of 50 to 80mg per 100ml are striking.""
Prof Gilmore said there was public support for a lowering of the legal drink-drive limit at a time when drink-driving appears to be on the rise.
The Local Government Association recently estimated that lowering the current limit would also save nearly Â£300m a year by reducing police and ambulance call-outs and hospital admissions.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""The drink-driving limit for England and Wales strikes an important balance between safety and personal freedom.
""By having our limit, we are not criminalising those who drink a small amount a long time before driving, but our advice remains unchanged: don't take the risk by driving after you have had a drink.""

Freeing children to go out alone in their local area benefited their health and development, the researchers said.
Fear over traffic was the top reason for restricting freedom, they added.
The children and their parents were surveyed between 2010 and 2012 about what they were allowed to do in their local neighbourhoods without supervision.
This included:
The study said: ""A large proportion of children under 11 years old in most of the countries do not have the the freedom to get about their local area.
""Even the oldest children are restricted in what they are allowed to do, at an age when many of the rights of adulthood are close to being granted, including the right to drive vehicles on the road once the test has been passed.""
Overall, Finland was found to be the top-performing country on independent mobility, with Germany coming second.
According to the survey, most Finns can, without supervision:
In England, most primary school children are allowed to cross roads without supervision but only 28% to travel home from school and even fewer to go out after dark, travel on local buses or walk to places other than school.
Even at secondary school, less than 25% are allowed out alone after dark.
Ben Shaw, director of the Policy Studies Institute, said: ""Obviously, we've got to protect children but part of their development is that we allow them to gain independence.

Election officials have urged patience.
Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election.
He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge.
His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.
With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.
However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.
More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.
The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.
Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.
This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.

Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.
At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.
Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.
Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.
Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.
Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.
Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.
""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.
But the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.
If no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.
As there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.
In the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that ""choices have consequences"".
The winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.
If there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.

Mr Jones said Wales was ready to support the UK government in welcoming greater numbers of vulnerable children.
The Home Office said its priority was to ensure the safety of children in the Calais camp.
Mr Jones made the case in a joint statement with Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru; Mary Powell-Chandler, head of Save the Children in Wales; Huw Thomas, head of Christian Aid Wales, and Jim Barnaville, co-chair of Citizens Cymru Wales.
The statement said Mr Jones had written to the prime minister expressing ""our shared view that the UK government should take urgent action to resettle more unaccompanied refugee children in the UK and offering the support of Wales in welcoming them"".
With the French government set to demolish the Calais ""Jungle"" camp, the statement asked Mrs May to ""allow all those refugee children with a legal right to be in the UK into the country with the utmost urgency"".
""The children in the camp, some of whom have been as young as eight years old, have fled conflict and persecution and are now stuck in northern France, deeply traumatised and at considerable risk,"" the statement read.
""Every extra day we take places these children at greater risk.""
The Immigration Act included an amendment, originally put forward by Lord Dubs, that places a legal requirement on government to arrange for the transfer to the UK of unaccompanied refugee children from Europe.
The statement welcomed a commitment from the UK government to resettle children who have a legal right to be in the UK, but called on Ms May to do more, adding: ""Wales is ready to support the UK government in welcoming more vulnerable children as refugees via the Dubs amendment"".
The children's charity Unicef has appealed to the UK government to speed up the transfer of unaccompanied child refugees in Calais.
It has said it is concerned the planned closure of the camp will lead to children there disappearing before they are processed.
A Home Office spokesman said: ""Our priority must be to ensure the safety and security of the children in the Calais camp.""
He said that Home Secretary Amber Rudd had told the French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve that the UK government intended to transfer as many minors as possible eligible under the Dublin Regulation before the start of the clearance.
Under the Dublin Regulation, asylum seekers must make an initial asylum claim in the first EU state they reach, but can apply for asylum in other EU states if they have family there.

400,"Motorcycles used as taxis and known as boda bodas are time-savers for people who need to get somewhere in Tanzania's north-western city of Mwanza.
They seem to be the only way to beat traffic jams. But when you get on the bike and wrap your arms around the driver, you are actually putting your life in his hands.
In the first half of this year, there were more than 5,000 road accidents in Tanzania. More than a quarter of them were motorcycle accidents.
Boda boda drivers are often blamed for causing the problems on Mwanza's roads. They might get you where you want to go quickly, but they have a reputation for driving recklessly.
There are hundreds of them competing for fares, which increases the risk of accidents.
But that is also where trainee doctor Marko Hingi saw an opportunity to turn boda boda drivers into true life-savers.
He was inspired by the fact that wherever there is a medical emergency in Mwanza, there is likely to be a motorcycle taxi driver nearby.
""We have human beings here and we can use them as volunteers to help,"" says Mr Hingi, who works at a hospital in the city.
He is also head of the Tanzania Rural Health Movement, which recruits boda boda drivers and turns them into first-responders, acting like paramedics.
""In the past when somebody got injured, he bled while people looked at him until he died,"" says Anicet Mase, one of Mr Hingi's volunteer drivers.
Now Mr Mase zips around Mwanza wearing a fluorescent orange vest and a backpack full of bandages and other first-aid kit.
He and the other volunteer drivers have been trained in basic first-aid, such as keeping airways open, stopping bleeding and splinting fractured bones.
The drivers also have mobile phones and are linked to a system called Beacon.
Mwanza's fire station receives calls reporting emergencies.
A dispatcher enters the details into the Beacon software, which then sends a text message to everyone linked to the system.
If a motorcycle taxi driver is nearby, he can respond to the emergency.
""We've designed [the Beacon] to be used in countries that don't have the resources to implement a robust EMS [Emergency Medical Services] system,"" says Michael McGee, the East Africa representative of Trek Medics International, which developed Beacon and runs a similar programme in the Dominican Republic.
This ""robust"" service involves people calling for ambulances on emergency numbers such as 999, 112 or 911.
But this is expensive and does not exist in many poorer countries. It is up to the sick and injured to get to hospital any way they can.
When Mr Hingi was six he remembers his sick mother walking to hospital, worrying that wild dogs would attack her on the way.
That childhood memory inspired Mr Hingi's dream to become a doctor and bring ambulances to Mwanza.
""Communities are suffering because they lack a good system to help them,"" he says.
As for Mr Mase, he is driven by the idea that boda boda drivers are now given the opportunity to counter their bad reputation for putting lives at risk on the roads.
A big part of his work is to deal with injuries caused on the roads.
About 90% of the 1.25 million people killed every year in traffic accidents die in low and middle income countries.
However, there is a limit to what motorbike drivers can do to help.
Some of Tanzania's roads are in too bad a condition for them to reach patients and evacuate them safely.
So, even though the motorcycles in Mwanza find it easier to avoid potholes and wind through traffic, there is work to be done before boda boda drivers can really claim to be saving lives rather than putting them at risk.","Tanzania's motorcycle taxi drivers, often associated with deadly road accidents, are being trained to become life-savers, writes Ross Velton.",38018716,"In Mwanza, Tanzania, boda boda drivers, who are often blamed for causing traffic accidents, are being trained and equipped as first responders to provide basic medical care and transportation to emergency situations, in an effort to improve the city's emergency medical services and reduce the number of road accidents.",0,"Article: {}

Earlier, Bianchi's father Philippe had described the situation as ""desperate"".
""Every time the telephone goes, we know it could be the hospital to tell us that Jules is dead,"" he said.
""He will not give up, I'm sure of that. I can see it. I believe it.""
He added in an interview with Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport: ""I speak to him. I know he can hear me.
""His doctors have told us that this is already a miracle, no-one has ever survived such a serious accident. But Jules won't give up.
""His trainer Andrea says that if there is one person who can make it happen with his will, it's Jules.""
Philippe said the family had been touched by the show of support from other Formula 1 drivers, who gathered at the front of the grid before the Russian Grand Prix, arms around each other's shoulders, forming a 'circle of solidarity' for Jules.
""I've never seen anything like that,"" Philippe said. ""It touched us very deeply. We thank every one of them. So many of them have been in touch, written to me; [Fernando] Alonso, [Jean-Eric] Vergne, [Felipe] Massa have given strong messages.
""[Lewis] Hamilton wrote me a beautiful email in which he says that if there is anything he can do, he's there. [Valentino] Rossi and [Marc] Marquez from Moto GP too.""
Philippe also said he is using the accident of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who continues his recovery at home after suffering a head injury in a skiing accident in December, as a reference point.
""I was very sad when he got hurt,"" Philippe said. ""I kept wondering, like every one else 'Why don't they tell us more about how he is?'.
""But now I'm in the same position I understand. Everyone keeps asking me how Jules is but I can't reply, there is no answer. It's very serious but he's stable.

Barcelona made a voluntary tax payment of €13.5m in 2014 after being charged with tax fraud over the signing, but denied any wrongdoing.

404,"Researchers funded by the charity found that by looking at a specific group of genes they were able to reliably detect underlying problems.
It follows the death of Sir David Frost's son Miles, who died suddenly from a condition thought to have been inherited from his father.
His family aims to raise Â£1.5m to make genetic testing available in the UK.
The eldest son of the late presenter and broadcaster died last year, aged 31, when he was out jogging near his family's home in Oxfordshire.
He was suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Previous genetic tests looked at a small number of genes and were only able to identify specific conditions, leading to higher costs and longer diagnosis time - a major barrier to rolling the test out across the NHS.
But researchers from Imperial College London and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre say the new test, which looks at 174 genes, is quicker and more reliable.
It has already been rolled out at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust in London , with around 40 patients per month being successfully tested.
Dr James Ware, a consultant cardiologist specialising in inherited heart conditions, said: ""Without a genetic test we often have to keep the whole family under regular surveillance for many years. This is hugely costly for both the families and the health system.
""By contrast, when a genetic test reveals the precise genetic abnormality causing the condition in one member of the family, it becomes simple to test other family members. Those who do not carry the faulty gene copy can be reassured and spared countless hospital visits.""

Poaching has been linked in the past to rebel groups in the region, who have connections to smuggling rings.
The Gourma elephants migrate around 600km (370 miles) a year to feed.
Because of the sparse vegetation in northern Mali they have a long-distance migration pattern that runs into Burkina Faso and Niger.
On Tuesday, Colonel Soumana Timbo of the government's nature conservation division asked MPs to provide military support to protect the species.
Mr Timbo told the BBC that the small number of rangers assigned to the region were already risking their lives.
""In the Gourma zone there is total insecurity. We have about 10 rangers covering about 1.25 million hectares, so it's quite insufficient,"" Mr Timbo said.
""If we send out two rangers on a motorbike they are risking their lives. So we really need joint patrols - military and rangers - and we need to focus all our efforts on stopping this massacre.""
Northern Mali has been a flashpoint of conflict since Mali's independence from French rule in 1960, with the Tuareg rebels campaigning for independence or more autonomy.
The region has been further destabilised by the emergence of jihadi groups including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has targeted both the government and the rebels.

411,"A report to a UN ocean conference in New York points out that more than 60% of the ocean has no rules because it’s outside national jurisdiction.
It says the open ocean is at risk from climate change, over-fishing, deep sea mining, farm pollution and plastics.
The authors say one area – the Bay of Bengal - is at a tipping point which could impact on global fish stocks.
The report was commissioned to inform delegates preparing a UN resolution on governance of the open ocean.
Representatives in New York are preparing a text that could cover everything from establishing marine protected areas to distributing the benefits of valuable biotech products generated from the seas.
One of the report’s authors, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University, told BBC News: “This is very, very important. A lot of states are looking towards developing industrial activities in the ocean – fishing, deep-sea mining, renewable energy… even aquaculture offshore.
“It’s really vital that we come to some international agreement on how to protect or manage biodiversity on high seas in the face of all these pressures.”
The UN is focusing discussion on three areas:
Together they are categorised under a new UN acronym – BBNJ. That’s Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction.
Prof Rogers’ report is a review of new science over the past five years. He says he realises how little is known about some essential ocean processes, and mentions the Bay of Bengal issue as a source of great concern.
The issue there is nitrogen, which performs an positive role in fertilising algae at the bottom of the food chain, but can also have negative effects if there’s too much of it in the water.
At the moment, nitrogen fertilisers in the Bay of Bengal are running off farmland and over-fertilising algae. This in turn encourages bacteria, which capture oxygen. Slowly marine life in the area disappears.
But the Bay of Bengal is now on the verge of going one destructive stage more.
The report says if oxygen levels decrease further as a result of run-off or increasing water temperatures, then the entire ocean basin may flip to a no-oxygen status.
In one of Nature’s paradoxes, this would then lead to different bacteria actually removing nitrogen from the water.
Prof Rogers said the de-nitrified water would then be carried away by ocean currents, and greatly reduce ocean productivity elsewhere.
Dr Greg Cowie from Edinburgh University told BBC News that the growing dead zone in the Bay of Bengal would have enormous local consequences.
“You have to remember there are 400 million people living round the rim of the bay. There are half a million fishers. If the situation gets much worse we are going to get a huge human problem,” he said.
Christiana Figueres, a former chief climate negotiator, is joining a push at the UN for a formal treaty process to safeguard the high seas.
She says a healthy ocean can buffer the planet against changing climate by continuing to soak up CO2 emissions from the air.
She told BBC News: “As with the atmosphere, the high seas belong to everyone. But they have also been damaged by all.  What could be seen by some as the tragedy of the commons can also be recognized now as an opportunity for a radical recovery of the commons.”
The deep sea is the biggest store of CO2 emissions from humanity, as ocean circulation pulls in carbon from the atmosphere and tiny marine plants called phytoplankton soak it up.
These are then eaten by creatures called zooplankton and their bodies sink to the ocean floor.
The Oxford scientists say as the seas warm, the abundance of phytoplankton may fall. This will impact the whole food web, including fish stocks and the rate at which CO2 is locked up on the sea bed.
They also say raised sea temperatures have resulted in the rise of Vibriobacteria, which live in warm seas and have been associated with a global increase in illnesses like cholera, gastroenteritis, wound infections and septicaemia.
They echo the many recent warnings about increasing quantities of plastics large and small, although they say the effects are as yet poorly understood.
Their report says the effects of ocean mining must be carefully monitored, too.
Meanwhile, a third UK pub group has announced it will stop using plastic straws is a small contribution to reducing ocean plastic waste. The Liberation Group, based in the West Country and the Channel Islands, is supporting Jersey’s Straws Suck campaign.

Despite his lack of senior managerial experience, Ferguson admitted he would ""run back"" to a club he helped to 15 domestic trophies as a player, including five league titles.

While under-20s coach Graeme Murty remains in caretaker charge following Warburton's departure on 10 February, Ferguson believes other favourites for the role would not want the job on a temporary basis.
And he gave his backing to Aberdeen boss McInnes, who played alongside Ferguson at Rangers, as a ""perfect"" permanent appointment.

Jewish association chief Ognjen Kraus said the snub was a warning to the new centre-right government, which took power in January.
Tens of thousands died at the camp known as the ""Croatian Auschwitz"".
Ethnic Serbs and anti-fascist groups are also boycotting next week's official ceremony.
The death camp - whose victims included Jews, Serbs and Gypsies - operated under the Ustashe regime, which ran Croatia as a Nazi puppet state.

""This is an avalanche that has been rolling for more than a year,"" said Mr Kraus, president of the Co-ordinating Committee of the Jewish Communities.
In January, ultra-nationalists shouted pro-Nazi slogans at a rally attended by thousands of people, including Deputy Parliamentary Speaker Ivan Tepes.

Mansfield voted most strongly to leave, with 70.9% backing Brexit.
Rushcliffe, which includes the towns of West Bridgford and Bingham, was the only area to vote for Remain.
It saw the East Midland's highest turnout.
Meanwhile, the turnout in Nottingham was the fifth lowest in the UK at 61.8%.
Leave won by a tiny margin of just over 2,000 votes in the city.
Mr Mann said his party was ""somewhat out of touch"".
""With the middle classes largely voting remain because they see it as benefiting them and the working classes largely voting to leave because it dis-benefits them - that's the divide in Britain,"" he said.

Like large parts of England, Nottinghamshire overwhelmingly voted to leave the European Union.
The margin of victory in Bassetlaw, Ashfield and Mansfield was huge, with less than a third of people voting remain.
Arguably the biggest surprise came in Nottingham, which narrowly backed Brexit.
Affluent Rushcliffe was the only area to vote Remain.
Overall Nottinghamshire voted 57.9% for Leave and 42.1% for Remain.
Conservative Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe and a Remain campaigner, tweeted it was ""a dreadful decision"".
""People like me were told you're scaremongering, we don't want to listen to the experts,"" she said.
""All that has been unfortunately proved to be accurate. We have made a very, very, very bad mistake.""

417,"Wales international Rhys Priestland's early penalty, followed by conversions of tries for both Leroy Houston and Ollie Devoto gave Bath a 17-0 lead.
Despite Irish scrum-half Brendan McKibbin's red card, Scott Steele's try whittled it back to 17-7 by the break.
But Bath ran in four second half-tries from Alafoti Faosiliva, Kyle Eastmond, Priestland and Nikola Matawalu.
Irish were always up against it from the 20th minute onwards after Australian scrum-half McKibbin was sent off for stamping on prop Henry Thomas's head.
And their only second-half response was a try from Fergus Mulchrone 11 minutes after the break, also converted by Shane Geraghty.
Former Exiles full-back Tom Homer, playing against his old club for the first time, then England fly-half George Ford took over Bath's second-half kicking duties.
Homer converted the first two before Ford came off the bench to also get on the scoresheet by improving the last two.
The fourth of Bath's six tries earned the visitors a bonus point as they recorded their eighth win in nine visits to the Madejski Stadium to hand the Exiles a fourth straight Premiership defeat.
Along with Newcastle, who were beaten at Worcester, Irish are one of two teams at the foot of the table still seeking their first point.
Bath confirmed on Friday that they had ""settled on agreeable terms"" to allow rugby league convert Burgess to return to the 13-man code and rejoin Australian side South Sydney Rabbitohs.
The momentum appeared to swing London Irish's way in the 20th minute when Bath flanker Alafoti Fa'osiliva was yellow carded for a late tackle and the Exiles were awarded a penalty try.
However, replays showed that in the build-up, Irish scrum-half McKibbin had stamped on Henry Thomas - for which referee Tom Foley brandished a red card and the penalty try was chalked off.
The effect of the extra man was not immediately apparent as, within five minutes of Faosiliva's return, Ollie Devoto was then sin-binned too for a late shoulder charge on Shane Geraghty.
But Bath raced out of the traps after the break when Fa'osiliva and centre Kyle Eastmond touched down within two minutes of each other.
Once fellow centre Devoto had returned to bring the visitors back up to their full complement of players, there was no doubt about the end result.
A first try for the club from Priestland after a strong diagonal run followed and, when Asaeli Tikoirotuma failed to deal with Semesa Rokoduguni's chipped kick, Nikola Matawalu finished things off.
London Irish head coach Tom Coventry:
""I didn't have a chance to go back and view (the red card) closely so I'm not going to comment about what happened.

""We're going to have to look at the discipline from our point of view.

""I haven't come over here to sit around and lose. We've just got to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves. We're a team that has been under achievers and we're desperate to prove ourselves.""
Bath head coach Mike Ford:
""Myself and (captain) Stuart Hooper spoke to Sam Burgess on Monday. He said he would address the team and at no point did he mention he wanted to leave.
""Whether I was naive or not I was hoping that he'd get through that week, but we never got that chance.
""We're pleased after everything that's happened. We got some good tries from the backs and we're looking forward to Toulon now.
""We couldn't handle their drive. The discipline of our defence was poor, and then the turning point (McKibbin's red card) was massive. That turnaround is good fortune for us, bad luck for them.""

418,"An ""in-depth investigation"" will look into claims made by Veracruz governor Miguel Angel Yunes Linares on Monday, the Ministry of Health said.
He alleged fake medicine had been bought and used in state hospitals under his predecessor Javier Duarte.
Mr Duarte has been on the run from the authorities since October.
The former governor, who was elected in 2010,  has not been seen since a week after he stepped down amid allegations of corruption.
He has been charged with organised crime and money laundering, but there are calls for the Attorney General's office to file criminal charges relating to the latest accusations.
On Monday, Mr Yunes Linares told a press conference that an investigation into malfeasance and corruption under Mr Duarte had uncovered medical fraud.
`We have tests on a medication given to children, a paediatric chemotherapy that wasn't really a medication, it was an inert substance, practically distilled water,'' he said.
""This really seems to us a brutal crime, an attempt against the lives of the children. We're finishing our analysis and, at the appropriate time, we'll be filing legal complaints.""
Mr Yunes Linares also alleged there had been inadequate tests for HIV detection and the existence of outdated medicines.
The allegations have shocked Mexico.
""It is absolutely inhuman, criminal,"" Senator Roberto Gil Zuart said, according to Mexican news site Quadratin.

419,"The test investigates whether people can detect if they are talking to machines or humans.
The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think?
No computer has passed the test before under these conditions, it is reported.
However, some artificial intelligence experts have disputed the victory, suggesting the contest had been weighted in the chatbot's favour.
The 65-year-old Turing Test is successfully passed if a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30% of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations.
On 7 June Eugene convinced 33% of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human.
Other artificial intelligence (AI) systems also competed, including Cleverbot, Elbot and Ultra Hal.
Judges included actor Robert Llewellyn, who played an intelligent robot in BBC Two's  science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lord Sharkey, who led the successful campaign for Alan Turing's posthumous pardon, over a conviction for homosexual activity, in 2013.
Eugene was created by Vladimir Veselov, who was born in Russia and now lives in the United States, and Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, who now lives in Russia.
Transcripts of the conversations are currently unavailable, but may appear in a future academic paper.
The judges and hidden human control groups were kept apart throughout the test.
The event was organised by Reading University's School of Systems Engineering in partnership with RoboLaw, an EU-funded organisation examining the regulation of emerging robotic technologies.
Alan Turing was an English mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of computer science.
The event has been labelled as ""historic"" by the organisers, who claim no computer has passed the test before.
""Some will claim that the Test has already been passed,"" said Kevin Warwick, a visiting professor at the University of Reading and deputy vice-chancellor for research at Coventry University.
""The words Turing test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However, this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted.
""A true Turing test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations. We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's test was passed for the first time on Saturday.""
Prof Noel Sharkey, a leading expert in robotic technology and artificial intelligence, said: ""It is indeed a great achievement for Eugene. It was very clever ruse to pretend to be a 13-year-old Ukranian boy, which would constrain the conversation. But these competitions are really great to push developments.""
But others have criticised the claim.
""It's nonsense,"" Prof Stevan Harnad told the Guardian newspaper. ""We have not passed the Turing test. We are not even close.""
Hugh Loebner, creator of another Turing Test competition, has also criticised the University of Reading's experiment for only lasting five minutes.
""That's scarcely very penetrating,"" he told the Huffington Post, noting that Eugene had previously been ranked behind seven other systems in his own 25-minute long Loebner Prize test.","A computer program called Eugene Goostman, which simulates a 13-year-old Ukrainian boy, is said to have passed the Turing test at an event organised by the University of Reading.",27762088,"A chatbot named Eugene has successfully passed the Turing Test, a 65-year-old experiment that assesses whether machines can think like humans, by convincing 33% of judges that it was human during a series of five-minute conversations, despite some critics questioning the validity of the victory.",0,"Article: {}

420,"He is among thousands of Burmese Tamils living in the north-eastern Indian town of Moreh in Manipur state, which borders Myanmar, also known as Burma.
Mr Sarlan and other Indian-origin people were forced to leave the country following a military coup in the 1960s. Their businesses were nationalised and Mr Sarlan, who used to live in Rangoon (now called Yangon), and others became penniless refugees overnight.
It is estimated that nearly 300,000 Indians fled the country following the coup.
""After we reached India, for the first three months we were living in a refugee camp in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu was the land of our forefathers, it was difficult to live there without any support,"" recalls Mr Sarlan, 74, who is now a social activist.
'Mini-India'
Indians lived in Burma for centuries, but large-scale migration took place during British-colonial rule, when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were used as civil servants, traders, farmers, labourers and artisans - and came to be considered the backbone of the economy.
Burmese nationalists always viewed them with suspicion and there were a series of anti-Indian riots in the 1930s. Once the British left in 1948, Indian-origin people became increasingly vulnerable and they were swiftly forced to leave following the 1962 coup.
They found it difficult to settle in India, so many decided to return to Burma by land. They vaguely knew that India's north-eastern states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh shared a border with Burma.
After weeks of travelling by train and bus a small group managed to reach Moreh, around 3,200km (2,000 miles) by road from Tamil Nadu. When they reached the border crossing, Burmese soldiers prevented them from entering the country.
The Tamils settled in Moreh hoping one day to return to their homeland - but those dreams have never been fulfilled.
""Moreh was a tribal village when we first came here. There was hardly any infrastructure at that point. But many Burmese people came to Moreh looking for Indian goods like automobile parts, clothing and cosmetics. Since we knew the Burmese language it was easy for us to start businesses,"" Mr Sarlan recalls.
Soon, the Tamils in Moreh invited their relatives and friends from camps in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere to join them.
Many went on to become Indian citizens.
By the 1990s the number of Burmese Tamils in Moreh had increased to about 15,000, almost half of the town's population. They had set up their own schools, temples, churches and mosques - and celebrated their cultural festivals with fervour. Moreh was described as a ""mini-India"".
""We still retain lots of cultural and social links with Tamil Nadu state. For our important temple festivals we bring priests and music performers from there. Many parents in Moreh also send their children to schools in Tamil Nadu,"" says K Balasubramaniam, who is the principal of a local secondary school.
Chinese goods
At one point, Burmese Tamils dominated local border trade and that led to resentment from the Kuki community and others.
Several people were killed in bloody clashes between Tamils and Kukis in 1995, but relations have improved since then.
""We take part in each other's cultural and religious festivals. We have several committees to look into any problems and they get sorted out immediately,"" says Manohar Mohan, a Tamil businessman.
Tamil businesses suffered a setback after the Burmese government established a market just inside their border in Namphalong in the mid-1990s. Chinese products flooded in and many Burmese started shopping in Namphalong rather than Moreh.
Traders in Manipur also faced threats from insurgents in the state - some of the businessmen who refused to pay ""extortion money"" were shot dead.
The violence and lack of business opportunities forced many traders and Burmese Indians to leave Moreh, many opting for Chennai. Now Moreh's Tamil population is just 3,500.
'Gateway'
The insurgency has been contained to a large extent in the last few years. Many traders in Moreh hope the town will regain its business importance once the long-pending Asian Highway, linking the state capital Imphal with Yangon and Bangkok materialises.
Moreh is considered to be India's gateway to South East Asia and locals believe because of its unique geography the place offers tremendous potential.
The story of the town's Burmese Tamils is one of suffering and resilience as well as achievement.
Many elderly Tamils, originally from Burma, are nostalgic and want to stay in Moreh, as it is closer to where they come from.  But later generations say the town offers little in terms of education and employment.
""If we don't have the right education facilities then we have to go elsewhere. We can't do higher studies here. Also, girls can get only teaching jobs here in Moreh. So there are no other options but to leave this town and go to a place like Chennai,"" says B Revathy, a university student.
Emotional attachment it seems may not be enough for Moreh to keep its Burmese Tamils.","Every day Mohamed Eusoof Sarlan looks at his beloved homeland, a few hundred metres away from where he lives - but Myanmar's soldiers will not allow him to return to his country.",33973982,"The article tells the story of the Burmese Tamils who fled Myanmar after the 1962 military coup and settled in the Indian town of Moreh, Manipur, where they established a thriving community despite facing challenges and violence, but later generations are now leaving due to limited education and employment opportunities.",0,"Article: {}

424,"Eric, as it was called, was originally built in 1928, and was the UK's first humanoid robot, impressing audiences with his movement and speech.
He travelled the globe as a showcase for futuristic technology - but disappeared in the 1930s.
Now, the museum is trying to raise Â£35,000 to rebuild him and has received more than Â£6,000 in four days.
Eric was created by British duo Captain William H Richards and Alan Reffell. Made mostly from aluminium and weighing 45kg, he could stand, move his limbs and rotate his head.
Perhaps most impressive for the time, Eric could apparently respond to voice commands and ""speak"" - but only in carefully stage-managed appearances.
""Eric holds a unique place in our history. He was everything we now imagine a robot to be - a talking, moving mechanical person,"" Museum curator Ben Russell said.
The team behind the project tracked down relatives of Eric's inventor to collect as many documents as possible, including photographs, drawings and technical diagrams.
Working with robotics artist Giles Walker, the plan is to reconstruct Eric as faithfully as possible using modern components.
""It's one of our human instincts to anthropomorphise; we've built machines that look like us,"" Russell said in an interview with Wired Magazine.
""Robots are almost like mirrors, they reflect back on ourselves, tell us who we are and how we are and what we think is important. When you take that long view you realise the places where you tend to find robots say a lot about the time and why they were important.""
Eric was first built at short notice for the London Engineering Exhibition of 1928, when the keynote speaker dropped out of his opening address. Instead, the robot was scheduled to make the opening speech.
Writing about the unveiling at the time, Popular Science Monthly said: ""The Thing's enormous size and the stark immobility of his face gave him a really terrifying quality... [the crowd] returned his lifeless gaze.
""They felt subconsciously that here was some strange symbol of relentless Fate itself.""
Eric stood up and began his speech as any human might: ""Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, it gives me great pleasure...""
Robots, at the time, were a relatively new concept. Mechanical automatons had existed for many years, but the term ""robot"" was coined in a 1920 play ""RUR"" by Czech writer Karel Capek. Those letters - for Rossum's Universal Robots - appeared on Eric's chestplate.
The mechanical man proved a hit with audiences and Eric went on tour to technology exhibitions across the world, from Germany to New York.
Some time in the 1930s, however, he disappeared without explanation: lost, dumped, or possibly recycled.
If the museum's project is completed, Eric will form the centrepiece of a new robotic exhibition, which is due to run from February to September 2017.

Mr Connors, 59, Patrick Dean Connors, 39, William Connors, 36, and Lee Carbis, 34, deny several offences.
They are accused of forcing Mr Hughes, 46, and another man - referred to as Mr K - to work for tiny sums.
Mr Connors senior described how he had met Michael Hughes when he was 18, and offered him work.
He said Mr Hughes, originally from Aberdeen, had stayed in his daughter's bedroom, then moved to a converted garage with a shower.
The court heard that Mr Hughes was paid £20 a day, which went up to £50 as he became a more skilled labourer.
Mr Connors senior described how Mr Hughes used to buy sweets for the youngest of his children, who called him brother.
He denied assaulting Mr Hughes during the time he was working with him.
The court has previously heard evidence from the alleged victims that they were only paid £10 per day or less, sometimes in the form of alcohol or tobacco, were beaten or threatened if they did not do as they were told and were hunted down if they tried to get away.
All four defendants deny one count of requiring another person to perform forced or compulsory labour between 2010 and 2013.
Patrick Joseph Connors, of Rumney, Cardiff, has also pleaded not guilty to eight counts of causing actual bodily harm, four of kidnap and one of conspiracy to kidnap.

Mr Maduro also denied that there was a political fight for the succession.
President Chavez was due to be sworn in on 10 January for a fourth term.
The Supreme Court ruled he could take the oath at a later date, a view challenged by opposition figures.
""There is only one president: Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias, supreme commander of the army, commander of the Bolivarian Revolution,"" Mr Maduro told legislators.
He also used his speech to announce that the Mr Chavez had appointed former vice-president Elias Jaua as Venezuela's new foreign minister.
The post was previously held by Mr Maduro.
The vice-president saluted National Assembly president, Diosdado Cabello, and dismissed rumours that they are political rivals.
""They say Cabello and I are fighting. But Cabello and I are united in our heart, in loyalty to a man who has the supreme command of this country.""
The vice-president said that his appearance to give the state of the union address was in accordance with the constitution, as Mr Chavez had been granted leave of absence by the National Assembly.
This view was challenged by some legal experts - they highlight Article 237 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the president should appear ""personally"" to give the speech within 10 days of the inauguration of the legislature.
The current assembly was sworn in on 5 January.
Within 10 days of the inauguration of the National Assembly, in routine session, the President of the Republic shall personally present, each year, to the Assembly a message in which they give account of the political, economic and administrative aspects of their administration during the previous year.
BBC's Sarah Grainger in Caracas says that the speech, which in Mr Chavez's hands could go on for hours, lasted a matter of minutes with Mr Maduro.
President Chavez underwent a fourth operation for cancer on 11 December, and suffered post-operative complications.
Mr Maduro told legislators he had met Mr Chavez in Havana on Monday and that his health was improving.
""He is climbing the hill, he is fighting with his spirit, his vision, his love,"" said Mr Maduro, adding that Mr Chavez has been briefed on developments in Venezuela.
Supreme Court justices have ruled that Mr Chavez, who has been in office since 1999, can be sworn in for another term as president at a later date.
Opposition leaders say the government is riding rough-shod over the constitution and have demanded clarity about who is running the country.

428,"""Nobody risks £15,000 on a hunch,"" said a spokesman for William Hill, who make the band 6/4 favourites to get the gig.
Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power have also suspended betting.
A spokesman for Radiohead said he had ""no comment"" on whether the band would be performing the Spectre title track.
Bond star Daniel Craig is known to be a Radiohead fan, having quizzed frontman Thom Yorke for Interview magazine in 2013.
Speculation about whom will sing the song has been feverish in recent days, with Ellie Goulding emerging as another favourite.
The star posted a photo on Monday that appeared to hint she had been chosen.
""That's a wrap!"" the singer wrote on Instagram, next to a photograph of her leaving Abbey Road studios in London.
The historic recording facility was where Adele recorded the title track for Skyfall, the previous James Bond film, in 2012.
The Showbiz 411 website reported on Tuesday that Goulding had registered a song called Spy with music rights organisation BMI, a song it suggested was the theme song for Spectre.
According to NME, though, a spokesman for the singer later confirmed she had been working on her new studio album at Abbey Road.
""The first gamble of the day was Ellie Goulding and punters were backing her as if she already had the gig,"" said William Hill's Rupert Adams on Tuesday.
""But just as we were thinking of pulling the plug we had a load of bets for Radiohead, including one customer who asked to place a £15,000 bet on the band at 10/1.""
If Yorke's band are chosen to record the title track for Spectre, it would be the first group to sing a James Bond title song this century.
The last band to have that honour was Garbage, who performed the title track for The World is Not Enough, in 1999.
The makers of Spectre have yet to announce who will sing the song, though director Sam Mendes has confirmed a song has been recorded.
""It's fantastic and I'm very excited about it,"" he told BBC Radio's Test Match Special. ""You won't have to wait long.""
Sam Smith, another mooted candidate, denied rumours he would be singing the theme tune earlier this month.
""People seem to think I'm doing it but I have no idea what's going on,"" he told Capital FM. ""I think I would know by now.""
A spokeswoman for Coral told the BBC the bookmaker had decided to suspend betting on Tuesday following Goulding's cryptic hint.
A spokesman for Paddy Power said it had not accepted any bets since Mendes' confirmation that an artist had been chosen, while Ladbrokes' spokeswoman said it suspended betting last week.

Hacking was directed at Russian and US government officials, including security, diplomatic and military personnel, according to the DOJ.

433,"A High Court judge in Belfast had ruled that the PSNI should not have facilitated illegal parades, and was wrong to think it did not have legal powers to stop them.
The ruling was quashed after an appeal.
The UK Supreme Court has now been asked to overturn the decision.
There were widespread loyalist protests across Northern Ireland after Belfast City Council decided not to fly the Union flag at the City Hall every day of the year in December 2012.
The protests included a weekly parade between east Belfast and City Hall, which passed the nationalist Short Strand area.
Critics accused the police of being too soft as some of the protests descended into violence.
The PSNI insisted it did not have the legal powers to stop them, and warned that doing so might have made the situation worse.
In April 2014, a judge in the High Court in Belfast upheld a claim by a Short Strand resident, who cannot be named to protect his safety, that the PSNI had failed in its legal duty to stop the parades.
The judge said the police had not understood the full scope of their powers and had facilitated illegal and sometimes violent parades, in breach of their legal duties.
That ruling was appealed by then Chief Constable Matt Baggott, and quashed by the Court of Appeal.
The legal battle moved to the UK Supreme Court in London on Tuesday.
A lawyer representing the unnamed resident, told five judges the PSNI had failed in its duty to enforce the law as set out in the Public Processions Northern Ireland Act (1998).
She argued that the Court of Appeal had no grounds to interfere and overturn the original trial decision as ""the evidence before the court was unimpeachable"".
The lawyer said there were ""evident flaws"" in the Court of Appeal decision and its analysis of the evidence.
Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, asked her: ""So you say that we should go back to the trial judge and, provided we concluded that there was evidence on which he could fairly reach the decision that he did, that we should reinstate his decision?""
She replied: ""Yes.""
But a lawyer representing the PSNI said the Court of Appeal had made the correct decision.
He said the context of the time the protests had taken place was important.
He told the court the police had been dealing with a series of sporadic unplanned protests at more than 80 locations across Northern Ireland.
He insisted there had been ""no error of law"" and that the police fully understood that they could have stopped the parades, but took an operational decision not to so.
He said the police believed that ""robust action"" could have made the situation worse and took a deliberate decision to secure evidence of offences committed and to prosecute offenders afterwards.
The lawyer referred to research by Queen's University, which recorded that 306 people had been convicted of flag-protest-related offences across Northern Ireland in the months after the protests.
""Many would have considered the police approach to policing these parades was successful, and that their policy of de-escalation succeeded,"" he said.

It urges the government to put ""the public's interests before the touts"".
A government consultation on the resale of tickets closes on Friday.
""As artist managers, we deplore the increasing industrial-scale abuse and insider exploitation of tickets for music, arts and sports events by ticket touts,"" the letter says.
""The consequence in many cases is that fans will attend fewer shows, meaning that the profits made by such immoral practice is also money lost from the industry.""
It is signed by managers for the UK's biggest live acts including One Direction, Little Mix, Radiohead, Mumford and Sons, Iron Maiden, Arctic Monkeys and Noel Gallagher.
The letter agrees there is a need for ""genuine, transparent ticket resale/exchange"" through businesses selling tickets at face value, and urges the review to recommend ""all parties in a ticketing transaction should indentify themselves"".
Earlier this week concert promoter Harvey Goldsmith told the BBC the issue of secondary ticketing websites was ""a national disgrace"".
He told Radio 4's Front Row programme that tickets to U2's recent London shows were advertised for up to Â£3,300 on resale sites, despite a face value of Â£182.
""We're asking the government to pass a law which says you cannot sell a ticket for more than 10%  of its face value,"" Goldsmith told the BBC.

He has not spoken since his return to his family hometown in Ohio.
""His neurological condition can be best described as a state of unresponsive wakefulness,"" said Dr Daniel Kanter.
Mr Warmbier ""shows no understanding of language"" and has ""extensive loss of brain tissue"" which was likely caused by cardiopulmonary arrest, he said.
According to scans taken after he arrived at the Cincinnati Medical Center earlier this week, there is no sign that he was physically abused during his detention, his doctors say.
Mr Warmbier's condition is ""not what we normally see with traumatic brain injury. It's the type we see with cardiopulmonary arrest,"" Dr Kanter told reporters.
They believe respiratory arrest led to his condition, which is caused by a lack of oxygen and blood in the brain.
Earlier on Thursday, Mr Warmbier's father expressed doubts about the North Korean account of what caused the University of Virginia student's coma.
""Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care.""
Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist.
He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel.
Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases.
It's caused by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves.
Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis.
That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles.
Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds.
The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison).
This rarely happens in modern Western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier.","A team of US doctors have found ""no sign of botulism"" in the American student freed by North Korea after more than 15 months in captivity.",40297248,"Otto Warmbier, a 22-year-old American student who was detained in North Korea for 15 months, has been diagnosed with a severe neurological condition caused by cardiopulmonary arrest, which is characterized by extensive loss of brain tissue and a state of unresponsive wakefulness, despite doctors finding no signs of physical abuse during his detention.",0,"Article: {}

437,"Thunderstorms are short, sharp and shocking - for some literally.
If you can hear the clouds rumbling, chances are the storm is close enough for you to be hit by lightning - it can strike up to 10 miles away from the centre of a storm.
Count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder - if it is less than 30 seconds, there is a threat.
If thunderstorms are forecast, postpone or cancel outdoor activities - especially golf and rod fishing.
If a storm is approaching, take cover inside or in a car with the windows wound up - sheds, isolated trees and convertibles do not afford sufficient protection.
Boaters and swimmers should get to shore as quickly as possible, as water conducts electricity. So too do metal pipes and phone lines.
Unplug all non-essential appliances, including the television, as lightning can cause power surges.
Do not use candles if the lights go out, as this poses a fire risk, and instead use a torch.
Do not make phone calls, unless it is in an emergency, or put up an umbrella - the metal directs the current into the body.
It is also best to put off baths, showers and dish washing, in case lightning strikes the house and sends a jolt of electricity through the metal plumbing.
If caught outside in a thunderstorm, find a low spot away from trees, fences, and poles.
If your skin tingles and hair stands on end, lightning is about to strike.
Crouch down immediately, balancing on the balls of your feet, placing hands on knees with head between them.
This makes you into the smallest target possible, and minimises contact with the ground.
If someone has been hit by lightning, call for help as they will need urgent medical attention.
It is safe to touch them - people struck by lightning carry no electrical charge that can shock other people.
Check for a pulse and for breathing - if you know first aid, begin artificial respiration and CPR if necessary.
If they are breathing, check for other possible injuries.
Lightning strike victims have burns in two places - where the electric shock entered and then left the body, usually the soles of the feet.
They may have broken bones or loss of hearing or sight.
If waters start to rise, head for higher ground.
Do not try to drive to safety, as cars can float in as little as a couple of feet of water, the depth of which is often very difficult to judge.
Be wary of venturing out too soon - the BBC Weather Centre advises waiting 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning.
Avoid downed power lines or broken cables.
And one final tip - it is a myth that lightning never strikes the same place twice and always hits the tallest object.
Lightning strikes the best conductor on the ground - whether it has been struck before or not.

438,"Sterling did subsequently recover some of the losses.
But there is certainly a view that the currency would decline if Britain were to decide to leave.
Some analysts expect the fall in the value of sterling in the event of a Brexit vote would be very sharp .
The concern reflects the view held by many - though by no means all - economists that leaving the EU would undermine the UK's economic performance.
How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.
There would be a period of uncertainty about access to the EU market for British exporters while new arrangements were negotiated. The ultimate result could be that it would be harder to sell to the EU market. It is argued that foreign investment could be hit by the uncertainty.
This would be going on at a time when the UK has a large deficit in what is called ""the current account deficit"" - which is trade in goods and services plus some international financial transactions.
The deficit has to be financed by loans and foreign investment in financial assets. Unease about the economic outlook could mean that foreign investors would only provide the finance for the deficit if sterling were cheaper.
There is of course another view, reflected by Economists for Brexit that the UK would prosper outside the EU.
For the short term however, it is more likely to be the majority view that moves markets and sterling in particular.
Our reporting on the currency markets usually focuses on what's called the spot rates, the exchange rate that an investor pays to buy currency immediately.
But they can also buy options, which are rights to buy or sell a currency (or other types of financial asset) in the future at a price fixed in advance. It's a way of getting insurance against a move in the exchange rate. If the move you are worried about doesn't happen you don't exercise the option. So you are insured, but you have had to pay for it.
That part of the market suggests that investors do think a leave vote would weaken sterling. That was the message that the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney gave to a parliamentary committee back in March, in rather technical language:
""We have seen a marked increase in implied volatility in the options market around the date of the referendum, once the date became known, and the skews in the option market, in other words the purchase of downside protection if the pound was going to depreciate, had gone up quite sharply.""
In other words, more investors were buying insurance for the time of the referendum against a fall in the pound than a rise.
The Bank also says that about half the decline in sterling since November is due to news related to the referendum.
Here's another sign.
The financial news service Bloomberg calculates what it calls ""implied volatility"" from the options market. It shows a marked increase for the pound against the dollar as the referendum approaches.
John Redwood the Conservative MP and Brexit supporter looks at the sterling issue rather differently. He wrote in his blog: ""The pound fell from over $2 in 2008 to $1.4 in 2009 when we were firmly committed to the EU, so we know other influences can generate large sterling movements"".
And it must be said that Mark Carney fully recognises other factors have influenced sterling in recent months.
On the current account issue, Mr Redwood argues that the immediate impact would be beneficial:

439,"It found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long-term problems in the jobs market.
""One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,"" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study.
The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures.
Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6% of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations.
But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places.
""The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,"" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong.
But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities.
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are ""less accepting"" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities.
This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector.
Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education.
The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison.
But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62% of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language.
It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three.
As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens.
Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been ""encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities.  But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria"".
There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese.
Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium ""designated schools"".
But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment.
As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools.
""Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,"" says Ms Yip.
But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying.
Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home.
Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework.
""There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,"" says Ms Yip.
Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools.
""I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.""
After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013.
But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues.
""Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,"" says Ms Yip.
In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a ""learning framework"" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese.
Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK$800,000 (Â£68,000) to HK$1,500,000 to help them.
But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness.
""It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,"" she says.
""Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,"" says Unison's Ms Yip
Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups.
A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare.
Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service.
Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries.
The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate.
""I identify as a Hongkonger,"" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills.
""If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.""
""The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,"" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.","Ethnic minorities in Hong Kong are ""marginalised"" by the education system, says a university study.",34444284,"Children of minority families in Hong Kong face barriers to learning Cantonese, which can lead to long-term problems in the job market and exacerbate existing inequalities, due to a lack of support and resources provided by the education system.",0,"Article: {}

Google is reviewing the decision.
The nursery, which was not named in the judge's ruling, complained that the reviews were making serious and unfounded claims that it was neglecting children, and that this was harming its business.
Three of the reviews were removed by Google for breaching its anti-spam rules after the nursery complained, including one written in the name of a woman who died in the US in November 2006. Others were found to have been copied and pasted from other websites.
In a ruling handed down last week, the judge CM Berkhout ordered the fourth to be removed because it too was in breach of the rules.
Google was given two weeks to hand over the information related to the four accounts - all of which remain active on Google+ - as well as the exact dates and times the reviews were posted. It was also told to pay more than â‚¬1,500 (Â£1,100, $1,600) to the nursery by the same date.
Paul Tjiam of Simmons and Simmons, who represented the nursery, said he believed the case would make it more difficult for fake reviewers to ""hide themselves behind their computers."" He added that the nursery would contact the people behind the fake reviews before deciding whether or not to pursue civil action against them.

But the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights says it has found no evidence to support claims that the bodies were incinerated.
The Mexican government is sending forensic experts to the area.
The move was announced by Attorney General Arely Gomez Shortly after the IACHR report was published.
Relatives have always rejected the official investigation.
They accused the authorities of covering up the alleged involvement of high-ranking officials and possibly the army in the killings.
The case shocked Mexico and led to weeks of protests against official impunity and the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Analysis: By Katy Watson, BBC News, Mexico City
This report confirms what many people have believed for a long time - that the government's investigation into the disappearance of the 43 students was deeply flawed.
The families of the missing disagreed from the start with the government's version of events - now they've been vindicated.
There is a lot that is still unknown - the report doesn't explain what happened to the students and only suggests possible motives.
But what is clear is that the government needs to step up its efforts to get to the bottom of what actually happened.  President Enrique Pena Nieto has been hugely criticised for his handling of this case - this report will heap yet more pressure on him.
After a six-month investigation, the Washington-based IACHR released a report of nearly 500 pages urging the government to continue looking for the missing students.
A Peruvian fire expert hired by the commission concluded that it was impossible for all the bodies to have been burned at the landfill site in the municipality of Cocula, in the western state of Guerrero.
Jose Torero, from the University of Queensland in Australia, said it would have required 13 tonnes of tyres, 20 tonnes of wood and 13 tonnes of diesel to cremate the bodies.
It would have taken the gang 60 hours to finish the job, he said.
""There is no evidence indicating the presence of a fire of the size [needed] for the cremation of even one body,"" Mr Torero concluded.
The original probe said the trainee teachers were rounded up by corrupt policemen after travelling to the city of Iguala on 26 September and taking part in a protest over job discrimination.
They are reported to have disrupted a rally planned by the mayor's wife later in the evening.
They were then allegedly handed over to the local Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) criminal gang, which was told to kill them and dispose of their bodies.
Several people were arrested in the following days, including the mayor, his wife, local policemen and men accused of belonging to the local gang.
The government said some of the people who took part in the killings led them to the landfill site.

444,"Around one in four births in the UK is by C-section, while in Cyprus the figure is 52% and in Sweden 17%.
The study of 26 European countries, published in the journal BJOG, said more research was needed to find out why the differences existed.
The Royal College of Midwives said health systems had a role to play.
The study, led by researchers at City University London said that Caesarean section rates in most EU countries have shown ""a continuous rise"", although in a few countries there are signs they are flattening out.
It said there could be several possible explanations for this - ""including a fear of litigation, financial incentives, women's requests for Caesarean section and the perception that Caesarean section is a safe procedure"".
The study also said there were consequences to the rise, which included potential raised risks for mothers and babies - such as stillbirth - in future pregnancies.
Caesareans are more likely when babies are born to first-time mothers, when women have multiple births or when the woman in question has already had a Caesarean.
However, there is continuing debate, the study said, about the use of Caesarean section for babies who are breech (feet first), for multiple births and women who have had a C-section already.
In the study, the highest rate of Caesarean sections planned before labour started was in Cyprus at 38.8% and in Italy at 25%.
The lowest rates were found in Finland (6.6%), the Netherlands (7.7%) and Norway (6.6%).
In the UK, planned Caesarean rates are 9% in England, 11% in Wales and Scotland and 14.6% in Northern Ireland.
Emergency C-section rates were highest in Romania at 33% and lowest in Sweden at 8.6%.
In all four countries of the UK, emergency rates are around 15%.
Prof Alison Macfarlane, professor of perinatal health at City University London, said: ""Given that people are supposed to be practising according to evidence, it is surprising there are such wide variations between countries.
""We need a comparative review of national policies and guidelines and further research to ensure that clinical practice is based on evidence.""
She said it was important that the health of mothers and children was also prioritised.
Gail Johnson, professional advisor for education and research at the Royal College of Midwives, said the disparities were likely to be due to differences in health service models and the overall health of different populations.
She said the percentage of women giving birth by Caesarean in the UK was still ""a bit too high"".
""A Caesarean is an emergency procedure, done when a normal birth isn't going to work.

At the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark, 36, was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder.
His brother John, 38, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
Jailing both men, judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out ""a merciless, relentless and savage attack"".
He rejected any suggestion that Mr Bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Dunlop added: ""You together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks.

""To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.""
The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs.
The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks.

452,"Robinson led the club back to the Premiership in May, ending their seven-year stay in the Championship.
But Bristol have lost all seven top-flight games so far this season, leaving them bottom of the table.
The 52-year-old former England and Scotland head coach has been in charge at Bristol since 2013.
Robinson only signed a new three-year contract with the Ashton Gate side in August, but they have since lost all nine of their competitive fixtures - including two in the European Challenge Cup.
A club statement said: ""Bristol Rugby have decided, following the extremely disappointing start to the season, to appoint Mark Tainton as acting head coach with immediate effect.""
Kicking coach Tainton, who joined Bristol prior to the start of the season, has previously worked at London Irish, Wasps and for the Ireland national team coaching staff.
""This is clearly a very difficult time for the club, but we remain confident we can retain our position in the Premiership,"" added Bristol chairman Chris Booy.
Since Bristol's long-awaited return to the top flight began with an encouraging 21-19 loss at Harlequins on the opening day, both results and performances have failed to meet expectations.
A heavy 70-22 defeat at Wasps on 18 September set the tone for a defence which has conceded 34 tries in seven league games.
Injuries have undoubtedly hampered Robinson's side, with 15 senior players ruled out of October's Challenge Cup loss at local rivals Bath.
Long-term absentees have included influential former Wales centre Gavin Henson, who was forced off injured in both of his two appearances this season, including Sunday's 31-13 home defeat by Sale Sharks.

Members of the union were 306 in favour of walkouts and 14 against. A total of 320 votes to one backed other forms of industrial action.
The RMT said it was fighting to keep the conductor grade and the changes were ""nothing short of bullying and harassment"".

454,"Sir Keir Starmer said there was a ""very strong case"" for the Crown Prosecution Service to make the final decision on whether to prosecute cases.
Currently, police forces in England and Wales decide whether to pass a case on to the CPS after investigating a death.
The CPS said cases should be referred to a prosecutor as early as possible.
Department of Transport figures show 113 cyclists were killed in the UK last year.
Last year a Freedom of Information request by BBC's Newsbeat found that between 2007 and 2014 there were 276 recorded incidents where a cyclist was killed in an accident involving a motor vehicle.
Of these, 148 - 54% - resulted in the driver of the vehicle being charged with an offence. Of those found guilty, fewer than half went to prison.
Sir Keir, now a Labour MP, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that if a death was involved and it was serious enough to have had a criminal investigation ""then it really ought to go off to the CPS for the final decision"".
In Scotland, if evidence suggests the driver is to blame for a collision that leads to a cyclist's death, a report is to be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.
But data compiled from a 2014 freedom of information request to Police Scotland suggests this happened in only a small number of cases.
Cycling campaigners are calling for a change in liability - who is considered responsible for a collision - in civil cases.
At the moment there is no presumption on either side.
Last year, my dad Mick was killed as he cycled through central London.
After three weeks in a coma, he died.
At the inquest the driver said the first she realised was when she heard a noise, like something falling from the sky. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.
We had questions about how the police were investigating from very early on. Potential witnesses weren't chased as we would have liked and we felt they just didn't think about what we were going through.
A year on from my dad's death we held a vigil at the spot where his crash happened.
That day, the police told a journalist they would pass the case to prosecutors - which could lead to a trial. It felt like progress.
But this changed just four days later when police again went straight to the journalist, saying the case was actually closed.
I still want to know more about what happened on the night of my dad's crash and the only option for my family is a private prosecution.
The Met Police said they followed all available lines of enquiry in this case.
Rhia Favero, from the cycling charity CTC, said it supported the argument of ""presumed liability"" - placing the onus on the driver to demonstrate they were only partially liable for an accident.
""Currently it's often on the victim to prove liability - which seems very unfair, "" she said.
Sir Keir said the debate over liability had been going on for some time.
""You have to be very careful with this - and I certainly wouldn't want to go to strict liability where it's automatically thought one party is at fault - but we may need to start looking again at that balance,"" he said.
How safe is cycling?
A senior lawyer who has dealt with a number of cases involving cyclists said he thought it was problematic that some senior police officers have said they would not commute on a bike in the capital.
Martin Porter QC said:  ""They're looking at cycling as a dangerous activity. Their emphasis then, and the emphasis of some coroners, is upon whether a cyclist is wearing a crash helmet or high visibility equipment, rather than on whether the people driving in the vicinity of vulnerable road users like cyclists are taking the appropriate amount of care not to collide with them.""
Suzette Davenport, roads policing lead for National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""I wouldn't do that, because it's too busy, there are too many risks.
""One of the things as a police officer, but also in my roads policing role, is my sense of risk is so heightened because of what we deal with on a day-to-day basis. We know there are a range of people who don't go home at the end of the day.""
The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has also previously said he would not cycle in London.
A CPS spokeswoman said the police could make the decision to take no further action.
She added: ""Guidelines on early investigative advice state that specific cases, including those involving a death, should always be referred to an Area Prosecutor as early as possible.""
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","The way cycling deaths are treated by police and prosecutors may need to change, the former Director of Public Prosecutions has said.",34604622,"The article discusses the need for greater accountability in the investigation and prosecution of cases involving cyclist deaths, with advocates calling for a change in liability laws and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) stating that it should make the final decision on whether to prosecute such cases.",0,"Article: {}

455,"Tumours in the ovaries are hard to detect in the earliest stages meaning it can be too late to treat them effectively by the time they are found.
A trial of 4,051 women, reported in the journal Cancer, showed the method could identify those needing treatment.
But a huge study taking place in the UK will give a final verdict on the test when it is completed in 2015.
There is a survival rate of up to 90% when ovarian cancer is caught early, compared with less than 30% if it is discovered in the later stages.
Unlike other cancers, the symptoms, such as pelvic and abdominal pain or persistent bloating, are often put down to other common ailments and the tumour can be missed.
There is no mass screening programme to detect the cancer either.
Scientists already know that levels of a protein in the blood, called CA125, are often higher with ovarian cancer.
However, it is too unreliable on its own. It misses some patients and tells others they have the cancer when they are actually healthy.
Researchers are now testing the idea of using the blood test to sort patients in risk groups based on levels of CA125. Instead of going straight for surgery, low-risk patients are tested again in a year, medium-risk ones after three months and high-risk patients have an ultrasound scan to hunt for tumours.
The US study, at the University of Texas, followed post-menopausal women for 11 years on average.
Ten women had surgery based on their ultrasound scan and all the cancers detected were at an early stage.
Researcher Dr Karen Lu told the BBC: ""Clinical practice definitely should not change from our study, but it gives us an insight - we didn't get a lot of false positives.""
She said the UK study of 50,000 people would give definitive results: ""There are two big questions - do we see cancers at an earlier stage and do we decrease the number of deaths.""
Dr Sarah Blagden, from the Ovarian Cancer Action research centre, said: ""Relative to the trial under way in the in the UK , this is a small study, but it does show that effective ovarian screening is possible.
""In 2015 the results of the UKCTOCs study will become available and the results are eagerly anticipated, more so now that this American study has produced such encouraging results.""
Annwen Jones, the chief executive at Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""The results of this study are without doubt very positive, and we should take hope from that.
""Early detection of ovarian cancer will be the key to transforming survival rates.  However, this study is very small, and there is no guarantee that the results will be replicated on a larger scale.""","A new way of screening for ovarian cancer is showing ""potential"", according to researchers in the US.",23811705,"Researchers have found that using a combination of blood tests and ultrasound scans to screen for ovarian cancer in post-menopausal women may be effective in detecting the disease at an early stage, with the potential to significantly improve survival rates, but larger studies are needed to confirm the findings.",0,"Article: {}

Many residents of what is the largest of the Chagos Islands ultimately resettled in Crawley, West Sussex.

TV presenter Ben Fogle, patron of the UK Chagos Support Organisation, handed in the petition, which had been signed by more than 2,500 people.

459,"Markets run by federal and state governments opened for the millions of Americans seeking insurance plans.
As many as seven million Americans who do not already have health insurance are eligible to purchase coverage in the coming months.
Republican opposition to the law led to the government shutdown on Tuesday.
At the White House on Tuesday, Mr Obama said the opportunity would be ""life changing"" for the ""15% of Americans who don't have health insurance"".
""Tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don't have health insurance,"" Mr Obama said, with Americans set to sign up for plans standing behind him.
""Millions more live with the fear that they'll go broke if they get sick. And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.""
While Mr Obama and his supporters in the Democratic Party portray the law as a historic effort to extend healthcare coverage to the millions of Americans who lack it, the law's opponents say it amounts to an unprecedented intrusion into Americans' private lives.
The online health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, struggled to meet higher than expected demand on Tuesday, with many users reporting long waiting times.
Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Associated Press news agency the agency was ""prepared to make adjustments as needed [to] improve the consumer experience"".
Users also reported errors while trying to create accounts and site crashes on the websites.
""The first day of something that you know is going to have a lot of bugs, it's not that frustrating,"" Mike Weaver, a self-employed photographer without insurance told the Associated Press.
""If it was the last day to sign up... then I'd be terribly frustrated.""
Mr Obama acknowledged the glitches and delays.
""We found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will,"" Mr Obama said.
""The reason is because more than one million people visited healthcare.gov before 7:00 in the morning.""
The exchanges will continue to enrol people through the end of the year for healthcare plans slated to begin next year.
The opening of the exchanges was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.
Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country have fought hard to undermine or undo the law since its passage, with the US House of Representatives taking dozens of symbolic votes to repeal it or eliminate its funding.
A legal challenge led by the law's Republican opponents ended in June 2012 when the Supreme Court validated the law's keystone provision - a requirement that Americans not receiving health coverage from their employers or the government purchase individual plans or pay a fine.
That requirement, known as the individual mandate, takes effect in January.
The healthcare law was also a central issue in the 2012 presidential election. Republican candidate Mitt Romney vowed to press for its repeal. Mr Obama handily won re-election.
On Tuesday, the US government shut non-essential services, keeping more than 700,000 workers at home, when the Democrats who control the Senate refused to agree to Republican demands to repeal the health law or delay the individual mandate.
Both Mr Obama and congressional Democrats have said they will not negotiate on Obamacare, with Mr Obama on Monday evening accusing the Republicans of attempting to refight the last election.
In spite of the political turmoil in Washington, on Tuesday Americans were able to enrol in insurance plans offered by private companies and ranging in price and level of coverage through exchanges in every state.
Sixteen states and Washington DC have opted to operate their own exchanges, while the exchanges in 34 states will be fully or partially run by the federal government.
Exchanges will also inform customers of tax subsidies available to ease the cost of the insurance. An estimated six million US citizens are expected to qualify.
Customers enrolling under Obamacare will not be covered by the insurance until 1 January however.
That corresponds with the start of the individual mandate, as well as consumer protections including a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions.
Several Obamacare provisions had taken effect prior to Tuesday, including prescription drug discounts for pensioners, a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance plans up to age 26, a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to children with pre-existing health conditions, and a ban on lifetime limits on health coverage.
Another major provision known as the employer mandate - which requires employers with at least 50 full-time workers to provide insurance or incur a $2,000 (Â£1,320) per employee penalty - has been delayed until 2015.
That delay, announced by the Obama administration in July, has been seen as a concession to retailers and other businesses - and an acknowledgement that the health law was not fully ready for implementation.","A central provision of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law has taken effect, having survived Republicans' years-long effort to undermine it.",24353675,"On October 1, 2013, the US government launched online health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, in all 50 states and Washington DC, allowing millions of uninsured Americans to purchase health coverage for the first time, despite Republican opposition and glitches on the websites.",0,"Article: {}

The ban until 14 April takes in 10 Super League games and the World Club Series match against Brisbane Broncos.
New Zealander Hohaia had already accepted a one-game suspension for a forearm strike which came before Flower's punches.
Flower was charged with a Grade F offence - the most serious in the sport's disciplinary rules - of ""violent and aggressive punching"" and ""punching an off-guard opponent"", a charge which carries a minimum of an eight-game ban.

The investigation came after they filmed themselves near the site of the air crash where 11 people died after a jet crashed on to the A27 on 22 August.
The recording was made at the police cordon and accompanied by an inappropriate and offensive message.
Sussex Police launched an internal investigation after the footage and message were sent on social media to a colleague who reported the pair.
The force said both constables exercised their right to tender resignations under regulation 13, a provision specific to probationary officers.
Chief Constable Giles York said the pair were ""clearly remorseful"" and had acknowledged the impact of their actions, but would not go on to become ""well-conducted officers"" in his view.
""When it really mattered the officers failed to show understanding and compassion for the victims and their families,"" Mr York said.
Genuine mistakes were forgivable, he added, but said the behaviour of the two officers was ""inexplicable and caused unnecessary distress to the families of those involved"".

467,"If, and when, their big day comes, it could be an expensive business covering the cost of hotels, caterers, photographers and florists, not to mention clothes, rings and a honeymoon.
Campaigners estimate that the average Australian wedding has a price tag of around 35,000 Australian dollars ($27,000; Â£18,000).
""The world's expert body on the economic impact of marriage equality, the Williams Institute at UCLA, says the most conservative estimate for the [potential] wedding spend of Australian same-sex couples is A$161m,"" says Rodney Croome, the national director of Australian Marriage Equality.
""It could be as high as A$600m.
""On top of this, Australia's failure to achieve marriage equality is a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting those skilled migrants and investors for whom non-discriminatory laws are important.""
This week the campaign for reform in Australia received some high-profile support from Alan Joyce, the openly gay, Irish-born chief executive of the airline Qantas.
He told the Sydney Morning Herald: ""I've had people coming up to me in the business community and saying that their son, their daughter is finding it tough (being gay), even in this day and age.
""Talking about how important it is for a business leader ... to express our views on things. It is a role model thing.""
The Flying Kangaroo has a long tradition of equality for its staff.
Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School, says Australia's national airline has been a beacon of progressive thinking.
""When I worked at Qantas they were always ahead of the game in providing benefits for same-sex partners, whether it be travel or superannuation or so on,""  he tells the BBC.
""It has worked out pretty well on the basis that having a happy and egalitarian workforce is good for productivity.""
Other corporate heavyweights are joining the campaign for same sex marriage in Australia. Telecom giant Telstra Qantas and PricewaterhouseCoopers have signed an open letter urging the conservative government to consider the economic benefits of reform.
They have been joined by the nation's biggest banks, ANZ, the Commonwealth and Westpac, along with retailer David Jones.
The letter states:  ""Not only is marriage equality the only truly fair option, but it's also a sound economic option given that a happy workforce is a productive one.
""To remain competitive, and to attract top talent from around the world, organisations - and nations - must create a fair and respectful environment for all.""
Alex Greenwich, an openly gay member of the New South Wales parliament and a former businessman, who ran a recruitment agency before entering politics, believes that employees who are happy and respected at work are more productive.
""There have been so many studies done on the importance of diversity within the workplace and the importance of accepting and treating your staff well in the workplace.
""It's kind of a no-brainer,"" says Mr Greenwich, who believes it is time for Australia to shed its reputation for sexual intolerance.
""We know that gay and lesbian people are out and open in very senior levels in a number of corporates across the world, and a lot of them are now saying why do we want to go to a country where we'll be treated as a second-class citizen?""
The importance of the so-called 'pink dollar' is felt around in the world where reform has been embraced.
But this has done little to soften those opposed to change, who argue that any alterations to Australia's marriage laws would be a backward step.
""I think it is disappointing when we have big business trying to influence governments, and for big business to use their clout in this way is intimidating,"" says Wendy Francis, the Queensland director for the Australian Christian Lobby.
""What is good for the economy is stable families and that is what we are really wanting to protect in Australia.""
Bills to allow gay Australians to marry have been rejected by parliamentarians in the past, and there is currently no legislative timetable for further debate in Canberra.
The conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has deep-seated religious objections, although opinion polls have suggested a majority of voters would be in favour of marriage equality.
While there is resistance at a federal level, laws now exist in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Victoria, as well as the Australian Capital Territory that legally recognise same-sex unions.
Two years ago, New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalise same-sex marriages, and the architects of change believe it has had a transformative effect.
""All gay and lesbian people that I encounter are holding their heads just a wee bit higher because they know that the law no longer distinguishes between them and our heterosexual counterparts in this area at least,"" says Kevin Hague, a Green Party MP, who worked on marriage equality campaign.
""I know that popular wedding destinations like Queenstown and Rotorua have had a real boom time with same-sex couples from Australia coming over the get married here.""","In Australia, at least 18,000 same-sex couples are waiting for the law to change to allow them to get married, according to the University of Queensland.",32655943,"The article discusses the potential economic benefits of legalising same-sex marriage in Australia, including an estimated $161-$600 million increase in spending on weddings and tourism, as well as a more competitive workforce and a more attractive destination for skilled migrants and investors.",1,"Article: {}

He did not give details of casualties.
A resident said that al-Shabab had arrested several people from the remote central Somali village of Raso, after the US bombed its training camp in a nearby forested area on Saturday.
The US said the strike,  by both drones and manned aircraft, was aimed at preventing a ""large-scale attack"" by the al-Qaeda-linked militants.
The resident told the BBC Somali service that al-Shabab recruits from around Somalia had been converging on the camp, about 195km (120 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, since last week.
The US strike appeared to have led to heavy casualties, with al-Shabab reinforcements arriving to collect the dead, the resident added.
Fighters who survived the assault had now left the area, he said.
A spokesman for al-Shabab, Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, confirmed to Reuters news agency that the US had bombed an area controlled by the militants.
However, the US had exaggerated the number of casualties, he said.
""We never gather 100 fighters in one spot for security reasons. We know the sky is full of planes,"" the spokesman added.
On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said that initial assessments were that more than 150 fighters had been killed at the training facility.

The first one, a replica Viking brooch, was found in a wall in Kingsway Gardens, Scunthorpe, by Rachel Welch.
Ms Welch, of Grimsby, said she looked around town on the off-chance she could find one without cracking the codes.
The object was found hours after the treasure hunt began on Saturday.
She said: ""We had a look at them, but we didn't really spend much time with them because we are no good at codes.
""We thought we'd go out and have a look round and see if we are able to find one and we did.""
Bristol-based artist Mr Jerram said a Scoutmaster had cracked the code in the corresponding painting moments before, and arrived at the park to see it had already been claimed.
This particular artwork used semaphore to spell out the clue ""in the gardens seven metres from the flag is the Kingsway xx(rest).""
The gold was hidden in a dry stone wall near a flag, given to the gardens as an environmental award.
Each of the objects is worth more than £1,000 and Ms Welch said she was going to sell it to pay for a holiday.
The second object, a small 18 carat gold lamb, was found in a bandstand in Brigg on Sunday night by a teacher from Beverley. She solved one of the painting's codes to lead her to a place which was ""an octagonal place to listen"".

PM's editor, Roger Sawyer, told Phoebe: ""It would be quite a task.""
A Facebook post by Phoebe's father, Jon Hanson, about the exchange has been liked and shared thousands of times.
The ""Big Ben"" bell, after which the Palace of Westminster's Elizabeth Tower is more commonly known, is expected to fall silent early next year for the first time since 2007 for a three-year renovation project.
The work will cost £29m and involve repairs to the clock's hands, mechanism and pendulum.
Replying to Phoebe's letter on 12 December, Sawyer said he was ""very much taken with your idea"", but there could be some operational obstacles because ""the bongs are live"".
He explained: ""You'd have to rush in after school each day (and at the weekend), rush home for tea, homework, a bit of chillin', then a quick sleep.
""And then - here's the hard bit - you'd have to rush in again at midnight, because there are live bongs again before the midnight news.
""That's an awful lot of work for someone who is still quite young. I wouldn't like to do all that.""
Speaking to BBC News, Mr Hanson said: ""She was listening to Radio 4 in the car and Eddie Mair was saying that Big Ben would stop chiming next year, and she said, 'Oh no, we have to do something about it. I want to write a letter.'
""She was absolutely stunned to get a reply, and was so pleased she took it to school and showed everyone.
""She takes things very literally as she is on the autism spectrum, so I think she still wants to do the bongs.
""I'm very proud of her. I work in IT and we try to increase our internet presence, but then she has stepped in and done it in one fell swoop.""
Writing on his Facebook page, Mr Hanson called Sawyer's response ""priceless"".
""She thinks I should drive her up to Broadcasting House and back twice a day,"" he told others who had commented on his page.
Sawyer said that although he was surprised to receive the letter, he was aware that the bongs at the end of the programme ""seem to chime with the younger audience especially - no pun intended"".
He said Phoebe's hand-written letter - accompanied by a covering letter - suggested she could hum the Westminster chimes before playing her own instrument for the bongs, and that she could record everything on her own microphone brought with her to the studio.
""What I say to people who ask what the job [of working on PM] entails is that it requires a lot of determination and tenacity, but also what is vital is imagination and free thinking,"" he said.

473,"Iain Duncan Smith said the raft of changes should save the taxpayer Â£50bn by the end of this Parliament.
He said the reforms - including tougher criteria for people seeking disability allowances - would ""help and benefit"" those who wanted to return to work.
The Disabilities Trust charity said the reforms were part of a ""triple whammy"" of factors hitting disabled people.
Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Duncan Smith said: ""I think the work programme is now for the first time ever working with people, who were once on sickness benefits and who are now not, going back to work.""
He said the new regime would see disabled benefits claimants assessed on a regular basis to determine whether they need more support with their ailments or help to get work.
""There were over a million [people] not looked at for over 10 years,"" Mr Duncan Smith said.
""These regular reviews, I think, will help them and benefit them. We haven't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people. The purpose is to try to support disabled people.""
He added: ""The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work, and many are going back to work now, and those who need full support get that full support.""
The government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA).
Under the old disability regime, claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance.
Now, they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment.
Mr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change, and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first, and then 50m.
""What we're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments, and those who don't need the higher levels don't take the higher levels,"" Mr Duncan Smith said.
Under the DLA system, he said, 70% of people who made a claim got awards ""for life"".
The new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants' ailments.
He said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expects almost half of the Â£50bn in savings to come in the next 12 months.
The raft of welfare reforms, introduced a year ago, also included what the government calls the removal of the ""spare room subsidy"" but critics call the ""bedroom tax"".
Mr Duncan Smith, defending it, said it was not a tax but rather a ""balanced and fair"" policy for taxpayers.
However, Sarah Clifford, director of communications for the Disabilities Trust, said the reforms were part of a ""triple whammy"" of factors affecting disabled people.
She said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England, Scotland and Wales.
The housing benefits changes - dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a ""spare room subsidy"" - were introduced in April last year.  A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating ""financial hardship and distress"" for disabled people.
Ms Clifford said: ""We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities.""
Meanwhile, the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos, which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work.
Mr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement, saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract.","The work and pensions secretary has defended changes to the welfare system, including disability benefit reforms.",26909658,"Iain Duncan Smith has announced a series of welfare reforms aimed at saving £50 billion by the end of the Parliament, including tougher criteria for disability allowances, regular face-to-face checks, and the replacement of the Disability Living Allowance with the Personal Independence Payment, but charities and critics have expressed concern that the reforms will unfairly target disabled people and lead to financial hardship.",0,"Article: {}

England only needed a draw to finish top of the group and after a lacklustre first half, Nikita Parris set them on the way to victory after the break.
The striker headed home Karen Carney's cross to give England the lead.
England dominated thereafter and Carney doubled the visitors' advantage with a strike which took a heavy deflection.
Jade Moore won the ball and released Carney who neatly beat one defender on the edge of the box before scoring with a strike which went in via Lorca van de Putte.
It was a victory which extended England's unbeaten run to seven matches, with the past five of those ending in victories. The Lionesses last lost a competitive qualifier in November 2002.
England had already qualified for next summer's tournament in the Netherlands thanks to the 5-0 thumping of Estonia on 15 September, but England boss Mark Sampson said before the match in Leuven that he was determined his team would end the qualifiers as group leaders.
Belgium, the only team to have taken a point off Sampson's side during the campaign, could have finished top of Group 7 had they beaten England, but they never truly came close and must settle for second spot.
Neither team impressed in a first half full of stray passes and pedestrian attacks. England's best chance fell to Lucy Bronze, whose long-range effort was a fraction wide from the top corner.
Belgium also had an opportunity to break the deadlock and would probably have scored through a Tessa Wullaert in-swinging corner had Jill Scott not headed the danger away.
Belgium were organised in defence and for most of the match were quick to close down playmaker Karen Carney whenever she received the ball, reducing her influence in the final third and consequently nullifying England.
But on the rare occasions Belgium did give Carney space to pull England's strings, the Chelsea forward was ruthless. First, she floated a lovely cross towards the industrious Parris to score her third international goal and followed up with five minutes remaining with a strike which completely wrong-footed Justien Odeurs thanks to the deflection.
Sampson has proved he is not afraid to make changes - tweaking the formation during this campaign and making two changes to the team which beat Estonia, with Siobhan Chamberlain and Gemma Davison replaced by Karen Bardsley and Gilly Flaherty.
But it was the introduction of Moore that changed the course of this match, with the midfielder breaking up play and giving the visitors more ballast in midfield.

477,"The boy had lived with the twin in his stomach his whole life, but went to hospital after complaining of pain.
His mother told Bernama the foetus ""was formed with organs like those of a baby"".
It is believed to be the first reported case of the condition, known medically as ""fetus in fetu"", in Malaysia.
The boy's mother, 38, said funeral rites had been performed on the foetus and it was buried at a local cemetery.
Reports said the foetus had legs, hands and genitals.
""Only the nose and mouth were not complete,"" she said, saying she had accepted his fate.
The teenager had been admitted to a local district hospital before being referred to the Sultan Abdul Hamid Hospital in Kedah for the operation to remove the twin.
The hospital and Malaysia's government health officials would not comment on the case to the BBC.
What is fetus in fetu?
Dr S Raman, obstetrics and gynaecology specialist at Pantai Hospital in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, told the BBC it is when an ""additional twin gets absorbed into the body of the living twin"".
""It's almost like a vanishing twin, or sometimes called a parasitic twin,"" he said.
""I have actually seen a case of the foetus being attached to the outside of the living twin, so it's possible for the twin to be both inside or outside the body.""
There have also been cases of two twins found inside the abdomen of one child, in the case of a triplet pregnancy.
What causes it?
There is no known trigger, but it occurs in the early stages of development when one foetus wraps around the other.
The enveloped twin then does not fully form but becomes a ""parasite"", relying on their host twin for their survival. Such twins usually die before birth.
The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.
Is it unusual to live so long with the twin?
One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing.
In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman.
The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on.","A 15-year-old Malaysian boy has had the parasitic foetus of his twin removed from his stomach, Malaysia's Bernama state news agency reports.",36376079,"A 15-year-old boy in Malaysia was found to have a non-functional twin fetus inside his body, known as ""fetus in fetu,"" which had formed with organs and was believed to be the first reported case in Malaysia, and while the boy had lived with the twin his whole life, he was admitted to the hospital after complaining of pain and underwent an operation to remove the twin, which is a rare abnormality estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births and can go undetected in areas with limited access to medical facilities.",0,"Article: {}

488,"It would mean some schools being taken from council control and being converted to academies.
There are four investigations examining ""Trojan Horse"" claims that groups of hardline Muslims have been trying to take over schools in the city.
A government source says that no options have been ruled in or out.
The trust which runs Park View, one of the schools caught up in the claims, issued a statement on Thursday dismissing allegations of extremism as false.
The education watchdog Ofsted and the Department for Education are expected to deliver reports in June on the next steps for schools which have faced these allegations.
It is understood that ministers have approached heads of successful schools and academy trusts about taking over other schools where there have been concerns.
This could include taking schools away from local authority control, converting them into academies - directly funded by central government - and putting them under the leadership of high-achieving head teachers.
Groups of outstanding schools like the Perry Beeches chain in Birmingham may have a role.
As some of the schools caught up in the Trojan Horse claims are already academies, it could mean schools being reassigned to other academy trusts.
Birmingham City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on any ""proposed action"" until Ofsted's inspection reports had been published.
""We can say, however, that we are in regular contact with DfE and this action has not been discussed with us,"" said a council spokesperson.
The GMB union warned: ""It is absolutely disgusting that the government is pre-empting the outcome of the investigation into these schools and planning to sell these schools on to their friends in the academy chains.""
Before the Trojan Horse claims, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had spoken publicly of his belief that the local authority might need to be broken up.
Birmingham is the biggest local authority in England - and it is believed that private soundings have shown it would be difficult to find a private sector contractor willing or able to take on the running of such a wide range of services.
But another option would be for some or all of the council's education and children's services to be hived off to an independent trust.
This model has been used before where central government believed there was a need for radical intervention - such as in Hackney in London.
Birmingham City Council's chief executive, Mark Rogers, was recorded at a meeting with school representatives last week, where he warned of a ""firestorm"" when the Ofsted reports were published, and telling his audience to prepare for ""significant structural changes"" within the education department.
The investigations into extremism in Birmingham schools had been sparked by an anonymous and unverified letter claiming that there was a ""Trojan Horse"" conspiracy by a group wanting to impose a more hardline Muslim agenda on schools in the city.
This included claims that head teachers were being replaced with staff who were more likely to be sympathetic to these religious beliefs.
The authenticity of the letter has been disputed, but the National Association of Head Teachers says there seem to have been ""concerted efforts"" to take over six schools in Birmingham.
However, claims of extremism have been categorically denied by Tahir Alam, chairman of governors at Park View School.
And the Park View Educational Trust issued a statement arguing that the response to the letter had created a climate which encouraged false allegations.
The claims about religious extremism were driven by ""the settling of political scores"" and disgruntled former staff, the trust argues.
""Our assemblies, or acts of worship, are used to focus on the spiritual and moral development of pupils and are relevant to their school and home lives,"" said the statement from Park View.
""This includes looking at the common values of kindness, mercy and forgiveness and talking to students about studying hard, and being a good friend.""","Super-heads could take over running clusters of schools in Birmingham, as the government considers its response to allegations of extremism.",27429977,"The article discusses the ongoing investigations into allegations of extremism in Birmingham schools, with the possibility of some schools being taken away from local authority control and converted into academies, and the government considering approaches to high-achieving head teachers to take over schools with concerns; the article also mentions the potential for private sector contractors or independent trusts to take over the council's education and children's services.",0,"Article: {}

An investigation by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) found the lifejackets the men were wearing did not function as they should have done.
The probe also highlighted a delay in the rescue effort.
The bodies of Chris Morrison, 27, from Harris, and Martin Johnstone, 29, from Halkirk, Caithness, were recovered following the sinking.
The body of skipper Paul Alliston, 42, from Lewis, was lost during a lifeboat crew's attempts to recover him and remains missing.
Only Lachlann Armstrong, 27, from Stornoway, Lewis, survived after swimming ashore.
The MAIB said the men who died in the incident were wearing approved lifejackets, but the survival aids did not work as would have been expected.
An urgent review of lifejacket testing protocols by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) has been recommended by the MAIB in a newly-published report of its investigation.
Chief Inspector of Marine Accidents Steve Clinch said: ""A lifejacket should turn an unconscious person onto their back and keep their airway clear of the water.
""It is therefore of concern that the skipper and two crew were tragically found unresponsive and face down in their lifejackets when the rescue services arrived on scene.
""The results of lifejacket trials undertaken by the MAIB and of lifejacket testing commissioned by the MCA following the accident strengthen that concern.
""Therefore, as a matter of urgency, I am recommending the MCA to conduct further research to confirm or otherwise the suitability of historical and extant lifejacket water performance test protocols.""
The Louisa had been anchored close to shore in Mingulay Bay.
The skipper and crew, who had been working long hours before anchoring late the previous evening, were asleep onboard, said the MAIB.
Investigators believe the boat's deck wash hose flooded the hold and the crew were woken by the Louisa ""sinking rapidly"".
The four men escaped to the aft deck, activated the boat's emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) and put on lifejackets.
However, they were unable to inflate the liferaft as they abandoned the vessel.
Louisa's EPIRB was detected and the coastguard was alerted.
But the MAIB said ""confusion over terminology resulted in delays before search and rescue units were sent to the scene"".
The investigation of the incident involved raising the wreck of the crab boat and taking it to Clydebank.
A spokeswoman for the MCA said: ""This is a deeply tragic incident and our thoughts remain with the families of these fishermen, who've suffered a terrible loss.
""Saving lives at sea is our highest priority, and we strive to ensure that our search and rescue techniques are  continually reviewed in order to deliver an effective and efficient emergency response.""
She added: ""The MCA is continuing to collaborate with the MAIB on the contents of this report in order to address the recommendations put forward.""
A spokesman for Louisa fishing vessel owners, Duncan and Murdo Kennedy, said: ""The tragic events of 9 April 2016 resulted in the loss of three fine fisherman and our thoughts remain with the families of Martin Johnstone, Chris Morrison, Paul Alliston and surviving crew member, Lachlan Armstrong.
""We have fully cooperated with the MAIB inquiry and are committed to implementing the report's recommendations.

Meanwhile, medics say more than 20 civilians died when bombs dropped by the Iraqi air force hit a maternity and children's hospital in Falluja.
The city lies west of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since January 2014.
The violence comes after a top American general said the US should consider embedding American troops with Iraqi forces if progress was not made in the fight against IS.
Raymond Odierno, the army's outgoing chief of staff, told reporters that such forces would have a support rather than a combat role.
Thursday's bomb attack in Sadr City was one of the deadliest in the capital since Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi took office a year ago.
In a statement posted on Twitter, IS said the truck bomb targeted Shia militiamen from the Mahdi Army and the Popular Mobilisation forces, who have been battling the jihadist group in northern and western Iraq for more than a year.
Sadr City has been the target of several bomb attacks this year claimed by IS militants, who consider Shia to be heretics.
Dozens of people have been killed in bombings across Baghdad in recent months. In May and July, large car bombs exploded outside two prominent hotels.
IS also continues to control vast swathes of territory in northern and western Iraq, but air strikes by a US-led coalition have helped Iraqi pro-government forces regain some territory since last August.

499,"Andrew Haldane said in a speech he was downbeat over the UK economy because of weaker global growth, low wage growth and financial and political risks.
""Put in rather plainer English, I am gloomier,"" Mr Haldane said.
""This implies interest rates could remain lower for longer, certainly than I had expected three months ago.""
Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US.
Previously, UK interest rates had been expected to rise early next year.
Mr Haldane made his remarks at a speech to local business leaders in Kenilworth, where he described the UK's economy as ""writhing in both agony and ecstasy"".
He said there were still plenty of reasons to be cheerful. Growth is set to be the fastest of any major economy this year and inflation and borrowing costs are low, he said.
However, he said the ""reasons to be fearful"" included productivity and wages, which had not risen.
""If there is genuine uncertainty about the path of the economy, the optimal policy response may be to avoid the worst outcomes,"" said Mr Haldane.
Sterling dropped 0.5% against the dollar following his remarks. Share trading on the London market has been volatile.
Mr Haldane's caution about global economic prospects were echoed by the Chancellor, George Osborne, who told the BBC that the worldwide economy was ""more unstable than it has been for some time"".
Mr Osborne would not comment on Mr Haldane's remarks. But he said there were ""a lot of global risks out there at the moment"" affecting the international economy.
""Interest rates are entirely a matter for the independent Bank of England, the monetary policy committee there,"" Mr Osborne said.
He added: ""I'll say this about the economy more generally - there are clearly a lot of global risks out there at the moment - we see these problems in the European economy, we've got this horrific disease Ebola in West Africa, all the problems in the Middle East and in the Ukrainian border.
""The global economy is more unstable than it has been for some time. That is all the more reason why in the UK we have to stick to the stability we have won.""
He said it was important to ""make sure Britain is well protected as we're in these stormy international economic waters"".

500,"They have trained wild monitor lizards, known locally as goannas, not to eat the toxic amphibians.
They did this by feeding the reptiles small, less potent cane toads. Many that tried the toads once did not make the same mistake again.
The researchers say that extending the trial could help the continent's wildlife.
The study is published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters.
Lead researcher Georgia Ward-Fear, from the University of Sydney, said: ""We've been very surprised by the results, by the amount of time that some of these lizards have actually retained this knowledge and survived in the presence of a high-density of cane toads, which is basically unheard of in the wild.""
Cane toads were introduced to Australia in the 1930s to control sugar cane pests.
But the subsequent spread has been unstoppable, devastating the continent's animals.
Among the hardest hit are the yellow-spotted monitors (Varanus panoptes).   Their population is estimated to have plummeted by 90%.
When the toads invade a new area, these yellow-and-black-spotted reptiles feast on the amphibians, and subsequently die.
""A goanna only has to mouth a toad for less than 30 seconds and it can kill them,"" said Dr Ward-Fear.
""This species is quite abundant in ecosystems ahead of a cane toad invasion, and then as we see the invasion move through, they are basically wiped out of the landscape.""
In the trials, the researchers tracked down wild lizards before the toads descended.
Dr Ward-Fear explained: ""We presented them with a small toad via our very technical apparatus: a telescopic fishing pole. The toad had a little cotton belt attached to it.
""We sidled up to the goanna in a very stealthy manner and extended the fishing pole.""
The young toads made the lizards sick, but were not toxic enough to do lasting harm.
The scientists then attached radio transmitters to follow the goannas as the amphibians arrived in the area.
Many of the 16 lizards who'd already tasted toad did not make the same mistake again - and more than half survived during the 18-month study period.
The team also followed 31 ""untrained"" lizards that had not eaten the toads.
""We saw the goannas that had not had a negative experience with the small toad died very quickly. They all died within three months of the natural cane toad invasion arriving at the site. At the end of the study, every untrained goanna had died.""
The scientists say the study suggests goannas have the ability to learn from experience and retain that knowledge over a long period of time.
Dr Ward-Fear said: ""This study provides the proof of principle that this strategy could be very effective. Employing it in the wild could potentially have a really large positive impact on the goanna population.""

Do you get your business done early, or drag it out until the last minute? What tricks of the trade can an agent use? How do you keep your player happy? What kind of clauses/add-ons go into a contract?
BBC Sport spoke to David Seligman, an agent at CM Sports in Manchester and an expert in sports law, and renowned agent Eric Hall for some insight into the type of last-ditch negotiations that occur when the transfer window is about to shut.
Seligman currently represents a number of Football League players while Hall's client list once included the likes of England internationals Dennis Wise, Tim Sherwood and Neil Ruddock.
""If it gets to deadline day, you know there isn't any time for the club to go and get somebody else, so the price goes up and you get them the better deal,"" says Seligman.
""If you talk to your Harry Redknapps, Alex Fergusons and Terry Venables, they won't wait until deadline day if they fancy a player,"" says Hall. ""Deadline day just gives people like me and the players extra ammunition.
""On deadline day, you just go 'chat, chat, chat, chat'. Keep them chatting until you're near to that deadline hour and then they will give you anything, within a certain reason, that you want. Ask for everything because as silly as some stuff may sound, you'll probably get it.
""I remember quite a few years ago, I took Kenny Sansom from Arsenal to Jim Smith and Newcastle and I got three times more than I probably should have got.""
Seligman adds: ""I negotiated a lower league player's release from his contract at one club in January and we were offered £5,000 to cancel his contract two days before the window closed.
""We waited and one hour before the window closed I got him double that. We were playing a game of chicken - we kept saying we wouldn't accept it - and it went down to the wire and the price went up.""
""It's all about assessing who has the power - the club or the player,"" says Seligman. ""I once represented a player who had not scored a goal for a long time but he had played at a high level so, in his head, he wanted to earn a certain amount of money.
""I eventually got him £2,500 a week after one club had initially offered £700 a week. He got a £10,000 signing on fee, too. From my point of view, when I first touted the player to the manager concerned, he was very interested. I gauged that by the fact he rang me back 25 minutes later after he'd done some digging and watched some videos.
""He said there and then there would be an email with a contract offer within the hour. At that point, I knew I had the power - he was the club's number one target.""
""When you're dragging it out a little bit, that's where an agent really has to earn his corn,"" says Seligman. ""You have to find the right balance between keeping the player happy and making sure the deal is not lost.
""A conversation needs to be had with the player on how far they want to push it, because it's their career. If you get to a point where the player says they don't want to push it too far, then you have to agree and take the deal that's on the table.
""This is where a good agent and a bad agent are separated because if you're a good agent, you are able to analyse the situation and use your contacts in the game to see if a club is speaking to other players and get the player to trust you.
""You don't want to lose a deal, but you don't want to cave too early.""
""There's no point in being underhand,"" says Seligman. ""You play them off against each other by being honest. If they think another club is interested it can ramp the wages up.""
Hall recalls: ""I took Tim Sherwood up to Blackburn a few years ago. The same day, I was doing a deal with Derby where Arthur Cox wanted to sign Tim (who was at Norwich at the time).
""I was playing games with my lovely mate [then Rovers manager] Kenny Dalglish and I kept him hanging on. You play one against the other. But if you're good at your job, you shouldn't play too many games. You mustn't underestimate chairmen either because most have the money to buy a club because they are good businessmen. They are not idiots.""
""Another trick is to say the deal if off by saying the offer is unacceptable,"" says Seligman. ""Or you can bring a player's family into it and say the player can't justify the travel because he's got a young family, and then the club say they'll put him up in a flat and help out with that. If the club really want the player it is important to not only look after him but his family too.
""Conversely, I had a player last summer who was offered 50% more than what he was earning at the time elsewhere but he turned it down because his girlfriend couldn't move. That's just the real world - she couldn't move in her line of work.""
""I had one player who wouldn't take a second year at a club because he thought he would get a bigger move and earn more money elsewhere - on the advice of his wife,"" recalls Seligman. ""He got paid up after six months.
""I've had a lot of English lads who are small and they say to me they want to make it in Spain,"" says Seligman. ""'The game is better suited to me in Spain', 'my dad said it'd be better for me in Spain' but I tell them that if they are good enough to play professionally in Spain, they are good enough to play professionally in England.
""People don't like being told a few home truths, but as an agent you have to balance it. You're dealing with human beings who are temperamental and footballers can be more temperamental and egotistical than most.""
""It can be useful to use media stories and hype too,"" admits Seligman. ""If a player gets talked about a lot, whether it be on social media or in the press, there is more attention attracted to them.
""If you have a player who is spoken about a lot, you have people wanting to watch him. I had a player who was scouted by a Championship club (he eventually signed for another Championship club) because there were just so many people talking about him and they didn't want to miss out. You have to create that 'don't want to miss out' philosophy.
""I've put out stories before now saying that my client has been watched by three or four clubs in a higher division because (a) it's true and (b) it raises their profile.""
""I've already told my players to build up their Twitter following over the next few months and when it comes to negotiations, we can get clauses built in there,"" says Seligman.
""If you're a player at a club and you're always giving away your boots, shirts and signed stuff, the fans will love you. Becoming a fans' favourite gives you more power, it helps when you're negotiating a new contract.
""Also, you can go to a club on a commercial level and say 'Look, I've got 20,000 followers on Twitter and you can put promotions out via my Twitter feed. That can aid the club, and in return I want an extra £100 a week.' That's a more innovative term in a contract.
""If you have two identical players and you're not sure which one to choose but there's one who you can make more money out of commercially, social media is a new way of doing that,"" adds Seligman.
""We've seen financial analysts and pundits justifying high transfer fees and wages for Gareth Bale at Real Madrid and David Beckham at LA Galaxy by the amount of shirts they sell. It's that but on a smaller scale. It's all about making more money.""
""I had a player called Richard Duffy, who was on loan at Coventry from Portsmouth,"" says Hall. ""His loan was due to finish about a week before the deadline and then I got a call from Coventry.
""They said they wanted to keep my player until the end of the season. I said 'That's great, if Portsmouth agree, but I want three times more for his wages, plus this, that, a car and a little house for him to live with his girlfriend.'
""Because it was a couple of days before the window was going to shut, and Coventry were struggling at the time, they came up with it.""
Seligman adds: ""A lot of the time, I get my client a relocation fee or expenses. I use a guy who is really good at relocating players. He sources everything like schools, nurseries… whatever is necessary. Anything which makes a player comfortable should, in theory, make him play better.""
""The things that tend to work well for my clients are to get things like performance bonuses worked into the contract,"" says Seligman. ""You can get a goal bonus - £100 per goal, £200 per goal, etc, or 10 goals can earn you £1,000. Clubs prefer that - to do it per five, 10 or 15 goals - but as an agent I'm not a fan of that.
""I had a big argument with a chairman at a Conference club once. He proposed my client got a £2,000 bonus if he got 20 goals - £100 a goal really - but I said I didn't like that because if he scores 19 goals and gets 10 assists you're going to be delighted with him but he won't get his bonus.
""His reply was that he'd sort something out but that wasn't good enough - it's all well and good saying that in August, it needs to be in the contract.""
Hall recalled: ""I remember saying to Terry Venables [on one particular deadline day] that I wanted my player to get £5,000 if he scores a goal. He was a goalkeeper!""",How do you get a player the best deal on transfer deadline day?,30923145,"In the world of sports agency, agents use various tactics and strategies to negotiate better deals for their clients, including playing hard to get, creating media hype, and incorporating performance bonuses into contracts, all with the aim of maximizing their clients' earnings and power in the negotiations.",0,"Article: {}

506,"Revised growth estimates now suggest the construction industry shrank in the first quarter of 2012, but by less than previously thought.
Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean the overall economy narrowly avoided falling into recession for a second time.
The ONS is due to give official confirmation of this in June.
The revised figures show the construction sector shrank by 5% in the first three months of 2012, less than the 5.4% contraction initially reported.
The ONS gives its final estimates for growth in June, and if other parts of the economy remain unchanged, the economy as a whole would register zero growth, rather than a contraction of 0.1%.
The economy needs to register two consecutive quarters of negative growth to be in recession.

However, the ONS may also revise the growth of other parts of the economy when it publishes its final estimates in June, such as the much larger services sector, which may offset the gains in construction.
Construction accounts for less than 7% of the UK economy, whereas the services sector makes up about three quarters of output.
Despite this, the construction sector's weakness has been blamed for dragging down economic growth.
The ONS figures showed that construction output fell again in the first three months of this year, reaching its lowest level in 15 years.

Hugh Tomlinson QC told the court his client, singer Charlotte Church, had not reached an agreement. The case involving her and her parents is due to start at the end of the month.
By Clive ColemanBBC News legal correspondent
This latest round of settlements represents a continued waving of the white flag by News International in the civil cases for breach of privacy arising out of the phone hacking at the former News of the World.
The vast majority of the original 60-odd cases have now been settled. And the more they settle, the more difficult it becomes for News International to defend one.
The case brought by the singer Charlotte Church and her family is due for trial, as are five other cases.  Whether any of them will actually get there seems doubtful.
The settlement sums reflect the level of hacking, the period over which it took place and the number of articles that were written based upon the information hacked.
But this is not even the beginning of the end. Waiting in the wings, are around 800 additional potential claimants, perhaps more. News International seems to be in for a very long and very costly act of surrender.
Speaking outside the High Court, Mr Coogan said he had taken the action to expose the way in which parts of the press had been operating.
""Like other people who sued, I was determined to do my part to show the depths to which the press can sink in pursuit of private information.
""The police and the Leveson Inquiry will be investigating these matters but at the time, when these civil cases began, News International seemed likely to succeed in covering up the hacking scandal completely.
""Neither the police nor the government were willing to hold those responsible accountable for unlawful acts.""
He said some of the phone hacking victims were ""many ordinary members of the public, sometimes vulnerable people with the most tenuous connection to news"".
Mr Campbell said he would be using the settlement to make donations to organisations, including the Labour Party and Mind, ""so that at least some small good for the causes I believe in can come out of the criminality and cultural depravity of others"".
""For me, this has been about people with a voice and a platform using them to change the media culture which, as I argued at the Leveson Inquiry, has become putrid in parts,"" he said.
The announcement of the latest settlements, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews.
Mr Campbell said his settlement was a ""satisfactory outcome"" and NGN had agreed to search for other documents and that he may be entitled to further damages.
Details of the effect hacking had on Mr Gascoigne were given in a statement from his solicitor.
The judge was told the former England international footballer, who also played for Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, had been the subject of a number of News of the World articles over many years and had ""considerable concerns"" about the source of some of the ""intrusive and private"" information.
The statement said: ""Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being obtained by bugging or tapping his telephone conversations, as a result of which he was accused of being paranoid.
""In addition, Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being given to the News of the World by his friends or family, as a result of which he fell out with several of his friends and family.""
The statement said the ex-footballer apologised for wrongly accusing those close to him of leaking information.
Those receiving settlements include:
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Mr Hughes said the practice of hacking was ""criminal behaviour on an industrial scale.""
He added: ""We must now make sure that nothing like this can ever happen again.""
These latest developments mean 15 more phone hacking cases have now been settled, including nine of the 10 which were due to go to civil trial on Monday. There were 37 other claims settled with NGN last month.
The announcement, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews.
Another five phone-hacking cases are still due to be heard.
Those are of model Elle Macpherson's former adviser Mary Ellen Field, footballer Ryan Giggs, former royal butler Paul Burrell, police officer Jacqui Hames and her husband David Cook, and PR consultant Nicola Phillips.","Comedian Steve Coogan and ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne are among the latest people to have settled claims for damages over phone-hacking, the High Court has heard.",16946105,"News Group Newspapers (NGN) has settled a further 15 phone hacking cases, including those of comedian Chris Gascoigne, Labour Party member Simon Hughes, and former football player George Best's agent Phil Hughes, with the total number of settled cases now approaching 50; the settlement amounts reflect the severity of the hacking and the number of articles published, but the cases represent a significant blow to NGN's defense against the ongoing civil lawsuits.",1,"Article: {}

Van Dijk headed a corner a fraction wide and Celtic captain Scott Brown broke off from his midfield tussles with Jamie Hamill and Sammy Clingan to fire a few shots at Brennan's goal but they were bravely blocked by defenders.
And Mubarak Wakaso thumped a header straight into Brennan's arms from the corner of the six-yard box.
Gordon's only real save of the first half was to parry a 25-yard pile-driver by Eremenko.
Pascali, who had been the key figure in organising the Killie defence, was lucky when referee Willie Collum awarded him rather than Guidetti a free-kick after making a mess of ushering the ball out for a goal kick with the Swede snapping at his heels.
But the Italian offered little complaint when Collum flashed him a straight red for his panicked challenge on Scepovic.
Killie boss Allan Johnston immediately withdrew Eremenko and sent on Lee Ashcroft to partner Mark Connolly in defence but within seconds Guidetti had stroked his free-kick past the despairing Brennan.
Celtic had Killie on the back foot and the visitors had a close shave when Connolly headed an effort off the line and Brennan saved well from a Stefan Johansen crack from 18 yards.
As the Rugby Park men struggled to play in Celtic's half, so the chances came for the hosts.
Brennan palmed away an angled shot by Scepovic, relied on his post to keep out a Guidetti effort from 12 yards and was well placed, again, to block the centre-forward's effort 10 seconds later.
But the Serbia international would get the last laugh over Brennan, who was in for the injured Craig Samson.
Moments after side-footing horribly wide from 18 yards as Wakaso found space on the left, Scepovic was rewarded for his persistence when he met the winger's cross to hit the ball across Brennan and into the net.
Celtic manager Ronny Deila replaced the scorer with Leigh Griffiths and sent on Charlie Mulgrew for Johansen - but the match was over as a meaningful contest and Celtic were able to follow up Thursday's Europa League win over Astra by moving up to fourth in the Scottish Premiership, overtaking Kilmarnock in the process.

510,"HS2 Ltd, the company behind the rail link from London to northern England, last week said the redevelopment of the station would finish in 2033 - seven years later than planned.
Sir Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras, said those living nearby faced ""decades of blight"" from construction.
But the HS2 minister said the area would benefit from the redevelopment.
The first phase of HS2 will be between London and Birmingham and will be followed by a V-shaped section to Manchester and Leeds.
Euston is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse.
In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed that the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed.
They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033.
HS2 Ltd said the changes meant the construction would be less intense.
But speaking to the Commons on Tuesday, Sir Keir rejected that: ""We have had plans, amended plans and further amended plans for Euston.
""The only sensible plan is to abandon the project altogether.
""This plan, far from being an improvement on the other plans, is the worst of the lot and leaves my constituents with all of the pain and none of the gain.
""And I focus here particularly on the phased approach - it offers and sets up decades of blight with no assurance about when the project as a whole will be finished.""
HS2 Minister Robert Goodwill said Euston needed to experience the same regeneration as King's Cross-St Pancras, also in north London.
He said: ""Our Euston proposal is fully compatible with the redevelopment of the remaining Network Rail station and our proposals have been developed with Network Rail and (Transport for London).""
Replying to Sir Keir, Mr Goodwill said disruption for commuters also needed to be considered alongside disruption faced by residents.
He said reports suggesting there would be reductions in platform space were ""not correct"".
Mr Goodwill also said Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was ""very keen to see the resurrection of the Euston Arch"".
Euston Arch, which was built in the 1830s, stood at the front of the station until it was demolished in 1962 when the station was rebuilt.
He said: ""We think we know where the bits are, and indeed the Euston Arch Trust aims to reform the arch and it's for them to bring this forward through a local planning application, but we have a location in the new Euston Square Gardens for the arch to come forward.""","Plans to redevelop London Euston as part of the high-speed railway line HS2 should be scrapped, an MP has said.",34264322,"HS2 Ltd has announced that the redevelopment of Euston station in London will be completed in 2033, seven years later than originally planned, with changes to the original plans including the delay of five additional platforms within the existing station, but local MP Sir Keir Starmer has rejected the proposal and expressed concerns about the impact on residents and commuters.",0,"Article: {}

Although that and 20 other allegations out of 31 were not upheld, the independent investigation did find he died of hospital-induced pneumonia.

Results of the review show nine of her allegations were entirely upheld and one partially.
But 17 were rejected, 11 were not upheld due to insufficient evidence and two were rejected because of insufficient information.
A second independent review is now taking place to examine the findings.
Among the upheld allegations in the report were responses to the following comments by Ms Clwyd:

Other allegations not accepted included ""almost every request I made was ignored or dismissed"" and ""I saw a nurse in the corridor and asked her why my husband wasn't in intensive care. She just said, 'There are lots worse than him'"".
Up until now, the results of the investigation - carried out a year ago - went unpublished.
But parts of the report were released under a Freedom of Information request.
Ms Clwyd told BBC Wales the report summary should not have been made public, especially while another investigation is under way. She disputed there was insufficient evidence for her claims, and said she had additional evidence.
She said: ""I think that when the other investigation is concluded then my views will be substantially vindicated.""
By Tomos LivingstoneBBC Wales political correspondent
This case has led to a huge political row.
We ended up with the extraordinary situation of a Labour MP, Ann Clwyd, being criticised by the Labour First Minister, Carwyn Jones, for failing, in his view, to provide evidence to back up her claims.
At the same time, we recently had the Welsh Conservative Party conference in Llangollen and delegates there standing and applauding Ann Clwyd for the work she had done campaigning for better standards of care in the health service.
There is a general election of course coming up next year - health care standards are already a central part of that campaign, not least perceived differences in standards between Wales and England.
So we are going to hear a lot more about the political row this case has caused and we are going to hear a lot more about the individual case itself, I think, with a second investigation now on its way.
The health board has denied breaching confidentiality and said the details released were statements already in the public domain.
A health board spokesman said: ""We would like to make quite clear that the health board has not released the full report and it is not our intention to breach any confidentiality.
""The investigation into Ms Clywd's concerns was overseen by an expert independent panel and completed in April 2013. Since then the health board has received a number of requests under Freedom of Information legislation to release that report. As part of that standard process Ms Clwyd's permission was sought to release the full report but that was refused.""
The spokesman said it sought legal advice before releasing the summary.
He said: ""Based on that advice the health board believes it would be in breach of its statutory duty not to release the summary report.""
The release of the report summary follows a dispute between Ms Clwyd and the Labour Welsh government.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has told Assembly Members the MP provided ""unattributable"" comments about the NHS that ""can't be investigated"".
But Ms Clwyd insisted she had provided Mr Jones with a comprehensive summary of complaints raised.

515,"The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land.
Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere.
The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires.
""Pines are well adapted to fire today,"" said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada.
""The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree.""
The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry.
""It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out,"" Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News.
""They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there.""
The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland.
Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily.
They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed.
Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires.
""One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet,"" explained Dr Falcon-Lang.
""These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees.""
Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens.
He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.

Last year, the scheme's budget was cut in order for cash to go to the NHS.
But the Labour-run Welsh government said this had not affected the scheme which had hit all its targets. Criticism has followed the closure.
Chancellor George Osborne from the Conservative party, said the decision to temporarily close the scheme pointed to ""confusion"" within labour after party leader Ed Miliband had said he wanted the programme to be rolled out across the country.
Campaigning in the Vale of Glamorgan, Mr Osborne said: ""I remember the Labour party urging me to take this scheme across the whole of the UK.  Now they are cutting it in Wales.
""What it points to is real confusion in the Labour party. They don't really have a clear plan for Wales and I think Wales as a result would suffer with lost jobs, lost investment.""
Other parties also criticised the decision with Jenny Willott, for the Liberal Democrats, saying Jobs Growth Wales had been ""ineffective"".
""However, for the Welsh Labour Government to allow this scheme to expire without replacing it is staggering,"" she said.
And Ian Johnson, a Plaid Cymru election candidate, added: ""Earlier this year, Ed Miliband said how great the scheme was.
""Today, he has been embarrassed by his only government in the UK, who have fundamentally undermined his election pledge to young people.""
Meanwhile, UKIP's leader in Wales Nathan Gill called on ministers to ""focus on creating the right conditions for existing businesses to expand and for new businesses to start"".
""The only way we will ever truly achieve this is to withdraw from the European Union, which spends each day dreaming up new ways of stifling innovation and creativity in the form of regulations and directives,"" he said.
But the Welsh government said it was aiming to launch a new Jobs Growth Wales programme in May saying it has made a ""significant contribution to reducing youth unemployment right across Wales"".
""The original programme was designed to create and fill 12,000 jobs and to date it has helped create over 17,000 job opportunities and fill almost 15,000 of these vacancies for young people aged 16-24,"" a spokesperson said.
""The European Social Fund budget for the 2007-2013 programme came to an end on 31 March and we have already begun work on the successor programme.
""Subject to approval within the new European Social Fund for 2014-2020 we are aiming to launch the new Jobs Growth Wales programme in the first quarter of this financial year.""
The thrust of the criticism here is that if Jobs Growth Wales is so important to the Welsh economy then how come it has been allowed to come to a halt, albeit temporarily, and how come funding has been reduced?
The opposition parties have seized on developments partly because barely a week goes by without a member of the Welsh government trumpeting the success of its back-to-work scheme.

Solutions were found on issues over paramilitarism and welfare reform.
But Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said a lack of consensus over how to deal with the past was a let-down to police and Troubles victims' families.
DCC Harris said an extra Â£160m of government funding to tackle dissident republicans that was agreed in the deal was much needed.
He added the agreement's initiatives to tackle paramilitarism and organised crime were also positive.
But a proposed new independent Historical Investigations Unit, which would have taken on the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) responsibility for outstanding Troubles murder investigations, has not yet been approved.
DCC Harris said: ""We are on record as saying the formation of a Historical Investigations Unit would provide an opportunity for a more structured and coherent approach to dealing with the past, allowing the PSNI to concentrate primarily on keeping people safe today.""
He said that in absence of that body the PSNI would have to ensure its ""finite resources are used in the most effective manner"".
""We must balance keeping people safe today with our continued duties in relation to the past.
""The reality is the financial challenges facing us will continue to have a direct impact on how we respond to the demands of the past and the pace at which those demands can be serviced.""

""It is not good enough to build up hopes for the most comprehensive set of proposals yet to address victims' and survivors' needs and then fail to deliver.""

""She was found standing on a road outside a gurudwara (Sikh temple) in Janakpuri area in west Delhi,"" Jhanvi's uncle Gaurav Chopra told the BBC.
""She had a little board hanging around her neck. It gave her name and her father's name. It said she was lost at India Gate and asked anyone who found her to call her father. The board had my mobile phone number written on it.""
Mr Chopra said he asked the caller, a teenager, to sit with the child while he drove to the area.
""The people who had taken her had shaved her head but I immediately recognised her. I started crying, she also started crying. I gave her some chocolates. She looked a little tense, but she was fine and in good health.""
Mr Chopra took her to the police station where Jhanvi's parents also arrived and identified her.
Her father Rakesh Ahuja told reporters that it was like ""a rebirth of a daughter"".
It is not yet known who took away the child but police say they suspect her kidnappers panicked and abandoned her following a widespread media coverage of the case and the social media campaign.

A sheriff told the 54-year-old, from Falkirk, that ""women should be able to walk without fear"" in public places.
He was also placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years.
A previous hearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court was told that Trotter travelled into Edinburgh daily by train to go to work.
On Monday 29 September, a fellow passenger noted him walking in ""a curious, a sinister manner"" at Waverley Station, ""clearly making an effort to get very close to a female ahead of him"" on the escalator.
Fiscal depute Aidan Higgins, prosecuting, told the court that ""it was clear he was using his phone to get under the lady's skirt, taking photographs"".
The commuter reported his concerns to British Transport Police and Trotter was identified from CCTV footage. He was detained as he left the station the following day.
Examination of Trotter's phone and his home computer established that he had been using his mobile on various days between 11 June and 29 September, with 22 videos showing the camera had been directed under women's skirts.

529,"The popular game for mobile devices was removed from online stores on Sunday by its Vietnamese creator, who said its fame ""ruins my simple life"".
Dong Nguyen, who created the game in just two to three days, was making as much as $50,000 (Â£30,482) a day from the game's advertising revenue.
In several Twitter posts, he said the game's removal was not due to legal issues and that he may make a sequel.
Mr Dong, who describes himself as a ""passionate indie game maker"", also said on the micro-blogging site that he will not sell Flappy Bird but that he will still make games.
Flappy Bird has been downloaded more than 50 million times, making it this year's most popular mobile game so far.
Launched in May 2013, the game was free to download and required players to tap the screen to keep the bird in flight.
Despite its simple graphics, Flappy Bird was a notoriously difficult game since many users could only keep the bird in the air for a few seconds before it hits an obstacle and falls.
The game went viral after being promoted almost entirely by social media users and was reviewed on a YouTube channel by more than 22 million subscribers.
The official version was only available for Apple and Android devices. It quickly became the number one free game in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store charts.
Several news sites had noted the similarity between the game and an earlier title called Piou Piou, by a different French developer, as well as the fact that Flappy Bird's main character and obstacles resembled the Cheep-Cheep birds and green pipes found in Nintendo's Super Mario Bros series.
Forbes had even suggested that Mr Dong could be sued for intellectual property infringement as a result. However, the developer has stated that his decision to pull the title was ""not anything related to legal issues"".
After Mr Dong took the game down, many fans turned to social media to petition for its return.
On Twitter, there were widely-used hashtags of #RIPFlappyBird and #SaveFlappyBird, with several ""Save Flappy Bird"" accounts being spawned as well.
The game is no longer available through online stores, but it still works on phones that had previously downloaded it.
As a result, some online users have offered to sell their smartphones still containing the Flappy Birds app for large sums of money.
However, some fans expressed their relief that the game was gone.
One user describes Flappy Birds as ""an addictive game that everyone hates to love"" while another said, ""I think it's for the best, and for the best of all the cracked phones out there.""

530,"By law, he must stand down as president in 2013, having completed two consecutive terms as president of the former Soviet republic.
However, his years in office have marked Georgia for years to come.
To some he will always be the hero of the Rose Revolution, sweeping away Soviet-style corruption and courting the West.
To others, he is the leader who rashly sparked a dangerous war with Russia.
Mr Saakashvili's background has all the ingredients of a successful career on the international stage and helps explain his appeal to Brussels and Washington.
Born in 1967 in the Georgian capital Tbilisi to a doctor father and a historian mother, he did his Soviet military service in Ukraine, where he went on to study international law.
Receiving a fellowship from the US state department, he attended Columbia University law school and was hired by a New York-based law firm.
In addition to his native Georgian, he speaks English, French, Ukrainian and Russian.
He and his Dutch wife, human rights specialist Sandra Elisabeth Roelofs, have two sons.
Returning to Georgia from his career abroad, he was appointed justice minister in October 2000 by the then President, Eduard Shevardnadze.
But he resigned the following year, saying he considered it immoral to remain a member of a government plagued by corruption and cronyism.
After forming an opposition party, the National Movement, he was elected head of Tbilisi city council where he built up a power base.
Discontent with Mr Shevardnadze grew steadily and when parliamentary elections in November 2003 were tainted by allegations of fraud, Mr Saakashvili organised daily protests.
The Rose Revolution culminated in the bloodless storming of the Georgian parliament and Mr Shevardnadze's resignation. In January 2004, Mr Saakashvili was elected president of his country with 96% of the vote, at the tender age of 37.
""I'm not pro-American or pro-Russian - I am pro-Georgian,"" the new president said in his inaugural speech.
However, it rapidly became clear that he meant to take Georgia out of Moscow's orbit, by joining Nato no less.
Relations between Georgia and its giant neighbour rapidly deteriorated, as Tbilisi pressed for the return of its breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which had allied themselves with Russia.
Meanwhile, President Saakashvili cemented his reputation as a Western ally by committing Georgian troops to the Nato-led coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Ill-feeling between Tbilisi and Moscow erupted into open war in August 2008, after Georgia made a lightning military assault on South Ossetia, where Russia kept a peacekeeping force.
Russian troops struck back rapidly, driving out President Saakashvili's soldiers and pushing into Georgia.
While they stopped short of a full invasion and eventually withdrew back into South Ossetia, the Russians had humiliated the Georgian leader.
Not only did Georgia's chances of regaining its territories look even more remote but its Nato ambitions were badly damaged, since a condition for membership of the alliance is the absence of territorial disputes.
Mr Saakashvili had already been re-elected as president before the war, although his share of the vote in January 2008 was sharply down, at 53%.
Internal political opposition to his rule has grown - a development that might be welcomed as a sign that a healthy democracy is taking root in Georgia.
However, Mr Saakashvili's opponents accuse him of exhibiting the very authoritarianism of which he has accused Kremlin leaders.
During huge street protests against alleged political corruption in 2007, his government used police to disperse demonstrators and declared a temporary state of emergency.
Protests demanding the president's resignation ended in bloodshed in 2011, and 2012 saw mass rallies in Tbilisi in protest at prison abuse, prompting Mr Saakashvili's interior minister to resign.
The prison scandal was a particularly sensitive issue for the president as he has made much of his law and order policies, eradicating much of the corruption that used to mar everyday life.
Critics also accuse Mr Saakashvili, the economic liberal, of having failed to tackle poverty. Although per capita GDP has nearly doubled since he took power it remains a fraction of that of Russia or Estonia.
Under his rule, Georgia's external debt has grown while direct foreign investment has been uneven, a recent report by the Carnegie Endowment found.
In his defence, Mikheil Saakashvili took power at a time when Georgia looked like becoming a failed state.
Perhaps the biggest test of his credentials as a statesman will be how he handles the transition to his successor as president.","Despite military humiliation and sharp criticism of his human rights record, Mikheil Saakashvili has managed to maintain a strong grip on Georgia.",19740960,"Mikheil Saakashvili, the former President of Georgia, has been a controversial figure in Georgian politics, known for his authoritarian tactics and aggressive foreign policy, while also implementing some successful reforms and earning international praise.",0,"Article: {}

533,"Africa will go through six human actions this year - it will stand, kneel, squat, bow, fall and then rise again.
Here's how.
In the group of those who will be standing in Africa in 2017 is Donald Trump.
Yes, I know it's an act of treason to associate him with Africa.
But when he's sworn in as president, his foreign policy (or tweetplomacy) will have a bearing on our continent.
His critics warn that his isolationist stand might mean less attention will be paid to Africa.
But it could just force Africans to find solutions from within, by strengthening our institutions, improving infrastructure, governance and security and trading more amongst ourselves.
Another man who also takes office in January is Nana Akufo-Addo, the president-elect of Ghana.
He's tried to enter Flagstaff House (the presidential residency) through the ballot box as the New Patriotic Party candidate since 2008.
Now that he has the keys, Ghanaians will wait to see how he delivers his pledge of one district, one factory, lest he becomes one man, one term.
And then there's the state of emergency in Ethiopia, which still stands.
It was put in place last October following violent protests.
The government says the security situation has improved save for some clashes in the northern part of Amhara region.
Some 9,000 people detained under the state of emergency have been released and the government says it could lift the emergency before its six-month period is over.
There are two prominent men who will be kneeling before voters to ask for a job.
Paul Kagame has been president for the last 16 years, but Rwandans appear to want more of him and have voted to remove the term-limit barrier.
In August, Mr Kagame will therefore use his constitutional right to ask for a new employment contract.
In the same month, his Kenyan neighbour Uhuru Kenyatta will also be reapplying for his job.
Last September, while warning the main opposition leader Raila Odinga to mind his own party and leave the ruling Jubilee party alone, President Kenyatta famously said: ""â€¦ as you continue to search for a seat and salivate, we are feasting on the meat"".
It will be clear in August whether Kenyans will give Jubilee more time to feast or turn the party itself into mince meat.
Joseph Warungu:
""The Nigerian economy... enters 2017 in the squat position""
The African Union has been searching for a new Chief Executive Officer and will fill the position in January.
Three men and two women from Botswana, Kenya, Chad, Senegal and Equatorial Guinea will fight it out to replace the outgoing South African Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, as Chair of the AU Commission.
Now to some situations and people who can't decide whether to stand or sit.
The Nigerian economy has caught its nastiest stomach bug in more than two decades.
And so it enters 2017 in the squat position.
A combination of factors including a crash in the global price of oil, which Nigeria relies a lot on, and a fall in the naira, the country's currency, contributed to the sizeable contraction of the economy in 2016.
The anger and frustration among the people was aptly captured by this online comment from one Nigerian in November: ""We are now going into depression and deep S***! Buhari has himself to blame for unfortunately being a gentleman!""
Over in The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh is no gentleman - he's chosen to squat at State House.
He lost the presidential election to Adama Barrow and publicly conceded defeat.
A little later, the thought of leaving the seat he has called his own for the last 22 years overpowered him and he changed his mind.
Africa and the world have asked him to go home, but he is defiant.
As his last day in office approaches on 19 of January, the same force he used to gain power in 1994 could be used to relieve him of his office.
There are three notable people who will be bowing out of office in 2017.
Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the first elected female head of state in Africa, is coming to the end of her second and final term of office in Liberia.
One of those waiting on the touchline to join the succession race is football star George Weah.
The former AC Milan and Chelsea striker failed to score in the 2005 presidential tournament but hopes 2017 will be his year.
Angolans will have a chance to replace the only man they've known as president for nearly 40 years.
Although Jose Eduardo dos Santos has announced he'll step down, his blood will still flow through the veins of power and the economy in Angola.
His daughter, Isabel, heads Sonangol, the state oil company and is considered by Forbes to be Africa's richest woman, while his son, Jose, is chairman of the country's sovereign wealth fund, Fundo Soberano de Angola.
In neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, 2017 could mark the beginning of the end for another family dynasty, which started in 1997 when Laurent Desire Kabila became president after overthrowing Mobutu Sese Seko.
Laurent Kabila's son Joseph picked up the reigns after his father's assassination in 2001, and was bent on staying in power until attempts to change the constitution to allow him a third term backfired.
Violent street protests have piled pressure on President Kabila to exit from office this year and the issue is bound to continue into the new year.
The theme of falling is alive in South Africa.
The #FeesMustFall campaign by university students sought to fight the rising cost of higher education and saw violent clashes between police and protesters, disruptions in the university calendar and the arrest of a number of students.
2017 promises more of the same because not only have the fees not fallen, some top universities have announced an 8% increase.
And then there's the question of the country's President Jacob Zuma.
In December 2017, his tenure as leader of the governing ANC party runs out, but his term as the country's president only ends in 2019.
Allowing Mr Zuma to continue as head of state but with the ANC under someone else's leadership could create two centres of power, which could be political suicide.
So will the ANC #LetZumaFall as it did President Thabo Mbeki under similar circumstances?
2017 will have answers.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) is another that could face the threat of falling in Africa if more African countries continue to withdraw from the Rome Statute.
A number of countries have notified the UN Secretary-General of their intention to withdraw, saying the ICC unfairly targets African leaders in its application of international justice.
And now to international trends where fashion, like history, has a habit of repeating itself.
A quick glance at catwalk signs for 2017 shows that the hems of women's skirts will be falling - to just below the knee.
Apparently midi-skirts elongate the figure and flatter the wearer, so this must be a good fall.
The Africa Cup of Nations tournament kicks off in mid-January in Gabon and Uganda carries the hopes of East Africa.
The region has a terrible record in continental football.
Uganda's last appearance in the finals was in 1978 when it lost to Ghana in the final.
Kenya and Tanzania have never progressed beyond the group stage, so if Uganda can rise, East Africa can stand tall.
In politics, despite all manner of socio-economic challenges, the spirit of the Africans is on the rise - they've already just about removed one long-serving president from power (The Gambia, even if he is still resisting ) and in 2017 a couple more might follow (DR Congo, Angola)
When Africa stumbles, it must rise because as they say in Nigeria, the sun shines on those who stand before it shines on those who are sitting.

A 127-page vetting document called Standard Form 86 may have been accessed. Among the questions potential employees are asked:
A White House statement said investigators had a ""high degree of confidence"" that background information on government employees had been accessed.
Joel Brenner, a former US counterintelligence official, called the data a ""gold mine"" for hackers.
It is also believed the breach of personal data of US government workers announced last week may be far larger than previously reported.
Initial estimates put the number of people potentially affected at four million, but officials close to the investigation told AP that as many as 14 million might be involved.
The US has said the hackers, thought to be behind both attacks, are believed to be based in China. Beijing called the claims ""irresponsible"".
The Obama administration meanwhile announced further measures to beef up cybersecurity on Friday.
""Recent events underscore the need to accelerate the administration's cyber strategy and confront aggressive, persistent malicious actors that continue to target our nation's cyber infrastructure,"" a White House statement said.","Hackers with suspected links to China appear to have accessed sensitive data on US intelligence and military personnel, American officials say.",33120405,"A potential second hack of the US government's Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has been revealed, which could potentially expose security personnel and their families to blackmail, after a major breach was reported last week, with officials believing the attackers may have accessed sensitive personal information submitted for security clearances, including financial history, personal details, and contact information for friends and relatives.",0,"Article: {}

The hospital was at the centre of a Â£6m public inquiry into care failings.
But despite the CQC's overall finding being critical, the trust said it was ""highly complimentary"" about the standard of care in some areas.
Inspectors visited County Hospital, formerly Stafford Hospital, and Royal Stoke University Hospital, also run by the trust, in April. They carried out unannounced inspections in May.

The NHS in Staffordshire was given almost Â£300m to create the new trust and relocate some services in the county.
The CQC said it recognised ""that the leadership of the new trust has had the significant task of bringing together two organisations at a challenging time. We have seen that progress has been made but there is still more to be achieved"".
The trust was rated as good overall for how caring its services were, but told it required improvement to ensure safe, effective and well-led services. It received an inadequate rating in relation to whether services were responsive.
Several initiatives within children and young people's services at Stoke were rated as outstanding in relation to whether they were caring.
Outstanding work was also seen in the specialised neurological unit at County Hospital, inspectors said.
But the trust was told it must address high waiting times in its emergency department, and inspectors noted the Royal Stoke had ""consistently and frequently failed the four-hour waiting time target"".
It also said the trust should review capacity and adequacy of critical care services, and communication between senior management and frontline staff.
Mark Hackett, trust chief executive, said: ""Less than a year ago there were serious concerns about the sustainability, and therefore the safety, of services at County Hospital, but the CQC has now given the hospital 23 good ratings and just one inadequate rating.""

539,"Research on 1,500 women aged 64 to 95 found those who spent many hours sitting and exercised for less than 40 minutes a day had cells that were biologically eight years older.
As people age, their cells age, causing DNA protectors to shorten and fray.
But health and lifestyle factors may speed up the process, researchers from California said.
Even in old age, it was important to keep active and avoid sitting for more than 10 hours a day, they said.
During ageing, tiny caps on the ends of DNA strands naturally shorten.
These telomeres - which have been likened to the plastic tips of shoelaces - are there to prevent chromosomes from deteriorating.
Telomere length is one indicator of biological age, which does not always match chronological age.
Shortened telomeres have been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and major cancers.
How much regular exercise people do now also appears to be a factor in their length.
To track the women's movements in the study, they wore wore an accelerometer on their right hip for seven days in a row, during the day and night.
They were also asked to complete questionnaires on their activity.
Dr Aladdin Shadyab, lead study author, from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, said: ""We found that women who sat for longer did not have shorter telomere length if they exercised for at least 30 minutes a day.
""Discussions about the benefits of exercise should start when we are young, and physical activity should continue to be part of our daily lives as we get older, even at 80 years old.""
The study is published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.
NHS Choices advises older adults to break up long periods of sitting with light activity because ""sedentary behaviour is now considered an independent risk factor for ill health"".
It says adults aged 65 or older who are generally fit and mobile should try to do:

540,"That is a harsh reflection on his playing career, though, because Simeone was a magnificent midfielder, winning 106 international caps and starring in Serie A for Inter Milan and Lazio as well as guiding Atletico to a league and cup double in 1996 (their most recent La Liga triumph).
And now, Simeone is carving a new career as one of the game's hottest managerial properties, with his approach to coaching mirroring the blend of winning attitude and technical aptitude that characterised his playing days.
If you asked Diego Simeone how his Atletico Madrid team have overcome all the odds to progress to the Champions League semi-finals, where they will face Jose Mourinho's Chelsea, as well as topping La Liga with just six games remaining, he would provide you with a simple answer: ""Hard work and humility.""
Indeed, that is exactly the mantra he has been preaching on a weekly basis this season, as the football world continues to wonder when - or if at all - his steamroller of a team will finally run out of puff.
Until recently, most people assumed it would simply be a matter of time. When, not if. But Wednesday's famous victory over Barcelona, where Atletico succeeded in knocking the Catalan team out of the Champions League before the last four for the first time since 2007, sent a loud and clear message: Atletico Madrid are for real.
To a great extent, Simeone's assessment of his Atletico team's greatest strengths - hard work and humility - is absolutely right.
Atletico were only four points above the La Liga relegation zone when Diego Simeone became coach in December 2011. Within 18 months he had guided them to the Europa League, Uefa Super Cup and Copa del Rey titles.
The discipline, intensity and sheer, uncompromising effort of their play is unrivalled. That was never more evident in the opening stages on Wednesday, when Atletico's whirlwind of attacking pressure simply blew Barcelona away, resulting in Koke netting the only goal of the game and David Villa thumping shots against the woodwork twice inside the opening 20 minutes.
Hard work and humility - as well as, to use Simeone's other favourite phrase, going from game to game - have allowed Atletico's bunch of largely unheralded journeymen, none of whom (with the exception of Villa) were superstars before they arrived at the Vicente Calderon, to barge their way without an invitation into the upper echelons of world football.
For any football fan who has become cynical about the modern game's tendency to be ruled by huge dollops of money, Atletico's unstoppable rise has been a breath of fresh air.
In the days of Arab sheikhs, Russian oligarchs and American business tycoons, low-budget teams like Atletico simply aren't supposed to do this well. Yet here they are, with less than six weeks of the season remaining, still in strong contention for the two most prestigious prizes on offer.
That is, indeed, largely down to the relentless work ethic instilled by Simeone. But it would be very wrong to suggest that Atletico's current success is simply down to the fact that they run around a lot, because there is also a huge amount of quality and intelligence within their ranks.
That starts on the training ground, where Simeone and his gruff assistant Mono Burgos prepare the perfect tactics to suit their team's strengths.
Under Simeone's instruction, Atletico are defensively disciplined, unsurpassably organised and play with great game awareness, knowing when to press ferociously in numbers and when to sit deep, waiting for the right opportunity to pounce upon their hapless opponents and launch a rapid, pinpoint counter-attack.
As the eloquent Argentine boss explained in the build-up to his team's latest triumph, Barcelona's strength lies in controlling possession; Atletico's lies in controlling space.
Simeone's attention to detail and his ability to clearly communicate his plans ensures that his players have mastered the art of playing the game where they want to, while simultaneously forcing their opponents into areas where they feel uncomfortable.
More than anything, though, Simeone's unbounding positivity and unshakeable belief that good habits, when consistently applied on a day to day basis, will lead to winning performances has succeeded in completely turning Atletico's image on its head.
For years, Madrid's second team suffered from a severe inferiority complex as neighbouring Real ruled the roost and the rest of Spain derided them as hapless bunglers who always managed to somehow mess everything up.
That reputation was most famously captured in a notorious television advert, when a forlorn young boy asked his frowning father: ""Porque somos del Atleti?"" Why are we Atleti fans? It was a sort of Spanish equivalent to ""Accrington Stanley…who are dey?"" and illustrated the inescapable sense of inevitable doom which habitually engulfed Atletico fans as they lurched from disaster to disaster.
Under Simeone, Atletico are finally shattering that conception; their manager is even an image of vibrant self-belief as he prowls the touchline during games, constantly turning to the crowd and vigorously urging them to applaud the players for their wholehearted effort.
When referee Howard Webb blew the final whistle at the Vicente Calderon on Wednesday, tremendous scenes of jubilation were unleashed, with the home fans - chanting and singing with a relentlessness almost matching their team - refusing to leave the shaking stadium until their heroes re-emerged from the tunnel to embark upon a celebratory lap of honour.
As the players finally gave way to those demands and dragged their weary bodies back onto the pitch, to be sportingly saluted even by the travelling Barcelona fans, one man was conspicuous by his absence. Diego Simeone was apparently nowhere to be seen.
But he was there all right, hiding on his own at the back of the dugout, quietly watching the scenes of celebration he had helped to create with obvious pride, seemingly struggling to force back tears. After the hard work, the humility.
Former Liverpool and Republic of Ireland forward Michael Robinson, who finished his playing career in Spain and is now the country's foremost television pundit, concluded his rhapsody over Atletico's performance by enthusing: ""It's impossible not to admire them.""
Robinson is exactly right. ""Why are we Atletico fans?"" Right now, the more pertinent question is why anyone wouldn't be.","In Britain, Argentine Diego Simeone is best remembered as the man whose reaction to a petulant kick by David Beckham resulted in the England star famously being sent off during a World Cup game in 1998.",26966304,"Diego Simeone, the manager of Atletico Madrid, has transformed the team from a underdog with a reputation for underachieving to a dominant force in Spanish football, thanks to his emphasis on hard work, humility, and tactical discipline.",0,"Article: {}

It said this was partly because it had not received security guarantees.
The port has also been targeted by warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition which is backing Yemen's government in its war with the rebel Houthi movement.
UN attempts to bring in five cranes to replace those damaged in the attacks have not been successful.
The ICRC's Middle East regional director Robert Mardini warned that Yemen, which depends on imports for 90% of its food supplies, was now living on its ""reserves"" and that the ""day will come very soon"" when they run out.
He said that despite the focus on the damage and casualties caused by the fighting, thousands of people were dying ""silently"" of complications due to malnutrition, or of minor illnesses or injuries which were not being treated at the 45% of health facilities that are still functioning.
The conflict, which escalated in March 2015, has left at least 7,500 people dead and 40,000 injured, according to the United Nations.
But almost 19 million people are in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.
Seven million people do not know where their next meal is coming from and more than three million, including 2.1 million children, are suffering from acute malnutrition.
The UN's emergency relief co-ordinator, Stephen O'Brien, called on the warring parties to guarantee more access to ports to let in food, fuel and medicine imports on Monday.
He told the BBC the situation was ""very desperate"", and that he had seen children so ""severely malnourished"" that he feared they would not survive another day.
Earlier this month, the UN appealed for $2.1bn (Â£1.7bn) to provide life-saving assistance to 12 million people in Yemen over the next year. But it has so far received only $43m.
On Tuesday, Mr O'Brien was forced to cancel a visit to the city of Taiz, which is besieged by rebel fighters, reportedly after his convoy came under fire.
In a separate development on Tuesday, UN human rights officials said they had evidence of the recruitment of child soldiers in Yemen, mostly by groups affiliated with the Houthis.

Official state channel Rossiya 1 TV said that while Kiev labelled the militia and protesters in the south-east as ""terrorists"", locals strongly disagreed. It showed some civilians insisting that they were not separatists.
""Kiev is threatening the citizens of Donetsk Region with psychological attacks from the air. Periodically, military helicopters and planes circle menacingly over the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk,"" Rossiya 1 TV said.
Another strand of coverage by Russia's three main TV channels, though, has been to portray the Ukrainian army as weak, disorganised and suffering from poor service conditions and low morale.
One report by NTV - owned by state gas giant Gazprom - reported that Ukrainian troops had refused to take orders from their commanders and sided with pro-Russian militiamen, a presenter for NTV reported.
""Many servicemen are clearly confused and don't understand how they could point their guns at Ukrainians, the same people as them,"" the channel's correspondent says.
Russian TV channels have also been showing footage of what they say are local people in Donetsk and Luhansk regions confronting Ukrainian troops. In one instance, locals are seen persuading the crew of a tank not to shoot at civilians. In another, they stop and loot a military truck.
In contrast, Ukrainian TV channels have been supportive of what they see as the Kiev authorities' efforts to rein in ''separatists'' and ""militants supported by Russia"".
Ukrainian TV channels say ""small groups"" of violent protesters demanding federalisation or annexation by Russia do not reflect the true sentiment of residents of eastern Ukraine most of whom, they say, want to live in an undivided Ukraine.
They have been broadcasting comments from ordinary people in the streets of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv, most of them saying they want their region to stay in Ukraine.
The demands of some Ukrainians for action against the separatists also feature heavily. State-owned UT1 TV provided live coverage of a rally in Kiev's Independence Square, where around 10,000 people demanded that the authorities act more resolutely to protect the eastern regions from ""Russian aggression"".
Ukraine's press, meanwhile, is full of doom-laden speculation about Russia's intentions.

He said the proposed plan came in response to Rhosddu residents' concerns over dumped hypodermic needles.
Mr Jones' comments come after a similar facility was recently announced for Glasgow.
The Glasgow centre, which will be the first of its kind in the UK, will aim to address the problems caused by users who inject on the city's streets.
Similar schemes already operate in 10 other countries, including Australia, Germany, France, Holland and Switzerland.
Mr Jones said: ""At the moment, all you're getting is the authorities treating the symptoms of substance abuse and drug addiction rather than the underlying causes.
""Drug addiction should be treated as a public health issue rather than as a criminal matter.""
If given the go-ahead, he said the rooms could also offer ""wrap around"" services such as health care, counselling, housing and welfare advice.
He said he also wanted to see a heroin-assisted treatment centre, which would see ""chaotic"" addicts prescribed medicinal heroin to help them beat their addiction.
He added this would also help tackle low-level street drug dealing.
Mr Jones said he was in discussion with members of Wrexham council about how such a project could work.
He added: ""This approach would be better for those suffering from the blight of addiction, society in general and the residents of Rhosddu in particular.

550,"Syed, 35, is serving a life sentence for the murder of Hae Min Lee in 1999.
His defence team is trying to reopen the case based on some of the questions raised in the Serial podcast over whether Syed had received a fair trial.
A judge in Baltimore has allowed lawyers to submit new evidence for the first time since his conviction.
Serial, which was released in weekly instalments at the end of last year, became a global hit, breaking records as the fastest podcast to reach five million downloads on iTunes.
In it, journalists went through every detail in the investigation into the death of Lee, for which her ex-boyfriend Syed was convicted. Apparent errors and possible new evidence were discovered by the Serial team, leading to calls for a new investigation.
Lawyers will now be allowed to present new evidence on two fronts: the reliability of mobile phone records and the testimony of a potential alibi.
In the 2000 trial, prosecutors relied heavily on mobile phone records that allegedly placed Syed at a park in Baltimore where Lee's body was buried. Syed, who was 17 at the time, has always maintained his innocence.
But a motion filed in court in August said a newly recovered mobile phone document showed ""the cell tower evidence was misleading and should have never been admitted at trial"".
The new hearing, a date for which has yet to be decided, will also hear evidence from a potential alibi for Syed.
Asia McClain, a friend of Syed's who was not heard in the original trial, claims to have seen him in a library at the time of the suspected killing.
The fact that Syed's first lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to submit this evidence in the original trial was one of the arguments used to win him the right to appeal in February.
Court papers show the hearing will also look at why Syed's defence team did not present Ms McLain as a witness and whether there was ""potential prosecutorial misconduct"" as a result.","Lawyers for Adnan Syed, the subject of the hit US podcast Serial, will be allowed to present new evidence in his case after a court ruling on Friday.",34753646,"A judge has allowed Syed's defense team to submit new evidence in his murder case, which was originally convicted based on mobile phone records and witness testimony, but new evidence has come to light through the Serial podcast, including a potential alibi and questions about the reliability of the mobile phone records.",0,"Article: {}

551,"He has frequently expressed his dislike of social media sites - including YouTube and Facebook - believing they are being used to attack him.
However, the Twitter ban has drawn widespread criticism, including from Turkish President Abdullah Gul who tweeted his disagreement.
But Mr Erdogan's troubles go far beyond social media. He is also facing allegations of corruption and is embroiled in a feud with a former ally.
Here's a look at some of the battles he is currently fighting.
Last month, an audio recording posted on an anonymous Twitter account appeared to show Mr Erdogan talking to his son about hiding large sums of money.
Mr Erdogan denounced it as a fake.
""I don't care what the international community says at all. Everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic,"" Mr Erdogan said on Thursday.
However, millions of Turkish internet users continued to access Twitter, using proxy servers and other means. Twitter itself posted instructions, while in Istanbul, graffiti appeared with details of how to sidestep the ban.
Many of the prime minister's harshest critics have used Twitter to co-ordinate protests against him and circulate damaging information.
A law passed last month tightens government controls on the internet, allowing the Turkish authorities to block websites without first seeking a court ruling.
It will also force internet providers to store data on web users' activities for two years and make it available to the authorities.
The opposition and human rights organisations have criticised the move as an assault on freedom of expression.
The BBC also expressed concern after a reporter for BBC Turkish was attacked on social media by the mayor of Ankara.

BBC reporters 'intimidated' by Turkey
The recorded phone call posted on Twitter appears to show Mr Erdogan asking his son Bilal to dispose of millions of euros in cash from a house.
Mr Erdogan says the allegations are a plot by his enemies to oust him.
In December, three Turkish government ministers resigned after their sons were taken into custody by police investigating allegations of bribery for construction projects.
All three sons were later released.
One of the ministers later said a great number of the construction projects had been approved by Mr Erdogan himself and he called on the prime minister to resign.

Once an ally of Mr Erdogan, Fethullah Gulen is an Islamic scholar who founded an influential social and cultural network which now includes more than 900 schools in Turkey.
Mr Gulen himself has lived in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999.
Followers of his Hizmet movement - whose name means ""service"" - are said to hold senior positions in the Turkish police, the judiciary and Mr Erdogan's AK Party itself.
However, Mr Gulen's critics believe Hizmet's aim is to gain power, to spread socially conservative Islamic attitudes on issues like marriage and alcohol around the globe, and to suppress any opposition.
Mr Erdogan has accused him of running a ""state within a state"" - an accusation he denies.
In December, Turkish pro-government media claimed prosecutors with ties to Mr Gulen had illegally wiretapped thousands of prominent figures.
Targets reportedly included government ministers and business leaders.
The claims were published a few hours ahead of the leaked recording said to be of Mr Erdogan.

Turkey prosecutors 'tapped phones'
The anger which led to last year's protests flared up again recently, with the news of the death of a 15-year-old boy who had been in a coma since last June.
Berkin Elvan was on his way to buy bread when he was hit on the head by a tear gas canister fired by police.
Mr Erdogan said the boy had links to ""terrorist organisations"".
His death brought the toll from last year's unrest to at least eight, including one policeman.
The protests began over plans to develop Istanbul's Gezi Park into a new mosque and shopping centre, but escalated into national demonstrations against what opponents see as Mr Erdogan's growing authoritarianism.

For many years, Mr Erdogan was held up as the role model for the leaders of Muslim countries, at ease with democracy and a pluralistic society. He has now been in power for 11 years. His critics say he is becoming increasingly autocratic.
Turkey is a member of Nato and is formally a candidate to join the European Union. European Commission Vice-President Neelie Kroes took to Twitter to voice her disappointment at the Twitter ban: ""The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.""
The German government also criticised the ban, as did the US-based research and pressure group Human Rights Watch, which called it a ""fundamental blow to freedom of expression"".
Mr Erdogan is likely to shrug off criticism from his foreign critics. But local elections are due to take place on 30 March, and the Turkish prime minister will have no choice but to listen to the voters' verdict.","Turkey has blocked the social networking site Twitter following Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vow to ""wipe out"" the service.",26680033,"Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing widespread criticism and opposition due to his government's recent bans on Twitter and other social media sites, as well as allegations of corruption and authoritarianism, which have led to protests and calls for his resignation.",0,"Article: {}

553,"The company is working on technology that combines disease-detecting nanoparticles, which would enter a patient's bloodstream via a swallowed pill, with a wrist-worn sensor.
The idea is to identify slight changes in the person's biochemistry that could act as an early warning system.
The work is still at an early stage.
Early diagnosis is the key to treating disease. Many cancers, such as pancreatic, are detected only after they have become untreatable and fatal.
There are marked differences between cancerous and healthy tissues.
Google's ambition is to constantly monitor the blood for the unique traces of cancer, allowing diagnosis long before any physical symptoms appear.
The project is being conducted by the search company's research unit, Google X, which is dedicated to investigating potentially revolutionary innovations.
It marks the firm's latest shift into the medical sector following its work on glucose-measuring contact lenses for patients with diabetes and the acquisition of a start-up that developed a spoon to counteract the tremors caused by Parkinson's disease.
Google has also bought stakes in Calico, an anti-ageing research company, and 23andMe, which offers personal genetic-testing kits.
The diagnostic project is being led by Dr Andrew Conrad, a molecular biologist who previously developed a cheap HIV test that has become widely used.
""What we are trying to do is change medicine from reactive and transactional to proactive and preventative,"" he told the BBC.
""Nanoparticles... give you the ability to explore the body at a molecular and cellular level.""
Google is designing a suite of nanoparticles which are intended to match markers for different conditions.
They could be tailored to stick to a cancerous cell or a fragment of cancerous DNA.
Or they could find evidence of fatty plaques about to break free from the lining of blood vessels. These can cause a heart attack or stroke if they stop the flow of blood.
Another set would constantly monitor chemicals in the blood.
High levels of potassium are linked to kidney disease. Google believes it will be possible to construct porous nanoparticles that alter colour as potassium passes through.
""Then [you can] recall those nanoparticles to a single location - because they are magnetic - and that location is the superficial vasculature of the wrist, [where] you can ask them what they saw,"" said Dr Conrad.
Unattached nanoparticles would move differently in a magnetic field from those clumped around a cancer cell.
In theory, software could then provide a diagnosis by studying their movements.
As part of the project, the researchers have also explored ways of using magnetism to concentrate the nanoparticles temporarily in a single area.
The tech company's ambition is ultimately to create a wristband that would take readings of the nanoparticles via light and radio waves one or more times a day.
Prof Paul Workman, chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, told the BBC News website: ""In principle this is great. Any newcomers with new ideas are welcome in the field.
""There is an urgent need for this. If we can detect cancer or other diseases earlier, then we can intervene with either lifestyle changes or treatment.
""How much of this proposal is dream versus reality is impossible to tell because it is a fascinating concept that now needs to be converted to practice.""
His team at the institute is investigating cancer cells and cancer DNA in the blood as new methods of diagnosis and planning treatment.
He did warn Google that a diagnosis could increase anxiety and lead to unnecessary treatment, so there needed to be ""very careful and rigorous analysis"" before this type of blood monitoring could be used widely.
The scheme is being made public because Google is now seeking to  establish partnerships.
But Dr Conrad sought to play down the idea that his firm wanted to run a search tool for the human body, alongside the one it already offers for the internet.
""We are the inventors of the technology but we have no intentions of commercialising it or monetising it in that way,"" he said.
""We will license it out and the partners will take it forward to doctors and patients.
""These are not consumer devices. They are prescriptive medical devices, and you know that doctor-patient relationships are pretty privileged and would not involve Google in any way.""
Analysis: James Gallagher, health editor
From searching the internet to searching your blood, Google certainly has high ambitions. But is it feasible?
The basic principles are sound and mirror the work already taking place around the world.
Many research groups are looking at bits of cancer floating in the blood as a better way of diagnosing the disease and also to assess which tumours are more aggressive.
But Google will have to address concerns around ""false positives"", when healthy people are told they are ill.
These have plagued the PSA test for prostate cancer, as PSA levels can soar even when cancer is absent.
There is also the issue of ""over-diagnosis"". Who needs treating even if a condition is discovered?
There is continuing controversy around breast cancer screening: for every life saved, three women have invasive treatment for a cancer that would never have proved fatal.
Screening the body for disease is littered with dangers, and if it is not done carefully, it could make hypochondriacs out of all of us.
The nanoparticle project is the latest so-called ""moonshot"" to originate from Google X.
Other schemes include the firm's driverless car effort and Project Loon, an attempt to provide internet access to remote areas via a network of high-altitude weather balloons.
While such ideas have the potential to make money, there is also a high risk of failure, and Google X acknowledges that several of its ideas have been ditched before being made public.
One analyst commented that its parent was in a rare position to make such investments.
""Under normal circumstances this is the kind of thing that would worry investors because such projects are too long-term and the miss rate is too high,"" said Cyrus Mewawalla, from CM Research.
""But because Google's core search business is currently so strong, shareholders are not worried at the moment and are allowing the firm to take a gamble.""
Analysis: Leo Kelion, technology desk editor
Google's diagnostic project may never come to fruition, but its significance lies in the fact it represents part of a wider push by the firm into health tech.
Bearing in mind this is already a crowded sector, it begs the question: why?
The search firm denies that it wants to run its own diagnosis service, with all the privacy headaches that would entail, but the patents it creates along the way could prove lucrative.
No doubt the fact that co-founder and Google X chief Sergey Brin has been told that a gene mutation has increased his likelihood of contracting Parkinson's has also focused efforts.
And the company clearly believes its expertise in ""big data"" analysis and its freedom to focus on giant leaps forward, rather than incremental steps, plays to its advantages.
It's worth remembering that another much hyped health idea, Google Flu Trends - which aimed to predict the spread of the virus based on internet searches - has been dubbed a failure by some after researchers said it had overestimated the number of cases in 100 out of 108 weeks.
And US health watchdogs banned Google-backed 23andme from selling the the heath data part of its genetic screening kits last year.
On the other hand, Google's ""smart lens"" for diabetics shows promise, with Swiss firm Novartis stepping up to license the technology in July.
And the forthcoming Android Fit platform, designed to harness data from other apps and wearables, has a good chance of success given the huge number of people using the operating system.","Google is aiming to diagnose cancers, impending heart attacks or strokes and other diseases, at a much earlier stage than is currently possible.",29802581,"Google is working on a project that involves developing nanoparticles that can detect diseases like cancer and other conditions by changing color when they come into contact with specific molecules, and the company is seeking partnerships to license the technology for use in medical diagnosis.",0,"Article: {}

He added Airbus had no plans to relocate its British factories.
Airbus has said in the past that a ""Brexit"" might change its plans.
Last month, Airbus UK's chief executive, Paul Kahn, said that if the UK voted to leave the EU in the planned in-out referendum, Airbus would reconsider future investment in the UK.
On Tuesday, Mr Bregier admitted he would have to make a judgement about what the consequences would be for the competitiveness of his business following the referendum.
His comments come as ministers tabled an amendment to the EU referendum bill on Monday evening, ruling out holding the plebiscite on 5 May 2016, the same day as Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish assembly elections and local elections.
It means the referendum is unlikely to take place before the autumn of 2016, depending on the prime minister's ability to negotiate concessions from his European counterparts and despite calls for the UK to get the vote over with.
Businesses have repeated raised concerns about the level of uncertainty caused by the timing of the referendum and the potential economic harm caused as investment decisions are delayed as a result.
Last month, Mr Kahn said the UK must compete for international investment.
""The best way to guarantee this is by remaining part of the EU,"" he said.
""I believe that it is vital for a company such as Airbus to come out and make a stand in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union.""
Airbus, the world's second-largest aircraft manufacturer after Boeing, employs 6,000 people at its site at Broughton, north Wales, where it assembles the wings for all Airbus aircraft.
Several thousand more people are employed at Filton, near Bristol, designing wings and testing landing gear.
Mr Kahn stressed that if the UK were to leave the EU, the company would not suddenly close.
But he added: ""If after an exit from the European Union, economic conditions in Britain were less favourable for business than in other parts of Europe, or beyond, would Airbus reconsider future investment in the United Kingdom? Yes, absolutely.""
Airbus is one of Europe's biggest industrial enterprises spanning civil aviation, defence and space, with operations in Germany, France and Spain.
In the event of a British exit from the EU, Mr Kahn suggested the company could face more red tape in areas such as work visas and trade barriers.
He said he was not ""blindly supporting Britain's membership of the EU"", adding: ""I welcome the UK government's intentions to deliver positive and hoped-for reforms - which would create a leaner and more efficient EU.""","Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier has said he has ""no intention"" of pulling manufacturing out of the UK if the country votes to leave the European Union (EU).",33146011,"Airbus, the world's second-largest aircraft manufacturer, has stated that it has no plans to relocate its British factories due to Brexit, but its CEO has admitted that the company will have to make a judgment about the consequences of the referendum on the competitiveness of its business.",0,"Article: {}

Bauke Mollema finished sixth to go second in the overall standings.
There were doubts the stage would go ahead after Thursday's attack in Nice.
Tour officials decided to continue with the race, with a heightened security presence, after at least 84 people were killed when a lorry drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern French city.
There was a sombre atmosphere at both the start and finish lines on stage 13, with most riders not learning of the news from Nice until they woke up on Friday morning.
""We want this day to be a day of dignity as a tribute to the victims,"" said race director Christian Prudhomme. ""The race must continue.""
There was a minute's silence held before the first rider set off on the course, and another minute's silence was observed as the jersey holders stood on stage after the day's racing had finished.
The riders, including Froome, placed their bouquets of flowers on an empty podium in a symbolic tribute for the victims in Nice.
Froome, who lives in Monaco, just 12 miles (20km) from Nice, said: ""This is definitely a time for people to stand together. It definitely puts things into perspective for us.
""I'm happy with how the stage went but everyone's thoughts are with the people in Nice. It's a special place for me, close to where I'm based, and I can't imagine what everyone is going through.""
Stage winner Dumoulin added: ""On one side I'm a very happy man but on the other side it's a very sad day.
""I woke up to the terrible news from Nice and there was a question whether we should race. It was a just decision in the end to race. It's terrible what happened and it shadows the day a lot.""
On the road, it proved to be a crucial day for 2013 and 2015 champion Froome, as he increased his lead on all of his yellow jersey rivals.
Last year the 31-year-old collected the yellow jersey on stage seven and never relinquished it.
""There will be a strong breakaway group but it will probably come back together and end in a bunch sprint finish""

And since wearing the maillot jaune on stage eight this year, the Team Sky rider has continued to put more time between himself and the other contenders.
His time trial may have been one minute three seconds slower than Dumoulin's superb stage-winning pace, but he was almost two minutes quicker than Mollema, who is now his closest threat for the overall lead.
Fellow Briton Adam Yates, 23, dropped from second to third, but continues to have a remarkable Tour, finishing seven seconds quicker than the highly regarded Nairo Quintana.
Colombian Quintana looks devoid of form, having been unable to chase Froome, Mollema and Richie Porte up Mont Ventoux on Thursday, and now falling to fourth and two minutes 59 seconds off the lead.
The comprehensive stage victory for Dumoulin strengthens the widely held belief that the 25-year-old has the potential to win a future Grand Tour - which includes the Giro d'Italia and La Vuelta.

Mr Bray said although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact on use of the drugs, ""intuitively I think it must have had an effect"".
""It will certainly make it less easy for the casual first-time user to get involved in this sort of stuff,"" he said adding that he believed many people were ""lulled into buying these things"" thinking they were legal and therefore safe.
The Angelus Foundation, which educates people on the risks of legal highs, said it believed many online traders had also shut down.
Jeremy Sare, director of communications at the charity, told the BBC: ""I think the ban has made a big difference and we are supportive of the legislation.
""What we are surprised about is the online supply hasn't surged. Traders seem to have stopped selling. It is still early days and we may look back in 12 months and see more online trading but many look to have closed.
""Many were operating within the law but now the law has gone against them so they haven't continued.""
He said the two biggest groups still using the drugs were homeless people and prisoners.
Greg, originally from Essex and now living in west Wales, told BBC Radio 5 live about his experience of a legal high known as Holy Smoke.
""I had just a little bit... My head just started spinning and I had this paranoid feeling. I just wanted to go home and hide but I couldn't walk properly. I honestly thought that I was going to die.
""From what I've heard it is still pretty regularly available. I think most people still think it's legal.""
""Alison"" a recovering drug user, has also used legal highs. ""They've got names like Train Wreck, Black Cobra and Pandora's Box,"" she said. ""It's still really easy to get. You can get three packets for about Â£25.
""No prices have changed. Nothing has changed at all. People are still walking around with it and selling it from home. I don't think it [the ban] has made one bit of difference.""
However, Harry Shapiro, director of DrugWise, said although the ban may have put off ""casual and curious"" drug users, it had not deterred those with a serious drug problem and had driven the market underground.
""It's moved from the shops to the street,"" he said.
The drugs have been linked to 444 deaths since 2010, including two brothers from Scotland.
William McGough, 30, was in the grip of an addiction to the drugs when he drowned in a river in Wick, Scotland, in 2013.
Then, in May, the body of his brother Simon, 37, was found next to a packet of the psychoactive substances.
Their sister, Melanie Downie, 40, spoke publicly about their deaths to highlight the ""addictive and destructive"" nature of the drugs.
Sarah Newton the government's safeguarding minister, said the drugs ""have already cost far too many lives"".
""I'm encouraged to see that - three months in - police are using their new powers to take dealers off our streets and that so many retailers have been denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade.""
""These drugs are not legal, they are not safe and we will not allow them to be sold in this country,"" she added.","More than 300 UK retailers are no longer selling so-called legal highs, three months after a ban was introduced, the Home Office has said.",37185996,"The UK government has banned legal highs, also known as psychoactive substances, and has seen 24 shops closed and 186 alleged offenders arrested, but some argue that the ban has only driven the market underground and has not deterred serious drug users.",0,"Article: {}

561,"Mylan said it expected to start selling a cheaper generic product ""in several weeks"" at a list price of $300 (Â£230).
That is about half the list price of the existing product, which is used in emergencies for severe food and insect allergies.
The cost of EpiPens in the US has risen by 500% in less than a decade.
Mylan said the generic version would be identical to the branded EpiPen, which costs $600 for two doses.
Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. They also expire after 12 months.
Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007.
""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,"" she said. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.""
The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan.
Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: ""We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market.""
Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest.
How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage.
Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them ""outrageous"" and unjustified.
The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York.
Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy.

The planned system would see passengers transported in gondolas along a route from Cardiff central train station.
CBC chairman Nigel Roberts said it would carry 2,500 tourists and commuters every hour.
He said: ""The great thing about Cardiff Bay is that when you get up into the air you can get a phenomenal view.""
If plans get off the ground, the gondolas would pass through the city's Central Square and Cardiff Bay before terminating in Penarth.
The scheme, which would cost about £20m per mile, could be funded from the Welsh transport budget, the private sector and sponsorship, Mr Roberts suggested.

566,"British police accuse him of stealing $250m (£160m) over eight years.
The prosecutor called him a ""thief in government house"".
Ibori, once seen as one of Nigeria's wealthiest and most influential politicians, was arrested in 2010 in Dubai and then extradited to London.
Some $35m of his alleged UK assets were frozen in 2007.
As his trial at London's Southwark Crown Court was about to begin, Mr Ibori changed his plea to guilty and admitted stealing money from Delta state and laundering it in London through a number of offshore companies.
The BBC's Chris Summers says between 20 and 30 of Mr Ibori's supporters turned up to court - some wearing T-shirts with the slogan ""Free Ibori"". There was not enough room for them all in the public gallery.
Prosecuting QC Sasha Wass said Mr Ibori, 53, had ""tricked"" his way into becoming Delta state governor, by giving a false date of birth and claiming he had no criminal record.
""He was never the legitimate governor and there was effectively a thief in government house. As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta state's wealth and hand out patronage.""
He is due to be sentenced on 16 April.
Ibori's wife, Theresa, his sister, Christine, his mistress, Udoamaaka Okoronkwo, and his London solicitor, Bhadresh Gohil, have all been convicted of money-laundering.
Their convictions could only be reported on Monday after reporting restrictions were lifted.
Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had asked the UK's Metropolitan Police to look into the ex-governor's financial affairs.
""The vast sums of money involved were used to fund Mr Ibori's lavish lifestyle,"" Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, the officer in charge of the investigation, said.
""We will now be actively seeking the confiscation of all of his stolen assets so they can be repatriated for the benefit of the people of Delta State.""
He said that the money Ibori stole should have been used to pay for sanitation, power supplies and healthcare for some of the poorest people in the world.
Ibori spent some of the stolen money buying six houses in London - he paid £2.2m in cash for one Hampstead mansion - and put his children in expensive British private schools, police say.
Three of the money-laundering charges relate to the sale of Delta state's share in mobile phone company V-Mobile to neighbouring Akwa Ibom state.
This raised $37m which Ibori stole and laundered through his solicitor Gohil, who has been jailed for 10 years.
In 2007, a UK court froze assets allegedly belonging to him worth $35m.
His annual salary as Delta state governor was less than $25,000.
He had already left the UK when his assets were seized but he was arrested in Nigeria later that year.
The charges were dismissed but he was then re-arrested in Dubai on a British warrant.
Ibori has been convicted in the UK before - in 1991 for stealing, in cahoots with his wife who worked as a cashier, from the Neasden, London, branch of the DIY shop Wickes.
He was also found guilty in 1992 for being in possession of a stolen credit card and having used it to fraudulently withdraw $1,590.
Nigeria is one of the world's biggest oil producers. Under its federal system, state governors enjoy huge powers and control budgets larger than those of many West African countries.
They have immunity from prosecution while in office.

567,"""You,"" he said to Foster, ""are the worst Rangers player ever.""
Foster was momentarily taken aback, but then old instincts asserted themselves. Foster answered back.
""Why do you feel it's necessary to say that or that it's ok to say that?"" Foster asked.
The response was that he was a fan, he paid his money at games, so he was entitled to his opinion.
""It got to the point that because I kept challenging him, somebody noticed and said that we need to get security because I was harassing him,"" Foster says with a look of incredulity.
""I got fixated on it and should have let it go, but I was just minding my own business, not walking about with a big sign saying, 'I'm the greatest'. Now, an hour later, I'm laughing at it and thinking it's ridiculous, but at the time it did annoy me.
""He'll maybe feel great when he tells his pals that he abused me. It's not nice. I love Glasgow, I love the people and I love living here, but I don't want to always be on my guard.""
Moments of criticism have pockmarked Foster's career, and he admits that he finds it difficult to just brush them aside. He is not capable of the flippancy of some footballers, but his response is not born out of defensiveness either. When he feels that criticism is valid, Foster uses it for motivation.
There have been moments in his life when he feels that family time has been impinged upon. Last season, Foster took his son to the New Year carnival in Glasgow 24 hours after Rangers lost to Hibernian.
He returned home to find that he had been criticised by a Rangers fan on Twitter, but felt that was unfair since this was his Christmas time with his son, who lives with his mother.
""What do you want me to become, a hermit, and hand back the money I've earned because we got beaten?"" Foster says. ""You're going to lose games, but that doesn't mean I'm not trying or working hard; it's sometimes you play badly or have bad luck.
""There were a few occasions [as an Aberdeen player], one time when I was sitting with my parents and a couple of guys walked past and made a comment, but luckily I was the only one who heard it.
""I'm a great believer that that's my time with my family and if you want to make a comment at 3 o'clock on a Saturday, when you've paid your money to come to the game, then vent and tell me whatever it is you want to tell me.
""It's not just negative, people come up and ask for signatures and photographs and they're very complimentary. But the ones who are not are the ones that stick with you. It's not nice being told how rubbish you are.
""I'm pretty bad about going home and beating myself up about it, so the last thing I need is somebody else telling me how bad I was. But that's part of playing football.""
Foster is a quick, industrious and earnest player, a winger in his youth who was converted into a full-back in his early days at Aberdeen out of necessity.  He was a boyhood Rangers fan who broke through at Pittodrie and contributed to the resurgence of the team under Jimmy Calderwood, but a clash of personalities with Mark McGhee led to Foster being loaned out to Rangers in the deal that took Andrius Velicka to Aberdeen.
Foster returned as a title winner, but the extent of the rivalry between the two sets of fans meant that his second spell at Aberdeen turned fraught, even when he was made captain by Craig Brown and Archie Knox.
""It was difficult, going back and then being made captain in the first pre-season game, a couple of the Aberdeen fans were singing songs and making comments about me and they were obviously not very happy that I'd played [for Rangers],"" Foster said.
""I made a comment as I went off the pitch, and of course the fans are 100 yards away, the press are two feet away. It's mumbled almost to myself but they hear it and then it's a story.""
There is an honest, engaging quality to Foster. He has played in major Champions League matches, captained Aberdeen and enjoyed a solid professional career, yet encountered plenty of jarring moments, too.
After a spell at Bristol City, he returned to Rangers and soon after signed up for Twitter, where he was immediately abused by the first person who responded to him.
""The guy said he would take great delight in watching me get hit by a bus, die in the street and he would revel in a party afterwards to celebrate,"" Foster says. ""It was that absurd that I laughed to myself, I couldn't believe I was reading this.
""I don't understand the mentality of a person who would think, 'I've got five spare minutes, I'm going to go on Twitter and send this abuse to someone I've never met'. You look at his profile and he was relatively young, so the time I was at Aberdeen he was maybe 13, 14, so has he really seen me play and what's his motivation? Purely that I've signed for Rangers?
""I wouldn't say it to my worst enemy in the world. When it's criticism of how I've played, I can get over it and take it on board, but when it's abuse - you're rubbish, the worst player ever - it's a nothing comment, I can't do anything with that. It doesn't mean anything, but you can't get it out your head as quick.""
Foster now spends his life between Elgin and Glasgow, where his girlfriend, the singer Amy Macdonald, lives. He is comfortable with the different pace of life as a Ross County player, and recalls fondly the memory of the couple going out for dinner in Inverness while he was still wearing his club tracksuit and not being stopped or approached by anybody.
At 30, he is young enough to hold at bay serious thoughts about life after retirement, although he is doing a psychology degree on the Open University - ""to try to understand people"". He is content with his life, having made much of his career, and the spikiness, the unwillingness to stand down, are simply aspects of his character.
They are shared in some senses with Macdonald, who has also had to develop coping mechanisms for living in the public eye. They react with anger at times, but are also able to see the black humour of the attention, like when Foster was booed by the Motherwell fans earlier this season.
""My girlfriend said to me, 'it's quite funny that you've managed to unite the whole of Scotland, everyone's going to boo you',"" Foster said. ""It does help [that] we're both used to that. I spoke to her after [the shopping incident] and she said the guy's lucky she wasn't there.
""She would laugh it off if it was against her but she's more protective with me. She can be very cutting and she's quick, so that guy today before he'd finished his sentence he would have felt pretty bad about himself.""
Foster has earned the right to feel good about himself and his career.","During a recent shopping trip in Glasgow, Ricky Foster noticed a young man walk by with his friends and then turn back to approach him.",34461189,"Former Aberdeen and Rangers player Marcus Foster discusses the criticism he has faced throughout his career, including abuse and negative comments from fans, and how he has learned to deal with it by not taking it personally and using it as motivation to improve his game.",1,"Article: {}

570,"Hirst rose from humble beginnings in Leeds to become the UK's richest living artist, worth Â£215m according to the Sunday Times' Rich List.
Penguin Books has promised to push the book in the same ""radical"" manner as Morrissey's autobiography, which was published under its classic imprint.
The artist has selected journalist James Fox as his ghostwriter.
Fox was the writer behind Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards' autobiography, as well as the book White Mischief, which recounted the Happy Valley murder case in Kenya in 1941.
Hirst was one of the founding members of the Young British Artists (YBA) movement, which also counted Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas and Mark Wallinger amongst its numbers.
Many of them were students at Goldsmiths College in London in the late 1980s. Their first major exhibition, in a warehouse, attracted a number of influential art collectors, including Charles Saatchi - who would later become one of his Hirst's greatest supporters.
Hirst's work - which includes spot paintings and a sheep and shark preserved in formaldehyde - has frequently had the ability to shock.
A two-day auction of his work in 2008 raised a record-breaking Â£111m.
Speaking on the Today programme, Fox said: ""He (Hirst) grew up in a pretty bad situation, with his mother, and he and his gang - many of whom became YBA artists, spent half their time housebreaking, stealing, [indulging in] criminality, and the rest of their time indulging their passion for art, which started very early on in their years.
""I found that completely fascinating, moving, the idea of a saving connection to art. The fearlessness of Damien, his ability to take on authority, to never say anything can't be done, to break all the rules. That very much comes from that background.""","Damien Hirst is to publish his autobiography, promising to lay bare the British modern art world.",26915100,"Damien Hirst, the UK's richest living artist, has selected journalist James Fox as his ghostwriter for his upcoming autobiography, which will detail his rise from humble beginnings in Leeds to his status as a world-renowned artist, including his experiences as a founding member of the Young British Artists movement and his unconventional upbringing.",0,"Article: {}

He is the most prominent footballer to publicly reveal his homosexuality and his former team-mates were quick to praise his announcement.
Arsenal and Germany forward Lukas Podolski wrote on Twitter: ""Respect to Thomas Hitzlsperger! That was a courageous and correct decision and an important step.""
And retired defender Arne Friedrich, who played with Hitzlsperger at Euro 2008, wrote: ""Proud of you Thomas. A good decision and in my opinion the right time.""
There was also support for Hitzlsperger from leading figures in German football administration.
""Finally, a footballer has the courage to make his sexuality public,"" said Theo Zwanziger, the former president of the German Football Association.
Bundesliga president Reinhard Rauball said in a statement: ""The decision of Thomas Hitzlsperger to be the first prominent footballer to make public his homosexuality is - even after his active career - a huge and courageous step, and surely leads the way in the fight against homophobia.""

Thomas Hitzlsperger has shown a lot of courage today. Sad times when people have to wait till they retire from their chosen profession...

Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger - welcome to the club!
Bayern Munich, the club where Hitzlsperger began his career as a junior, also tweeted their support for the midfielder's ""brave step"".
Hitzlsperger's announcement is seen as a watershed moment in Germany, which like England has struggled with the problem of homophobia in football.
Zwanziger admitted that football was ""now as ever a hard business, where unfortunately an open discourse about homosexuality is still not taken for granted"".
Current Germany captain Philipp Lahm created controversy in 2011 when he wrote in his autobiography that he would encourage gay footballers to keep quiet about their sexuality.
""I would not encourage any gay professional footballer to come out,"" he wrote at the time. ""I would fear that he would end up like Justin Fashanu [the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay].""
The last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban, who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert praised Hitzlsperger for going public.
""It's good that he's spoken about something which is important to him,"" Seibert told a media briefing.
""We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance.
""We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worthily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr Hitzlsperger.""
Openly Gay German politician Volker Beck said he hoped Hitzlsperger's announcement would encourage others to do the same.
""I hope that Hitzlsperger's courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo,"" he said. ""It's now the job of the German FA to embolden active players [to do the same].""
And Zwanziger said he was optimistic that Hitzlsperger's announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football.
He said: ""I'm confident that sexual orientations will soon not be an issue in football at all.""",German football has rallied around Thomas Hitzlsperger after the former international midfielder revealed he was gay.,25654437,"Former German footballer Thomas Hitzlsperger made history by publicly revealing his homosexuality, sparking widespread support and admiration from fellow professionals, football administrators, and political leaders in Germany and beyond, with many hailing his courageous step as a watershed moment in the fight against homophobia in the country's football culture.",0,"Article: {}

573,"Gen Sir Nicholas Houghton told the BBC's Andrew Marr that refusing to launch nuclear weapons would ""seriously undermine"" Britain's ""deterrent"".
And he said he would be worried if such a view ""translated into power"".
Mr Corbyn called on the defence secretary to ""take action"" against Sir Nicholas over his comments.
In a statement, the Labour leader said: ""It is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has today intervened directly in issues of political dispute.
""It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times.
""By publicly taking sides in current political arguments, Sir Nicholas Houghton has clearly breached that constitutional principle. Accordingly, I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld.""
Mr Corbyn, a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party's annual conference when he revealed that would never press the ""nuclear button"" - and he has since praised Scottish Labour's rejection of Trident.
Mr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to ""promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear-free world"".
Asked about Mr Corbyn's refusal to use nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas said: ""It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were.""
He added: ""The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use.
""When people say you're never going to use the deterrent, what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don't have to use it because you successfully deter.
""If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button, ""the deterrent is then completely undermined,"" he added.
""Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that, dare I say, the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation, 'I understand how this thing works'.""
Attending a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas's comments had been ""unhelpful"".
""I would gently say to him, with the greatest of respect, we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions,"" he told Channel 4 News.
""If he's worried, I think he should talk to me about it. I don't think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate.""
Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an ""open-minded"" review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn's views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident.
She said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary.
But she appeared to back Sir Nicholas, telling Andrew Marr: ""I understand the point that he is making. It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said.""
She defended the right of Britain's most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue.
""I don't think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms,"" she said.
She indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party's current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet.
""I am not a unilateral nuclear disarmer. I don't believe that that works.
""I think I would find it difficult [to continue in the shadow cabinet] but we are not there yet.

With Caolan Mooney starring, the Mournemen extended their advantage to six midway through the second half.
Meath reduced Down's lead but they home side held on after a nervous finish.
Down went into the game propping up Division Two after disappointing opening defeats by Fermanagh and Clare.
County secretary Sean Og McAteer felt compelled to release a length statement on Thursday night denying reports of unrest within Eamonn Burns' squad and Saturday's win will be a huge boost for the management.
After hammering Derry at Navan two weeks ago, Meath were favourites heading into the Pairc Esler contest but the Mournemen produced a performance of grit and determination to chisel out the vital Division Two victory.
Murphy's goal, as he flicked a mishit Darragh O'Hanlon free past Paddy O'Rourke, was the perfect start for the home side as they were never headed in the contest.
With midfielder Peter Turley putting himself about and former under-age star Mooney producing his best game in the Down senior jersey, the home side pushed on from leading only 1-1 to 0-3 to move five ahead by the interval.
O'Hanlon slotted three first-half frees while the impressive Conor Maginn, Barry O'Hagan (two), Ryan Johnston and Aidan Carr also got on the scoresheet for Down in the opening period.
Fresh from his Sigerson Cup heroics with St Mary's, Kevin McKernan also excelled in the opening period for the Mournement as Meath laboured, with free-taker Donal Lenihan hitting three of their points.
A McKernan point extended Down's lead to 1-11 to 0-8 by the 52nd minute after a great block at the other end by Carr had prevented Brian Menton for netting a Meath goal.
After their struggles in recent times, it was not a surprise to see Down attempting to hold on to their lead in the closing stages and Meath, helped by the introduction of the speedy Eamonn Wallace, reduced the margin to three by the time the game entered injury time.
Inevitably, there was a late scare for Down as Lenihan aimed for goal from his last-gasp 13-metre free and the ball skimmed off the crossbar over for a point before the final whistle was blown seconds later.

578,"Ch Insp David Pettigrew believes the cameras would act as a deterrent to disorder and vandalism.
Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made it difficult.
The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction.
The 37-acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3,500 monuments and sculptures.
Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC: ""At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way.
""That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury.
""Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.""
Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council.
The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further.
He added: ""CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also.
""The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, we cannot be here 24 hours a day.""
Police Scotland told the BBC they only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents.
The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis.
Ruth Johnston, the group's chairwoman, said: ""I don't think it (anti-social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here.
""People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn't be so many people coming if they didn't feel safe.
""The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here.""
Alexander ""Greek"" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there.
A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3,500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50,000 people buried at the site in total.
Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise Â£60,000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and they will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts.
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: ""Community Safety Glasgow currently deploy two daily security patrols, staggered day and night, to the Necropolis and random mobile CCTV patrols are also conducted in the area to deter and detect antisocial behaviour. Foot patrols are also carried out within the Necropolis to deter dog fouling.
""There are also quarterly meetings between Police Scotland, the council, Community Safety Glasgow and the Friends of the Necropolis group to discuss any issues.
""The possibility of using re-deployable CCTV in the Necropolis was also explored, but the topography of the site made it difficult in terms of radio signalling.""
A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland, which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis, added: ""We are aware that there has been an issue with vandalism and anti-social behaviour at Glasgow Necropolis.
""Whilst we are not aware of any recent requests to Glasgow City Council planning department regarding the potential installation of CCTV we would be happy to discuss this and other proposals for improving security within the grounds of the Necropolis with them.

580,"Four constituents raised the action under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister.
Judges have ruled that there will now be a ""By Order hearing"" to discuss the next part of the case.
Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions.
The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals.
The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was ""wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself"".
However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case.
These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said ""for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election"".
The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts.
Lady Paton said: ""Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context.
""The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement.""
Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was ""irrelevant"" and ""bound to fail"".
Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live.
The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years.
It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April.

582,"Navalny had denied the charges, saying the trial was politically motivated.
The 37-year-old had been a leading campaigner against President Putin's United Russia party, and regularly blogged about corruption allegations.
The EU said the verdict posed ""serious questions"" about the state of Russian law. The US said it was ""deeply disappointed"".
Before he was handcuffed and led away, Navalny urged his supporters to continue his anti-corruption struggle, tweeting: ""Don't sit around doing nothing.""
Navalny has previously said he would like to stand for president one day.
He had recently registered his candidacy for the next mayor of Moscow, but his campaign team said that after the verdict he was withdrawing from the race, and called on his supporters to boycott the vote.
By Oleg BoldyrevBBC News, Kirov
Minutes after Judge Blinov started reading from the substantial sheaf of papers, it became evident the two defendants, Alexei Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, were going to be found guilty.
Seasoned observers of this trial were just about able to pick up the judge's words. Others were bewildered by the hum-like reading.
Entering the courtroom just before the verdict reading started, both defendants were far from gloomy. ""Why sad faces?"" quipped Navalny, walking past dozens of journalists and a row of cameras.
Navalny has long acquired the skill of tweeting and blogging while interminable financial documents were read by prosecution, defence and, now, judge.
Publishing his fiery comments on politics, corruption and the need to unite in opposition to Vladimir Putin's regime - that's one of the many things he won't be able to do from behind bars, waiting for the sentence to be appealed against.
'Explosion of anger'
The BBC's Moscow correspondent Daniel Sandford says that when the sentence was handed down, there were tears from Navalny's supporters and an explosion of anger on the social networking sites that he has used so effectively.
Anti-Putin activist and former cabinet minister Boris Nemtsov told reporters the trial was ""completely fabricated from start to finish, and even the judge could not say what the reason for the crime was"".
Other countries have also voiced their concern at the verdict. The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, said: ""We are deeply disappointed in the conviction of Navalny and the apparent political motivations in this trial.""
A spokesperson for the EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, said the embezzlement charges were unsubstantiated, and that Navalny's jailing posed ""serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia"".
French foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot added his concern, but said: ""We note that not all judicial remedies have been exhausted and that the sentence could be reviewed on appeal.""
Navalny's supporters in Moscow have vowed to stage protests against the verdict later on Thursday.
'Almost inevitable'
Navalny arrived at the courtroom in Kirov to hear the verdict after a 12-hour overnight train journey from Moscow.
Our correspondent said Navalny smiled in a resigned manner when the almost inevitable guilty verdict came.
His wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said her husband knew he would get a non-suspended sentence and was mentally prepared to go to prison.
Navalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled timber worth 16m rubles ($500,000; Â£330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor Nikita Belykh.
The prosecution had asked for a six-year jail sentence, but judge Sergei Blinov decided on five years, and said there were no extenuating circumstances that would warrant keeping Navalny out of prison.
Navalny's co-accused, Pyotr Ofitserov, was also found guilty, and given a four-year jail sentence.
""Navalny... committed a grave crime,"" said Judge Blinov as he delivered the sentence.
State television has only shown limited interest in the process despite Navalny's prominence, but online the trial has been followed extensively.
Mr Navalny came to public attention when he inspired mass protests against the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin in December 2011.
Profile: Alexei Navalny
A thorn in Putin's side
Judge Blinov said he found the testimony of the main prosecution witness, Vyacheslav Opalev, to be ""trustworthy and consistent''.
Navalny insists that Mr Opalev spoke against him out of revenge, because Navalny had recommended he be fired and his company investigated for corruption.
After the verdict, Navalny tweeted: ""So that's it. Don't get bored without me. Most importantly, don't sit around doing nothing. The toad won't get off the oil pipe by itself.""
In his LiveJournal blog on Wednesday Navalny said: ""The current authorities are not a big, healthy fish, but rather a bloated fish or Latin American toad, which puffs itself up when it sees danger, with the help of television.""
In an unusual step, the court allowed the whole trial to be broadcast live online.
He is now one of the key figures of the opposition - a thorn in the side of the political establishment, campaigning against the endemic corruption, our correspondent says.

Prison Reform Trust director Juliet Lyon said: ""Providing people with the knowledge and skills to help them lead a law-abiding life on release should be a central aim of a modern and effective penal system.""
Mr Gove said: ""We have more than 80,000 adults in our custody.

But it is not clear who will attend the indirect talks in Geneva, with some opposition leaders yet to confirm.
On the ground in Syria, a partial truce that began 12 days ago has considerably reduced the intensity of the fighting.
Mr de Mistura said the cessation of hostilities was holding ""by and large"" and was open-ended as far as the UN was concerned.
The first round of talks on a political solution to the conflict in Syria was suspended last month while still in the ""preparatory"" phase, with both sides blaming each other.
It came as government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, launched a major offensive on opposition-controlled areas around the northern city of Aleppo.
The government succeeded in cutting a key rebel supply route from Turkey to Aleppo before the US and Russia brokered the cessation of hostilities agreement, which does not include the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.
At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr de Mistura welcomed what he described as ""a sustained reduction of violence"".
""Incidents are taking place, no question and they are. I'm expecting even worse incidents to take place, probably caused by spoilers,"" he added.
""The secret will be whether the sides are in a position, as so far touch wood has been the case, [to] contain them, make them not become an unravelling of what has been after five years quite a change... for the life of every Syrian.""
Mr de Mistura said he expected informal discussions to begin at hotels across Geneva immediately, but that formal talks would not resume until Monday.
He added that they would once again be indirect ""proximity"" talks, with representatives of the warring parties located in separate rooms, and would last only 10 days before pausing for a week.
""We believe that having a timetable and a time limit is healthy for everyone so that we don't think that we can go onâ€¦ for two weeks hoping to get into substance - we go seriously into substance as soon as we can.""
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the focus of the talks will be a transitional government, a new constitution, and elections. Humanitarian access and ceasefire violations will not be on the agenda.

But the South American side scarcely deserved to take the game into extra-time after a very patchy performance, particularly in defence.
Mano Menezes's team had scored three in each of their previous five games and were treating the tournament as an important staging post ahead of hosting the World Cup in 2014.
But if they are to succeed on home soil they will have to show a significant improvement from what they produced at Wembley, with star forward Neymar a largely peripheral figure.
Menezes went into Saturday's match under huge pressure to deliver gold and fill the one significant missing blank for the Brazilian team, but if the game was to be Brazil's coronation as Olympic champions then Mexico clearly had not read the script.

They defeated Brazil 2-0 in a friendly earlier in the summer and stunned Wembley when Peralta's low strike nestled in the bottom corner while many inside the stadium were still taking their seats.
Manchester United defender Rafael was partly at fault for the goal, his sloppy pass allowing Javier Aquino to nip in and dispossess Sandro, with the ball running invitingly into the path of Peralta.
Brazil could not find their stride - a situation not helped by a series of niggly fouls that broke up play and angered coach Menezes, who could be seen waving an imaginary card on the touchline.
And their disappointing start was put into stark perspective when Menezes made a change just after the half-hour mark, bringing on Hulk for Alex Sandro.
""Mexico deserve it, Brazil were arrogant and sloppy. They just thought they could turn up and win. It was a shocking performance from Brazil. They started poorly and continued in that vein.""
The substitution made a difference and Jose Corona managed to palm clear a swerving strike from Hulk while Marcelo shot wastefully wide after he had linked with Oscar and Leandro Damiao to carve open the left side of the Mexican defence.
By the early stages of the second half it was obvious that Mexico had opted to try to defend their lead.
This seemed to play into the hands of their opponents, particularly Neymar, who had disappointed in the opening half but briefly relished the chance to repeatedly run at the Mexico defence.
He twice shot wide and saw another effort blocked, but his influence soon faded and Mexico almost struck with a swift break.
There was more shoddy Brazilian defending involved too, as Fabian dispossessed an opponent far too easily and eventually saw his overhead effort rebound off the crossbar.
An unmarked Peralta later slotted home from six yards but Brazil were saved by the offside flag. There was to be no reprieve with 15 minutes remaining.
A free-kick was delivered from the right and the Mexico striker was left completely alone to head home from eight yards.

He was declared a 'Servant of God' in 1960 and in 2014 he was made a 'Venerable' by Pope Francis.
In certain circumstances beatification can later lead to sainthood.
Fr Sullivan was brought up by a wealthy protestant family and was a later teacher at Clongowes Wood College in County Kildare.
Since the 1940s Fr Sullivan's supporters have been campaigning for him to be made a saint.
The attribution of a miracle is given to those who have died for the faith, while receiving a sainthood requires a miracle.
Those named on the decree include Albanian Bishop, Vincens Prenushi, who died in prison in 1949 after being tortured for demanding the formation of a breakaway Albanian church under the country's former communist regime.

595,"Rafa Benitez's ill-fated reign had left Los Blancos trailing both Atletico Madrid and Barcelona in La Liga, with points dropped in four of their previous eight games and memories still fresh of a humiliating 4-0 home thrashing by Barca.
Now, less than nine months later, not only are Zidane's Real the European champions, they are also on the verge of breaking La Liga's all-time record for consecutive victories.
Sunday's 2-0 triumph at Espanyol was the 16th straight victory for Zidane's men, who ended last season just one point behind champions Barca after winning their final 12 games. This season they have established early control of top spot with maximum points from four games.
That winning streak is a Real record and also equals the best winning sequence in Spain's top flight, achieved by Pep Guardiola's all-conquering Barca in 2010-11.
And they have the chance to beat that on Wednesday with victory over Villarreal at the Bernabeu.
So, how has Zidane done it? Not in the way you might have expected.
Saturday, 27 February 2016 was a major turning point in 44-year-old Zidane's early managerial career.
Real lost their derby at home to Atletico 1-0, jeered off by dissatisfied fans who felt the team had failed to progress since Benitez's exit.
Until then, Zidane had shoe-horned as many attacking players into his line-ups as possible in an attempt to fulfil his pledge to deliver the kind of exciting, free-flowing football associated with his playing days.
It wasn't working. The forwards were getting in each other's way and the lack of defensive instincts in midfield was making the team vulnerable, brutally exposed by the way Atletico strolled unchallenged through the centre of the pitch for Antoine Griezmann's match-winner.
Zidane knew something had to change - and that something was the introduction of defensive midfielder Casemiro, the low-profile Brazilian who had previously only played 23 minutes under his management.
Casemiro, 24, moved to the Bernabeu from Sao Paulo in February 2013, making his debut under Jose Mourinho in a 3-1 home win over Real Betis two months later.
But Carlo Ancelotti sent him on loan to Porto for the season in the summer of 2014, then he was largely left on the bench by Benitez and initially by Zidane, with both managers compromised by the pressure to field more flamboyant, attacking talents.
However, derby defeat forced Zidane to rethink, and Casemiro rapidly became indispensable, with his powerful physique, tackling ability and positional discipline giving the team a previously lacking defensive presence in midfield.
Real began their winning streak with a 3-1 triumph at Levante, and were five victories into it when the game that would prove to be their turning point arrived: the Clasico at Barcelona on 2 April.
Barca were paying tribute to club legend Johan Cruyff, who had died a week earlier, and they had every intention of marking his memory with another crushing victory over their biggest rivals.
Instead, it proved to be a prototype performance from Zidane's new-look team, who were undeterred by falling behind to Gerard Pique's header and bounced back to win with goals from Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.
There was little flair in Real's victory, but the players obeyed Zidane's command - delivered in the wake of the defeat by Atletico - to ""run more"".
Notably, the French coach delivered the same message in the build-up to the Champions League final against their city rivals in May, urging: ""What we have to do is run, run, run and run.""
Forget spectacular, attacking football inspired by megastar Galacticos, Zidane was turning his team into a bunch of grafters committed to their defensive duties and increasingly confident in their ability to grind out wins even when not playing well.
Seven of Real's past 19 victories have been secured by goals in the last 10 minutes - most recently the Champions League triumph over Sporting Lisbon which prompted Marca to hail them as ""Comeback FC"" and state Zidane has ""recovered the virtue of never giving up"".
Although his strongest XI more or less picks itself, Zidane is committed to a policy of squad rotation, regularly emphasising the importance of a group mentality and insisting every player is important.
Every manager says similar things but Zidane's talk is not just empty rhetoric, with his commitment to rotation backed up by statistics.
He has fielded 21 players in Real's four league games this season - and only goalkeeper Kiko Casilla (deputising for Keylor Navas) and Sergio Ramos have started all four.
Furthermore, Zidane has selected five different forward lines in his team's six competitive games, and their 12 league goals have been scored by 11 different players. You can't get much more 'group mentality' than that.
Spain's most famously pro-Real journalist, Tomas Roncero from newspaper AS, this week saluted Zidane by writing: ""Zidane leads a squad of 24 players, not 11.
""This squad doesn't just have a plan B, but also a plan C and plan D. I've never seen a Madrid so complete, versatile, and reliable.""
That tribute is also, naturally, an unspoken dig at Barcelona, who are routinely accused of being too reliant upon their Messi-Suarez-Neymar forward line and, when the second-stringers started at home to Alaves 10 days ago, lost 2-1.
Not many managers could leave out a player for months, recall him to the starting line-up, see him score a record-breaking goal and then hear that player declare the manager ""will always be my idol"".
But Zidane was given that endorsement by James Rodriguez after the Colombia international, making his first start of the season, rifled home the opener in Real's hard-earned 2-0 victory at Espanyol on Sunday.
And it's clear that Zidane, a 1998 World Cup winner with France who became a Real legend with a brilliant volley in the 2002 Champions League final victory over Bayer Leverkusen, is benefitting from the credibility provided by his stellar playing career.
Zidane commands automatic respect - and his aura makes it easier for him to retain good relationships with players he leaves out of the team.
So, too, does his constant reassertion of the team ethic and his commitment to squad rotation - it's much easier for dropped players to stay motivated when they know they have a genuine chance of starting next week.
Considering his penchant for petulance during his playing days, it is perhaps surprising that another quality which has helped Zidane manage Real's egos is his calm and composed personality.
Whether on the sidelines, in front of the media or at the training ground, Zidane looks relaxed and always ready to smile, even maintaining his good-humoured patience when asked, as he has been countless times this summer, whether he was intending to sell James.
If you ask Barcelona fans whether Zidane is a great manager, they will scoff and say he is a lucky manager.
When asked on social media for his hopes from the Champions League, Barca star Pique ironically replied he would like the kind of campaign enjoyed by Real last season.
""Easy group. Third-placed team in Italy in the last 16 [Roma], eighth in Germany in the quarters [Wolfsburg], fourth in England in the semis [Man City]. Return leg always at home,"" Pique tweeted.
And it's true that Real - with all those late winners - have enjoyed some fortune during their record-breaking run, most recently when Sergio Ramos avoided a second yellow card for handball at Espanyol on Sunday by successfully pretending the ball hit his face.
Although the ""lucky"" argument only takes you so far, it's certainly too soon to proclaim Zidane as an unqualified coaching triumph. The season is young and it's never wise to bank on too much stability in the soap opera that is Real Madrid.
Nevertheless, a Champions League title and 16 straight league wins cannot be discounted lightly - and victory over Villarreal would be another step forward in Zidane's coaching career, which is so far threatening to be every bit as successful as his playing career.","When Zinedine Zidane was appointed Real Madrid manager in January, the Spanish giants were in disarray.",37420223,"Real Madrid's recent success under manager Zinedine Zidane, including 16 straight league wins and the European Champions League title, can be attributed to his focus on defensive stability and squad rotation, as well as his ability to manage the team's egos and maintain a calm and composed demeanor.",0,"Article: {}

596,"The 22-year-old striker was one of three AC Milan players targeted during their match against Roma on Sunday, which was halted for two minutes.
""If it happens one more time, I'm going to leave the pitch, because it's so stupid,"" the Italy international said.
""I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game.""
AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour.
Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to ""face this issue head-on"".
The punishment was criticised by Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who told the world governing body's website: ""They have not made any investigation of what happened. Just to give a pecuniary sanction is not valid, not acceptable.""
Balotelli, who has scored 11 goals in 12 games since his January switch from Manchester City, said the incident had altered his thinking about the best way to tackle the problem.
He told CNN: ""I always said if it happens in the stadium, I would just behave as if nobody had done anything and that I don't care, but now I think I've changed my mind a bit.""
There have been a number of incidents this season involving racial abuse of AC Milan's players.
A January friendly between Milan and Pro Patria was suspended because of racist chants aimed at Kevin-Prince Boateng.
The following month, Inter Milan were fined 50,000 euros after their fans were found to have abused their former player Balotelli in the Milan derby.

598,"Other shopping centres have increased the number of their security officers - and frisking people before they enter buildings, public transport vehicles and even churches is now common.
While the attack contributed to a fall in revenues in the country's important tourism sector, it has also boosted business in the private security industry.
""In a way it has [boosted business] because our clients have been concerned,"" says James Omwando, chief executive of the security firm, KK, of the new emphasis on security.
""They've taken on additional security officers, they've invested in new equipment - CCTVs and access control.""
The company's training centre on the outskirts of Nairobi is busier than ever. New recruits march for hours as they answer their instructor at the top of their voices.
Their clean-shaven heads, navy blue shorts, white socks and shoes are meant to help instil discipline.
""Even in terms of general recruitment we're now looking for a better educated, higher profile security officer who'll be able to understand what's being looked into because the challenges are many,"" says training manager Lucas Ndolo.
Ndolo, a former military intelligence officer, says even though understanding terrorism has always been part of the training, they have had to put more emphasis on it.
""We emphasise more on surveillance, detection, profiling and what security officers are looking for in the field,"" he says.
The soon-to-graduate guards are taking their lessons in a wooden classroom. A lot of the lessons taught are focused on preventing attacks.
""It is better to press the panic button when you realise that a person is gathering information, instead of you pressing the panic button when they've come to attack,"" a trainer lectures the class of about 20 trainees.
""You saw what happened at Westgate?"" he goes on, as they answer in the affirmative.
One of the first victims of the Westgate gunmen was the mall's security officer.
For security companies such as KK, one positive thing that has come out of the widely publicised attack is that they now collaborate a lot more with Kenya's security services.
""We get police officers coming here to help train our people. We've been in touch with the bomb people, the criminal investigation [and] anti-terrorism [officers] who come here to train our people,"" says Lucas Ndolo.
They also work together in conducting security operations.
That co-ordination is also beneficial to the police, who number about 80,000.
While the UN recommends a ratio of one police officer for every 400 civilians, Kenya has only half as many officers that would be required to meet that.
The Kenyan government has increased its security budget this year by 24% to $1.7bn (Â£1bn) from last year's $1.3bn. Part of that money is meant to employ 10,000 more police officers.
In the meantime, the estimated 300,000 private security officers are supplementing efforts to make civilians feel safer.
But not everyone can afford to pay for private security officers, and technology is a cheaper security solution.
""[Many people] are looking for alarms so that our vehicles can respond in the event of a problem,"" says KK's James Omwando.
The company's control centre is getting ever busier, he says, with the team monitoring phone calls and alarms going off at their clients' premises.
A government bid to buy and install CCTV cameras in Nairobi and Mombasa has been riddled in controversy and is yet to be implemented.
Most attacks have targeted the two major cities.
Walking through the streets of the capital you see security officers standing at buildings' entrances frisking people using metal detectors.
Female officers inspect women's bags and belongings while their male counterparts check the men.
But security analyst George Musamali argues that the checks are not thorough enough.
""When the item beeps, this person [should] remove what he's carrying,"" he says.
""Then if it's a dangerous weapon, you're supposed to have been given the action on what you need to do once you've identified that this person is carrying a weapon or something that is dangerous.
""You deny access, have him arrested, hand him to the police.""
He interprets the fact that there have been several attacks since security was improved to mean that the improved measures have not succeeded.
""But let's give credit to them because so far most of the cases we've seen are that these grenades are being lobbed from outside the vehicles - they're being lobbed from outside supermarkets.""
So in a way, he says, they have helped deter more attacks.
But security is still a concern for both locals and visitors.
The daring siege of the remote agricultural town of Mpeketoni, an hour's drive from Lamu island, in June reinforced fears that the government had not done enough to maintain security.
Partly as a result of that state of affairs, the country's growth projections for 2014 have been revised down by as much as 0.5% from 5.2%.
For the security industry however, this is likely to mean more business.",A lot has changed in Kenya since the attack at the Westgate shopping mall a year ago.,29253098,"The Westgate Mall attack in Kenya has led to an increase in security measures and business for the private security industry, with more clients hiring security officers and investing in equipment such as CCTV cameras and access control, but concerns remain about the effectiveness of these measures in preventing attacks.",0,"Article: {}

Turing said it will cut the price by 50% for hospitals and offer financial assistance to individuals.
However, the company will keep its list price at the new higher level.
In September Turing promised to reduce the price.
The pill costs around $1 for patients in Europe.
In statement Turing's chief commercial officer Nancy Retzlaff defended the company's move. She said that reducing the listing price would not have translated into saving for patients.
""Drug pricing is one of the most complex parts of the healthcare industry. A drug's list price is not the primary factor in determining patient affordability and access,"" Ms Retzlaff said.
Doctors though worry keeping the price so high will make it impossible for hospitals to stock the drug for the few patients who need it.
""The decision not to lower the price leaves patients in the same boat,"" said Dr Joel Gallant, medical director of special service at Southwest Care centre.
Though Turing is offering payment assistance for some patients, Dr Gallant said this could still leave patients waiting for treatment.
""Patients start the drug in the hospital, but then they need to be discharged with the drug. While they wait for patient assistance to be approved they could be re-hospitalised,"" said Dr Gallant.

The second TV debate between Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton will take place on Sunday evening in St Louis.
Mr Trump recently said he would not bring up stories about Bill Clinton's infidelities in the debate, after previously threatening to do so.
But in his video apology, he attacked the former president directly:
""Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked and shamed his victims.
""We'll discuss this in the coming days,"" he said. ""See you at the debate on Sunday.""
The day after a video emerged in which he suggested he could have any woman he wants because he's a star and so could just grab them by the pussy, Mr Trump is in a whole ocean of hot political water.
Enough, quite possibly, to sink any chance he had of winning the White House.
There is a violence in the phrases ""grab 'em by the pussy"" and ""you can do anything"" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening.
But this tape doesn't just offend women, judging from the reaction in the Republican party. It has offended a lot of men too. Whether those men will now withdraw their endorsements of him is yet to be seen.

606,"At first, it is hard to say exactly why. It is just that something doesn't feel quite right.  Ulsan feels like a place you vaguely know but can't quite figure out how.
And then it hits you. It is reminiscent of old photographs of European shipbuilding towns on rivers whose names are redolent of their history: in Britain, the Clyde, Tyne, Wear, Tees or Mersey.
In those pictures cranes and partly built ships towered over houses.  Thousands streamed from work together the moment a shift ended.
Nobody could forget how work enabled their lives because they saw, heard and smelled the place of work in every corner of the town.  It was their skyline.
That world of the heaviest of industry is no longer prominent in Europe. Even the biggest shipyards that remain (in Romania, Poland and Germany) are minnows compared to the yards of Asia.
If you look at the league table of shipbuilding companies in the world, five of the top 10, including all of the top four, are South Korean. The other five are Japanese and Chinese.
But the Hyundai Heavy Industries yard at Ulsan is the biggest of them all, giant cranes (aptly called Goliaths) dominating the skyline. The city pulsates with work and wages and the activities of far from idle hands.
The yard stretches for 2.5 miles (4km).  More than 60,000 people are employed there, constructing a huge ship every four or five days. These ships are the length of three football fields and are built in pieces each weighing hundreds of tonnes and then assembled around the clock.
In the dark, the yard glows across the town.  By day, the clang of construction rings out.  In the old European pictures and newsreels, workers would stream home on foot or maybe bicycles.  At Ulsan, they swarm out on motor scooters.
And when they are out, they drive the company car, eat in the company restaurants, laugh and cry in the company theatre, shop in the company department store, have their children in the company hospital, learn in the company schools, cheer for the company football team.
One of the longest-serving workers, Lee Sang-bok, told the BBC: ""Everything here is Hyundai. The highway I drive on is named after the founder of the company. The hospital and university is funded by Hyundai too.
""There's a town joke that it's just like the Hyundai Kingdom.""
He started work at the yard soon after it opened in 1974.
""I joined this company when I was just 16. In the past 40 years, shipbuilding really has become the centre of my life.  I devoted all my youth to this company.  It's become my identity"".
When South Korea industrialised in the 1960s and 1970s, setting in train its breathtaking transformation from poverty to affluence, it was done in a way to make Western ""free-market"" economists disapprove (though there is an argument that when the United States and Britain industrialised, they broke their own rules, too).
Government direction and government subsidy was the order of the day. South Korea's leader at the time, Gen Park Chung-hee, said ""do it"" and the corrupt rich he had jailed and threatened had no choice but to create the industries the government decreed.
It was ""directed capitalism"".
Under Park Chung-hee, scores of businessmen were arrested and charged with ""illicit profiteering"".
Property was confiscated.  Some were paraded with signs round their necks saying:  ""I am a corrupt pig.""
In return for freedom and renewed access to their money, the country's richest people were told to invest in new industries.
They had to sign an agreement stating:  ""I will donate all my property when the government requires it for the construction of the nation.""
Initially, the plan focused on six key industries (cement, synthetic fibre, electricity, fertiliser, oil refining and iron and steel), but in the early 1970s it turned to shipbuilding.
And this is where construction magnate Chung Ju Yung came in.
It should be said that he was not in that first wave of corrupt business leaders.  He earned his money the hard way, born a peasant who left home to labour on building sites and then to form his own construction company.
With the Korean War, he thrived.
Initially, he made cars in Ulsan but then turned to shipbuilding.  He was supremely ambitious and supremely confident - legend has it that he toured London seeking finance and when it was pointed out that South Korea had no shipbuilding industry, he took out a Korean bank note on which was a famous ship from the 16th Century.
He was also supremely careful with money.  In the company museum at the Ulsan shipyard, there are two pairs of shoes which Mr Chung is said to have worn for 30 years, getting them constantly repaired despite being a multi-billionaire.

How good are Kim Jong-un's hackers?
His parsimony has paid off.  It used to be said that Asian manufacturers competed with Europeans and North Americans on price but not on quality.
That is no longer so. The Ulsan yard is a builder of sophisticated vessels into which goes a lot of top research.
Metal gets bashed but lab mice get pushed, too.  It is heavy industry in which research and the latest technology is incorporated.
Lee Sang-bok is now an inspector at the yard.  His role is important.
Some of the vessels built there are carriers of liquefied natural gas.  Inside these ships go huge containers.  A leak of LNG would be catastrophic, igniting a huge explosion, so welds have to be inspected in microscopic detail.  This is what Mr Lee does.
It is a working life that has lasted 40 years.  It has given him and his family prosperity and pride.","To a European visitor, the city of Ulsan on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula seems like a throwback to some lost world.",32811866,"The article describes the vast and advanced Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea, which is one of the largest and most technologically advanced shipyards in the world, employing over 60,000 people and producing a new ship every four or five days, with a focus on the company's history, leadership, and cultural impact on the town and its people.",0,"Article: {}

She sustained fatal neck wounds and skull and brain damage, and died later in hospital.
The court was told she had been attacked in the bathroom of a flat in Fairlop Avenue in Canvey, belonging to Mr Withers.
On the day of the killing, Mr Withers, who described himself in police interviews as a paranoid schizophrenic, said he was briefly locked out of his flat, while Ms Pearce and Mr Ayres were inside.
When he got back in he claimed to have seen Mr Ayres swinging a hammer.
""I saw him hitting her with the hammer or something. I just saw him hitting like that,"" he told the court.
Defence lawyer Oliver Saxby, QC, said: ""It sounds like you weren't sure. Why did you say 'or something'?""
""That's best description I could give,"" Mr Withers replied.
He claimed he had then run from the flat to call the police.

She left her grandmother's house in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957 to go to the shops but never returned.
Convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore is suspected of her murder.
Det Supt Pat Campbell said: ""There are five distinct areas which have been identified which relate to items or structures within the silt layer.
""We are going to deploy divers from Police Scotland to remove these objects.""
He said specialists from the University of Dundee would then identify the objects and determine whether any of them are bones.
The first phase of the operation last week focused on a 170m (185 yards) stretch of canal at Carnbroe. Although it is 3.5m (11.5ft) deep, around 2m (6.5ft) of that is silt.
The team were joined by leading experts including soil forensic expert Prof Lorna Dawson and forensic anthropologist Prof Sue Black.
The search involved the use of ground-penetrating radar, sonar scanning and magnetometry, which identifies magnetic anomalies within the water and silt layer of the canal.
Bus driver and convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, who died in 2006, is suspected of murdering Moira and disposing of her body.
When she left her grandmother's house during a heavy snowstorm, she boarded a Baxter's bus that was driven by Gartshore.
Later that year, he was jailed for raping a 17-year-old babysitter.
In 1999, convicted child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as Moira's murderer.
Gartshore's own daughter Sandra Brown was convinced he was the killer and campaigned to have him charged.
In 2014, prosecutors announced that Gartshore would have faced prosecution for the schoolgirl's murder if he were still alive.
A previous search has focused on the theory that he may have buried her body in Monkland Cemetery, in the family plot of an acquaintance, but an excavation in 2013 found nothing.

Richard Foster's shot was diverted wide by Arunas Klimavicius, and from the resultant corner St Johnstone equalised, Shaughnessy heading home from close range into the corner.
But the joy for the home fans was short-lived as FK Trakai took the lead for a second time. A fantastic strike from Silenas from range flashed past Clark. The noise levels inside McDiarmid Park dipped once more.

Alston burst through from midfield and engineered a chance at the edge of the box, but his shot was deflected wide.

The court agreed that the ban sought to guarantee the concept of ""living together"" and the ""protection of the rights and freedoms of others"".
The court came to a similar judgement on Tuesday in the case of a Belgian woman who was contesting a bylaw brought in by three Belgian municipalities in 2008 that also banned face veils.
The European Court of Human Rights is an international court set up in 1959 and rules on individual or state applications alleging violations of the civil and political rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Belgian MPs approved the ban in 2011 on the grounds of security, to allow police to identify people, although some also argued the veil was a symbol of the oppression of women.
The latest case brought against Belgium was filed by Belgian national Samia Belcacemi, who lives in Schaerbeek, and Moroccan national Yamina Oussar, who lives in LiÃ¨ge.
Ms Belcacemi removed her veil fearing she might be fined or jailed, while Ms Oussar opted to stay at home, curtailing her social life, the court noted.
In its ruling, the court took into consideration a previous ruling it had made in a similar case brought against France over its imposition of a veil ban.
It noted: ""The court found that the concern to ensure respect for the minimum guarantees of life in society could be regarded as an element of the 'protection of the rights and freedoms of others' and that the ban was justifiable in principle, solely to the extent that it sought to guarantee the conditions of 'living together'.""
In the second case, the court made a similar ruling against the application brought by Belgian national Fouzia Dakir against the ban imposed by the municipalities of Pepinster, Dison and Verviers in 2008.
An appeal against the rulings can be lodged with the Grand Chamber of the court within three months.
In March, Europe's top court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), ruled that workplace bans on the wearing of ""any political, philosophical or religious sign"" such as headscarves need not constitute direct discrimination.
However, it said such bans must be based on internal company rules requiring all employees to ""dress neutrally"".",The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Belgium's ban on face veils does not violate the European Convention on Human Rights.,40567422,"The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that bans on wearing partial or total face veils in public in Belgium are justifiable in principle to ensure ""living together"" and protect the rights and freedoms of others, but the court also noted that the bans can be criticized for being overly broad and not targeting a specific security threat.",1,"Article: {}

East Sussex's fire authority said it would co-operate with the PCC but it believed collaboration could be achieved without elaborate structural change.
Ms Bourne said she had written to WSCC leader Louise Goldsmith and Phil Howson, East Sussex Fire Authority chairman, to request they begin to look at the feasibility of bringing both fire services under her authority.
""Just as we have one police force that effectively manages the county, we need to understand if one fire service not two could achieve the same,"" she said.
Ms Bourne's letter met with cross-party opposition from WSCC.

628,"The organisation said that councils stood ""ready, willing and able to take at least 2,000 refugees"".
All 32 local authorities have agreed to support a ""coordinated response"" to the humanitarian crisis.
But not all council areas may end up receiving refugees due to the complex needs of those arriving.
At least 18 local authorities could see the first groups of people arriving before Christmas, Cosla said.
The UNHCR estimates that 520,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Europe by sea so far this year, most braving dangerous journeys from North Africa and Turkey as they flee the conflict in Syria.
The Scottish government has pledged to accept at least 2,000 of the 20,000 refugees which the UK government has agreed to take.
Cosla president David O'Neill said there had been an ""unprecedented response"" from Scottish local government to the crisis.
He added: ""A number of councils had already been in discussions with the Home Office about their involvement in the Syrian Vulnerable Persons Relocation Scheme.
""The last three weeks has seen all Scotland's councils willing to support a coordinated response to what can only be described as a humanitarian crisis.
""For many councils that has seen them committing to taking refugees immediately.""
Glasgow City Council was one of a small number of councils across the UK that had already taken in Syrian refugees, with more than a quarter of refugees that have arrived in the UK through the scheme being housed there.
Cosla said Scotland's local authorities had an excellent track record in supporting the most vulnerable in society and already had effective systems and partnerships in place which makes them well placed to host Syrian refugees in their communities.
But it said it recognised the scale of the task and the need for detailed planning.
Cosla spokesman Harry McGuigan said: ""We fully recognise that this is not simply about matching people to houses, and that we must meet the wider needs of people so that they can integrate into our communities and build a safe life in Scotland.
""The response to this crisis will therefore be focused on balancing the urgency of the situation with planning the most appropriate ways in which councils and their community planning partners receive and integrate these extremely vulnerable people.""

The 34-year-old, who won 10,000m gold eight days ago, was swamped by his rivals in the final lap and Ethiopia's Muktar Edris broke clear to win gold.
Britain's Farah kicked again to take silver at the London Stadium in his final major track championships.
Britain's men won a stunning 4x100m relay gold as the women took silver.
""It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,"" Farah told BBC Sport.
""It didn't quite hit home until after I crossed the line and had a couple of moments to myself when I realised - this is it.
""I gave it all - I didn't have a single bit left at the end.""
Four-time Olympic champion Farah will finish his track career with a record of 10 golds and two silvers in major championships.
He is set to focus on marathons after his final track appearance at the 5,000m Diamond League final in Zurich on 24 August.
Gold and silver in the two 4x100m relays takes Britain's medal tally at London 2017 to four - Farah supplying the other two - but the hosts are still two short of UK Sport's target of six to eight.
Edris, 23, ran a superbly judged final 600m to claim his first major title with a sprint finish reminiscent of so many Farah triumphs.
After a brief burst from Farah's compatriot Andrew Butchart at the front of the race, the Ethiopian trio of Edris, Yomif Kejelcha and Selemon Barega moved up to box in the home favourite.
Barega fell back but Edris used Kejelcha as a pace-setter into the home straight before surging away while Farah battled for position with the resurgent Paul Chelimo behind.
Farah finally found open track but Edris was gone, with the Briton passing the fading Kejelcha and holding off Chelimo to salvage silver.
""The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I realised,"" said Farah.
""I was trying to cover every move but they had a game plan - one of them was going to sacrifice himself and that's what they did and the better man won.""
Farah has now lost just two of his 22 5,000m contests since 2011.
""I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,"" said Edris, who won in a time of 13 minutes 32.79 seconds to claim his first win over the Briton in five attempts.
""I am the new champion for Ethiopia, that's why I did the 'Mobot' [Farah's traditional celebration] - I am the next champion.""
1976 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist and BBC commentator Brendan Foster: ""We did say fatigue was going to get him. It has to come to an end. He hates losing.""
BBC athletics expert Allison Curbishley: ""In my head and my heart I didn't think anyone could genuinely beat Mo Farah but that 10,000m at the start of the week took so much out of him. Edris, we take our hat off to you. This man has beaten the legend that is Mo Farah in his own back yard.""
2005 marathon world champion Paul Radcliffe: ""He just doesn't have the pace in his legs anymore to be able to live with challengers like that but this isn't the end of Mo Farah in athletics. He has a new challenge ahead of him in the marathon.""
Two-time Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson: ""He has got to be hurting. But it has to end for everybody. In a couple of weeks or months, he will look back and say, 'that was awesome'.""
2004 Olympic 4x100m relay champion Darren Campbell: ""There are athletes out there who have won more medals, but the quality of those medals and for Mo to have led an event on his own... wow. I don't know how you can't see him as our greatest ever athlete.""

A disconsolate Farah dropped to the track as Edris mimicked his famous celebration, before finally picking himself up to complete a farewell lap.
Farah has come under scrutiny in recent years, with his coach Alberto Salazar under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.
The Briton also recently denied any wrongdoing after computer hackers revealed some of his blood samples had initially been flagged as suspicious, before later being declared normal.
After initial shock at the result, the crowd found their voice to give Farah a final warm send-off at the stadium he lit up with double Olympic gold in 2012.
""Back in 2008 at the Olympics I was so disappointed [at not making the 5,000m final] and I didn't know what to do with myself, whether to carry on with the sport,"" said Farah.
""I had to decide what it took to become a champion and that was to move to the other side of the world - nothing was guaranteed but I took that chance.
""This London crowd is amazing - there is no place like home.
""I have a few more races on the track, then I will take a short break and then this chapter of my life is closed.""
Elsewhere, Britons Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake finished fifth and sixth respectively in the high jump as Maria Lasitskene - the Russian competing as a neutral athlete - won gold with a leap of 2.03m.

The Republican who has won a string of primary contests has blamed the supporters of Democrat Bernie Sanders and denied responsibility for the violence. On Sunday, he said his campaign is ""not provoking"" and ""wants peace"".
He said no one gets hurt at his ""love-fest"" rallies.
A Quinnipiac University poll shows that Mr Trump is leading the way in Florida and tied with Ohio Governor John Kasich in Ohio ahead of crucial state primaries on Tuesday.
Here's what people are saying about Mr Trump and the violence at his rallies:
What Trump says about protesters at his rallies
Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders: Called Mr Trump a ""pathological liar"" after he said he had sent protesters to disrupt his rallies.
Florida Senator Marco Rubio: Said it is ""harder every day to justify"" backing Mr Trump should he win the Republican nomination and said conservatism is not about ""how angry can you get, how offensive you can be, how loud you can speak"".
Ohio Governor John Kasich: Asked his staff to make a list of Mr Trump's quotes promoting violence at his rallies and that Mr Trump's ""toxic"" tone makes it even more important for him to win his home state in the primary election on Tuesday.
Senator Ted Cruz: Said that the culture of violence is Mr Trump's fault, telling reporters that ""any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign"".
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio: Tweeted that there is no question Mr Trump a racist.
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton: Said Mr Trump's campaign consists of ""hate"" and ""fear"".
President Barack Obama:  Said over the weekend: ""Our leaders - those who aspire to be our leaders - should be trying to bring us together and not turning us against one another and speak out against violence and reject efforts to spread fear or turn us against one another. And if they refuse to do that, they don't deserve our support.""
House Speaker Paul Ryan: Said the violence at Mr Trump's rallies is ""very concerning"" and that candidates must take ""responsibility for the environment"" at their events
Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Republican candidate: Told NBC's Today programme that the violence could get worse, placing blame on the protesters, saying ""I think certainly if the protesters continue with their... tactics, there is a real possibility of escalation"".
Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee: Defended Mr Trump, condemning the Chicago protesters. ""I think it's ridiculous to blame Trump for a bunch of thugs out on the street,"" he told the Huffington Post.
Conservative pundit Ann Coulter:Tweeted that ""left-wing fascists violently shut down a peaceful Trump rally last night & Cruz + the entire media took the animals' side""",Presidential candidates for the 2016 race and other politicians are speaking out against Donald Trump after a string of violence at his rallies.,35790460,"The article discusses the violence that erupted at a Donald Trump rally in Chicago on Friday night, with Trump blaming the protesters and some of his supporters, while other Republicans and Democrats have condemned the violence and called for responsibility to be taken by all parties involved.",0,"Article: {}

634,"SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic.
It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's first programmes in November 1982, before being translated into English and shown on BBC One the following year.
Barry-born Young, now 70, has spent most of his working life in animation in California, working as an independent in Hollywood dominated by the big studios.
The former advertising copywriter has now produced a feature-length animation, Norm Of The North, and his next film project is close to his heart - about a former legend with his beloved Cardiff City football club.
A BEAR BEGINNING
In 1978, Young created SuperTed as a story to read to his young stepson Richard, who was afraid of the dark, at bedtime.
But the tales of the crime-solving superhero with special powers - and rivals like Texas Pete - soon got a wider audience.
""I went to the village hall one day to pick Richard up from play school and they said 'we love the SuperTed stories' and I said 'how do you know about those?'
""They said that 'he always tells us the story you told him last night'.
""We then got the books published, a couple of hundred were written, and then S4C came along and they wanted at least one thing which would travel all over the world - and it was successful.
""We became the first company to sell to Disney and we never looked back.""
Three TV series were made in the mid 1980s, with Derek Griffiths and Jon Pertwee providing the voices.
Young also launched Welsh-language cartoon Wil Cwac Cwac and helped develop Fireman Sam.
Now a new series of SuperTed is being planned, which Young again wants to make in Wales with some of the original team.
HOLLYWOOD BECKONS
Young and his wife Liz created Mike Young Productions - which later become Splash Entertainment - and moved to Los Angeles in 1989.
With much bigger rivals in Hollywood, he called it ""one of the most stupid, crazy decisions you could make"". But the company flourished.
As well as collaborations, its animations have included Chloe's Closet, Dive Olly Dive!, Hero:108, Growing Up Creepie, Pet Alien and ToddWorld.
NORM OF THE NORTH
Young's latest production is an animated feature film Norm Of the North about a polar bear.
Norm, who can talk but cannot hunt, goes to New York with a gang of lemmings for adventure and to fight a tourism development in the Arctic.
Although it does not have a big budget, the film uses the latest computer generated imagery (CGI) technology.
""We wanted to make something economic because I want the independents to have a chance and really get back into this business,"" said Young.
""It's all well and good having Disney, Pixar, Universal and DreamWorks but fundamentally they go a certain route but we can take more risks with what we do.""
The film, which includes voices from actors Rob Schneider and Bill Nighy, got its Welsh premiere at the Market Hall cinema in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, earlier this week.
CARDIFF CITY FAN IS THE RIGHT MATCH
He may live in California, but Cardiff City fan Young is now on the team making a film about one of the Bluebirds' most colourful characters.
Friday (The Greatest Player You Never Saw) is about the late Robin Friday, who played for Cardiff and Reading in the 1980s before he died aged 38.
""He made George Best look like an angel,"" Young said.
""We've put together finance for it and got some big stars in it and it looks like we'll be shooting it in England or Ireland later this summer.""","Once upon a time, there was a bedtime story - and it was the start of a long career for TV and film producer Mike Young.",35709407,"Mike Young, a Welsh animator and producer, created the beloved children's character SuperTed as a book for his stepson before it became a successful TV series in both the UK and the US, and he has since gone on to produce other popular animated shows and films, including the latest feature film Norm Of The North, and is now working on a film about the late Cardiff City footballer Robin Friday.",0,"Article: {}

638,"Two separate US teams have found success with an approach that homes in on a stable part of the flu virus.
That should remove the problem with current flu vaccines which must be given anew each year because they focus on the mutating part of the virus.
The proof-of-concept work is published in Science journal and Nature Medicine.
Studies are now needed in humans to confirm that the method will work in man.
In the meantime, experts say people should continue to receive an annual flu jab because vaccination is still the best way to protect yourself against infection.
Conventional flu jabs target molecules on the surface of the flu virus, but these are constantly changing.
Imagine the flu virus as a ball with lots of lollipops on stems sticking out.
The lollipops change year to year, but the stems remain the same.
It is the stems that scientists are now focusing on as a target for a universal flu jab.
Many different research teams have been testing potential candidates, but it has been a technical challenge to make something that can be used in a vaccine without involving the  lollipop 'head' of the hemagglutinin molecule.
This latest work seems particularly promising, according to Prof John Oxford, a flu expert at the University of London.
He called the results a ""red letter day"" for science.
""This is a leap forward compared to anything done recently. They have good animal data, not just in mice but in ferrets and monkeys too. And they've done it with the bird flu virus H5N1,"" he said.
""It's a very good stepping stone. Ultimately, the hope is to get a vaccine that will cover a pandemic virus.""
Prof Sarah Gilbert, Professor of Vaccinology at University of Oxford, said: ""This is an exciting development, but the new vaccines now need to be tested in clinical trials to see how well they work in humans.""
""This will be the next stage of research, which will take several years. So we are still some way from having better flu vaccines for humans,"" she added.","Researchers say they are closer to developing a vaccine to give life-long protection against any type of flu, after promising trials in animals.",34038808,"Two separate research teams in the US have found success in developing a universal flu vaccine that targets the stable part of the flu virus, known as the stems, which remain unchanged despite mutations, and while the approach shows promise in animal studies, further testing is needed in humans to confirm its effectiveness.",1,"Article: {}

640,"Smells of fresh sushi fill the meeting room, and Japanese artwork covers the walls of the house.
Outside, traditional Japanese plants and water features make it feel more like Japan than Northern Ireland.
Set up nearly two decades ago, in 1996, the group was formed to help Japanese people new to Northern Ireland to integrate, but its members say the society is about much more than that too.
On Saturday, the society held its first meeting of the year.
The society's secretary, Séan Greer, said many members joined because they had lived in Japan for a time.
""I used to live in Japan, for about nine years in total, and I came back just at the end of 2003,"" he said.
""I wanted to keep my contact with Japan, I heard about the society and looked them up. People are interested in Japanese culture for a lot of different reasons.
""It might be the language, for a lot of people it's food, for a lot of younger people it's the animation and manga (Japanese cartoons). Everything they do seems to be a little bit different or sometimes very different from our own and therefore it's sort of endlessly fascinating.""
There was plenty of culture on show at the meeting, including a performance by a group of Japanese taiko drummers from Londonderry.
One of the group's founders, Fiona Umetsu, said it was an exciting art form, mixing both music and performance.
""Taiko is a part of nearly every Japanese festival that you see, and it's a brilliant part of their summer,"" she said.
""When I lived there I saw it and thought it was amazing, and was lucky enough to be able to join a local group.""
The society was joined by a very special guest - students visiting Belfast from Rikkyo University in Tokyo joined in the festivities.
For many of them, it was their first time visiting Belfast and they told me they were keen to stay.
""Belfast is very fantastic and an exciting city, many students say they want to retire here in Northern Ireland,"" their professor said.
The Japan society's chairperson, Junko McNeely, said the group provides a way for people who are learning Japanese to practise with native speakers.
""The purpose is to introduce Japanese culture, anything like that to get local people interested in Japan, but it's also a place to communicate and have entertainment with Japanese people as well,"" she said.
Séan Greer said the society also allows Japanese visitors to find out how the western world views their culture.
""If you got to Japan the first question a Japanese person will ask you is:  ""あなたは、日本どう思いますか"", which means, 'what do you think of Japan?' and they're really curious about what others think of them,"" he said.
""So when they come here they can learn a little bit more about that, and realise what non-Japanese people find interesting about Japan.
""We ourselves are interested to know what other people think of Northern Ireland and we're keen to show them that it's a welcoming place as well.""","Tucked away in a little guest house next to a manufacturing firm in Glengormley, County Antrim, members of the Japan Society of Northern Ireland chat away - some easily switching in and out of Japanese and English.",34169307,"The Japan Society in Northern Ireland, established in 1996, provides a platform for people to learn about and share Japanese culture, language, and traditions, with a focus on integration and cultural exchange between Japan and Northern Ireland.",0,"Article: {}

642,"A BBC analysis suggests 195 out of 402 official bathing waters are patrolled between July and September.
The National Water Safety Forum said it was ""impractical"" for every beach to be covered.
The absence of lifeguards was raised as a concern after the deaths of seven men at Camber Sands in 2016 but an inquest concluded they may have drowned anyway.
There is no formal list of which beaches have lifeguards as the Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) only publishes details of the ones it patrols. Local councils and private land owners provide others.
Seven people died in two incidents at Camber Sands in East Sussex in summer 2016.
The families of five men, who died in the second incident in August, described the victims as physically fit and competent swimmers.
An inquest into the deaths, which concluded in June 2017, heard the RNLI had recommended that Rother District Council employ lifeguards after a risk assessment in 2013.
The inquest was also told the RNLI then rejected a request to put lifeguards on Camber Sands 16 days before the August deaths, citing a lack of resources.
Lifeguards now patrol the beach. However, the inquest concluded that the men may still have drowned even if there had been lifeguards.

RNLI lifeguards rescued 2,082 people across the UK and Jersey, and saved 127 lives, in 2016.
The charity, which lists the beaches it patrols on its website, said it worked with councils and other beach owners to determine lifeguard cover.
""There may be times when we will approach a local authority or beach owner if there has been something that has happened on that beach, but the majority of times it will be due to the local authority or beach owner coming to us"", a spokeswoman said.
The RNLI said it would not be possible to put lifeguards on to all bathing waters and services ""need to be judged on a needs basis as opposed to a cost implication"".
The cost to train a RNLI lifeguard is Â£712 plus a further Â£812 for equipment.
The water safety forum said some of the beaches not covered by lifeguards may not attract significant numbers of people or pose a significant risk.
""Water-related accidents occur on inland waters as well - it's very important that this is not forgotten,"" a spokeswoman said.
Seeing children swimming and jumping off rocks into the sea, Alexa Mullane was concerned that there were no lifeguards at Durdle Door beach in Dorset.
The managing director of a health supplements company visited the beach, as well as Lulworth Cove and Studland with her family, including two baby nieces - during the good weather in June.
She saw ""lots of kids swimming quite far out and also jumping off really high rocks into the sea"".
""I definitely thought that it wasn't safe,"" Ms Mullane said. ""You could see the rocks under the water and it was scary to see them jumping from so high into the water.""
James Weld, whose family owns Lulworth Estate which owns Durdle Door, responded: ""The signage makes it very clear that people should not jump or 'tombstone' from Durdle Door because of the serious risk of injury.
""Like many beaches in the UK we do not have lifeguards on duty, our coastal safety signs clearly advise all visitors of this fact.
Mr Weld added that beach wardens and rangers, who are not trained lifeguards or first-aiders, patrol Lulworth Estate's beaches regularly.
BBC England's data unit analysed a list of beaches patrolled by lifeguards, RNLI and otherwise, using data provided by the RNLI, the Beach Guide and local councils' websites, as of 7 July 2017.
The list was compared to the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs' list of designated bathing waters in England, with inland waters - such as Lake Windermere and Hampstead Heath in London - stripped out.

645,"Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday.
Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways.
Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography.
The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories.
Lee was described by his wife as a being ""loving and normal young man"".
Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his ""own strange pleasure"", they were serious matters as ""children were abused for these images to be made"".
He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that ""society would not tolerate such behaviour"".
Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community.
Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images.
Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for.
On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating.
During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images ""for perhaps the last nine years"".

So it is that he did something rather surprising - slowing and softening spending and welfare cuts now having promised faster and deeper cuts in the run up to the election.

The sports college closed in August, while Skelmersdale College's Westbank campus, owned by Newcastle College, is also unused.
The decision follows a comparative study by Network Rail of both sites and one near the Concourse shopping centre.
Skelmersdale's original railway station closed to passengers in 1956.
The council - which owns Glenburn Sports College - said Skelmersdale could get two direct trains to Liverpool per hour under the plans it has made in partnership with Merseytravel and West Lancashire Borough Council.

He said the preferred location was big enough to allow for the possibility of future expansion.
He added: ""It has good highway access and good connectivity to the town and the surrounding area.""

649,"On Monday, the BBC's Panorama programme uncovered several safety concerns, from staffing levels to waste storage.
The Mannin Branch of the Celtic League has called on the Manx government to campaign for a full, independent inspection of the plant in Cumbria.
Sellafield says the site is safe and has been improved with significant investment in recent years.
A spokesman added: ""Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.""
The Isle of Man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.
Due to its potential impact on the Manx fishing industry, the Manx government began monitoring radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea in 1989.
A government spokesman said: ""Seafood fished in Manx waters can contain traces of radio-nuclides associated with effluent discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea, therefore these are monitored regularly to confirm that they remain well below maximum safe limits.""
The BBC investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant.
He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants.
The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about ""the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos"".
A spokesman added: ""However we are content that Sellafield Ltd and the nuclear regulators are trying to improve the safety situation.

Taylor told BBC Radio Kent: ""If the chairman picked up the phone and said 'Peter, that's it, you're not having any longer' I would totally understand.
Media playback is not supported on this device
""The majority of the fans probably want me out. What I would like to have here is a lot more time.""
Gillingham have only won three of their 16 league games this season and are currently two points from safety.
Taylor led the club to 17th place in League One last season after taking charge in October, initially as interim manager, and subsequently targeted a mid-table finish this season.
The 61-year-old received the backing of Scally last month but accepts that it is hard for supporters to show patience while they are struggling.
""I understand the fans' frustrations. We were all expecting a better season than we are having,"" he said. ""We are in a bit of a hole and need to dig ourselves out of it.
""I really do feel that there is a good squad here but we are not showing it at the moment. I would love longer.
""One win in 12 league matches is not good enough. I lost my job at Palace when we had one defeat in five.
""If the chairman sacked me I couldn't complain and I wouldn't complain. Me and the chairman wouldn't fall out either. I am not going to walk away. I am desperate to turn it around and I do honestly feel I will do. I am very determined to.""
Taylor overhauled Gillingham's squad during the summer, making eight permanent signings.
He says injuries have played a part in their struggles so far this season, with goalkeeper Stuart Nelson (thumb), utility man Aaron Morris (hamstring), midfielder Doug Loft (Achilles) and striker Danny Kedwell (knee) all missing chunks of the campaign.
""If we'd have had no injures whatsoever then I would expect to be gone by now,"" Taylor, who had a spell as England's caretaker manager in 2000, said. ""There are reasons why we have got a lack of form and confidence.

He said the move was ""apparently"" in response to him saying the party's current leadership ""couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding"".
But a spokesman said his membership had lapsed earlier this year.
And party leader Paul Nuttall said the businessman - who has suggested he should be made party chairman to shake up the party's policymaking and campaigning - was causing ""negative and damaging publicity"".
In a letter to Mr Banks, Mr Nuttall said the party's ruling NEC had agreed to meet the businessman later this month to discuss his ideas but this invitation could be withdrawn if he continued to criticise UKIP and its leadership.
He added: ""I should make clear that, whilst I am open to working with you on improving and enhancing our party, the party chairmanship is not on offer.""
Mr Banks, who gave Â£1m to the party ahead of the 2015 general election, has been sceptical about the leadership of Paul Nuttall and has recently spoken of founding a new political movement to ""drain the swamp"" of Westminster politics.
He also suggested he could stand against Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only MP, by using a recall petition to trigger a by-election in his Clacton constituency.
But Mr Carswell played down the importance of Mr Banks' announcement, telling the BBC: ""It's always very sad when one of UKIP's 40,000 members leaves the party for whatever reason.""
Referencing previous claims that he had prevented former UKIP leader Nigel Farage from being knighted, Mr Carswell added: ""I have no more say in NEC decisions at UKIP than I do in who gets a knighthood.""
On Mr Banks' suggestion that he could stand against Mr Carswell in Clacton at the next general election, the MP said: ""Each time I've stood there've been some wonderfully colourful characters on the ballot paper.
""I even had a chap who changed his name by deed poll to Lord Ha Ha Woof Woof. I'm sure at the next election there'll be some colourful characters too - the more the merrier.""
Apology to squash clubs
But in a statement, Mr Banks claimed UKIP had ""somehow managed to allow my membership to lapse this year despite having given considerably more than the annual membership fee over the past 12 months"".
""On reapplying I was told my membership was suspended pending my appearance at a NEC meeting,"" he said.
""Apparently, my comments about the party being run like a squash club committee and Mr Carswell have not gone down well.
""I now realise I was being unfair to squash clubs all over the UK and I apologise to them. We will now be concentrating on our new movement.""
However, a UKIP spokesman said Mr Banks was notified last year that his membership was due for renewal at the start of October but he ""chose not to renew despite reminders"".

Antoine Griezmann put Atletico ahead and Denis Cheryshev equalised for Valencia before Torres struck.
Valencia had Anderlan Santos sent off on 80 minutes before Yannick Carrasco completed the scoring.
Neville suffered just a second defeat in seven games as goalkeeper Diego Alves endured a tough night.
Atletico made the brighter start so it was no real surprise when they went ahead in the 24th minute.
They squandered possession 25 yards from goal and Griezmann let fly with a low shot that crept inside the near post with home goalkeeper Alves slow to react.
The lead lasted just four minutes, however, before Valencia scored as a long pass was cushioned by the head of Paco Alcacer to Cheryshev, who lashed home a left-footed drive from 15 yards.
Cheryshev lifted a shot over the crossbar from another Alcacer header seven minutes before half-time as Valencia grew in confidence.
Alcacer had a chance to put Valencia ahead just before the hour mark when he latched onto a pass by Sofiane Feghouli but fired straight at goalkeeper Jan Oblak.
Moments later Alves made up for his earlier error with a fantastic, one-handed save to keep out a powerful effort by Luciano Vietto.
But the keeper could do nothing to stop substitute Torres, who was making his 300th Atletico appearance, putting his side ahead with 18 minutes remaining as he slid in at the far post to turn the ball home after Jose Maria Gimenez flicked on a corner.
Santos saw red for two bookable offences with five minutes remaining and Carrasco made it 3-1 five minutes later when he fired straight at Alves, who allowed the ball to creep in under his legs.

His deception was uncovered when solicitors went to interview him three days later, only to find him gone.
Moore, 28, from Ilford, east London, handed himself in three days later.
Southwark Crown Court heard he had set up a fake web domain which closely resembled that of the court service's official address.
He then emailed the prison's custody inbox with instructions for his release.
The court heard Moore registered the bogus website in the name of investigating officer Det Insp Chris Soole, giving the address and contact details for the Royal Courts of Justice.
Prosecutor Ian Paton said: ""A lot of criminal ingenuity harbours in the mind of Mr Moore. The case is one of extraordinary criminal inventiveness, deviousness and creativity, all apparently the developed expertise of this defendant"".
The judge, Recorder David Hunt QC, described the behaviour as ""ingenious"" criminality.

656,"Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.
Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing.
She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue.
But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason.
Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York.
""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'""
Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.
""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'
""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'""
Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.
The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.
The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation.
He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.
He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.
""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me.
""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.
""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.""
But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.
The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.
Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.
The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.
""Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,"" the Rev Butts says. ""She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.""","It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.",10355908,"Harper Lee's only published novel, ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" was published 50 years ago and remains a classic, with its exploration of the ""conflict of the human soul"" in a segregated Alabama setting during the Civil Rights movement, despite Lee's decision not to write again, which her close friend and retired minister Thomas Lane Butts attributes to her desire to protect her privacy and not compete with herself after creating a great work.",0,"Article: {}

Her lawyers have pleaded not guilty on her behalf, and when her trial began she said only that she would ""leave everything"" to her defence team.
But in court, asked if she killed her husband, she said there was ""no mistake"", the Mainichi reported.
The 70-year-old said she committed the crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she obtained the cyanide from a business associate.
""I wasn't given any money after I married him,"" the Japan Times quoted Ms Kakehi as telling the court on Monday. ""I have no intention of hiding the guilt. I will laugh it off and die if I am sentenced to death tomorrow.""
Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide.
The investigation began when Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married.
A post mortem examination subsequently found traces of cyanide in his body, and investigators then began examining the deaths of other men linked to the pensioner.
She is now on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend who later died of cancer.
The men were all aged between 70 and 80 when the alleged crimes took place between 2007-2013.
Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths.

He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead.

Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go.
However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap.
Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement.
The result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace.
Alonso said: ""It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead.

The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade.
At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion.
Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.
It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.
The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.
Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.
Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.
Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.
Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.
Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.
Vettel said: ""The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.
""I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.""
Button said: ""It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.
""When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.
""It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.
""But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.""

663,"The 53-year-old has come under scrutiny since information on Sir Bradley Wiggins' authorised use of banned drugs to treat a medical condition was released by hackers.
And further questions about Team Sky's doping controls led MPs to claim its reputation was ""in tatters"".
""It shouldn't even need saying, but we all back Dave B 100%!"", Thomas tweeted.
""I've known him a long time and I wouldn't want anyone else leading Team Sky,"" the 30-year-old said.
Peter Kennaugh agreed with Thomas, adding: ""I think all the riders on Team Sky would join me in saying they are completely behind Dave Brailsford.""
""He's the leader of our super Team Sky,"" added Elia Viviani.
Michal Kwiatkowski, Owain Doull and Luke Rowe also tweeted their support for Brailsford.
It follows reports that some riders have lost confidence in Brailsford and considered asking him to resign.
Brailsford has denied any wrongdoing, saying TUEs ""do not cross the line"" over performance-enhancing drugs.
Last week a Parliamentary select committee heard evidence about the former Team Sky doctor who received a 'mystery package' for Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2011, Richard Freeman.
Team Sky responded saying that they were a clean team who abide by the rules.
""We are proud of our stance against doping. We believe our approach to anti-doping is rigorous and comprehensive,"" they said in a statement.
BBC sports editor Dan Roan
With the future of Sir Dave Brailsford - and perhaps even Team Sky - uncertain after months of damaging revelations, this is an attempted fight-back, with several riders closing ranks around their under-fire boss at the request of management.
However, it has not escaped attention that the team's leading man, Chris Froome, is yet to make clear his support, instead tweeting about a meal he enjoyed in South Africa. And if that is an act of defiance, it could place even more pressure on Brailsford as he tries to cling to his job.

Freeman, meanwhile, has also received the support of a former colleague.
Dave Readle, who was a sports psychologist at the governing body's high performance programme from 2008 to 2014, and worked closely with Freeman, told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that the doctor ""has been thrown under the bus"".
MPs at last week's select committee hearing were told how Freeman had failed to keep medical records of treatments for riders - a possible breach of General Medical Council rules, according to the UK Anti-Doping Agency - and ordered large quantities of the corticosteroid triamcinolone, that may have outstripped clinical need.
Freeman administered Wiggins' TUEs, and took delivery of the mystery medical package in France 2011. It has also been reported that fellow doctors at Team Sky blocked him applying for a fourth TUE for Wiggins, and that he was in charge of medical supplies when testosterone patches were delivered to British Cycling in 2011, apparently in error.
He has denied any wrongdoing, and is thought to be preparing written submissions to Ukad's questions.
Freeman withdrew from giving evidence to the select committee on the eve of the hearing last week due to ill health. But Readle said: ""Richard has been hung out to dry. He is a loyal friend, a man of honesty, integrity and loyalty, and this is a tough time for him. All this negative publicity, he's in a state of shock.
""The fact that no one's come out to support him, after all the help he's given riders, it stinks.
""I spent a lot of time with him and everything he did was above board, there was no cutting corners.""
When asked why Freeman may have failed to keep medical records, Readle said that the intensity of the workload while treating large numbers of athletes and other staff may have meant that the doctor's administration sometimes slipped.
""You get bombarded with stuff in elite sport, he wouldn't have done it deliberately. Richard had lots of athletes to treat,"" he said.","Team Sky riders are ""100%"" behind team principal Sir Dave Brailsford, according to Geraint Thomas.",39185863,"The article discusses the ongoing controversy surrounding Team Sky and Sir Dave Brailsford, with several riders publicly expressing their support for him despite recent revelations of banned drug use and doping controls, while some have lost confidence in him and considered asking him to resign; the article also highlights the response from Team Sky and the former Team Sky doctor Richard Freeman, who has received support from a former colleague despite facing criticism for his handling of medical records and treatments for riders.",0,"Article: {}

664,"The prime minister has said curbs on EU citizens' freedom of movement in the UK would be a red line for her and she has ruled out a points-based system.
However, 770,000 EU nationals living in the capital should be eligible for a visa to ensure their future in London, the chamber of commerce said.
They make up 15% of London's employees.
EU nationals also contribute more than £26bn to London's Gross Value Added - the value of goods and services produced - and they pay direct taxes of about £7bn a year.
Their departure from the workforce ""would be economically harmful, impacting on various key industries and putting pressure on public funds"", the chamber's research suggests.
It could particularly hit construction, where foreign workers make up a third of the workforce, and financial services, where they make up a quarter.
In that sector there are acute worries post-Brexit about the future of passporting rights - an agreement that allows UK businesses to offer financial services anywhere in the EU and the wider European Economic Area including Norway, Iceland and and Lichtenstein, without the need for licences in individual countries.
Although this has yet to be clarified by the government, it is thought EU immigrants will in future have to enter the UK under the same arrangements applicable to non-EU migrants now which imposes minimum salary levels and insists on firm job offers.
Research suggests that by 2020, London may have lost access to 160,000 migrant workers, and there would be a loss to economic output of nearly £7bn a year and direct tax contributions of about £2bn.

City Hall said the mayor was committed to keeping London open to foreign talent, but he is yet to commit to special immigration measures.
Speaking at an event launching the report, Ben Johnson, an adviser to the mayor on business, said the ability to attract foreign workers was vital along with ""privileged"" access to the single market.
He said the priority was to secure the future of the workers here now, although there was no explicit support from him for any of the business proposals.
Greater London Authority Conservative group leader Gareth Bacon said: ""Now that we have won the war over Brexit and have re-secured the power to govern ourselves, we have a great opportunity to shape our immigration policy in ways that best suit our needs and ambitions.

Organisers of the meeting at Longsight Saath Saath are demanding an inquiry.
GMP said it has no plans to issue any further statements on the training exercise staged at the Trafford Centre.
The scenario for the mock suicide bombing was by an extremist Daesh-style organisation although GMP had said the event was not linked to any specific terror threat.
Syed Azhar Shah, who chaired the meeting attended by about 30 people, said GMP assistant chief constable Garry Shewan's apology was not enough and ""only acceptable"" if those responsible resigned.
He said while the training exercise was a good idea but it was ""shocking to portray Muslims as terrorists"" and that only one group would commit terrorist acts.

666,"Celia Castedo told Bolivian media said she had warned that the plane had barely enough fuel to reach the destination in Colombia.
Ms Castedo is in Brazil where she is seeking asylum.
The crash killed 71 people, including most of the Chapecoense football team.
The plane was taking the team to Colombia for the final of a regional tournament when it ran out of fuel, plunging into a mountainside near the city of Medellin.
In a leaked tape, the pilot, Miguel Quiroga, can be heard warning of a ""total electric failure"" and ""lack of fuel"".
In her letter (in Spanish) published in the Bolivian media, Ms Castedo, who worked in air traffic control, said she had no authority to stop the doomed flight, saying that was with Bolivia's civil aviation agency.
She said that instead of authorising the flight, she had tried to stop it, accusing unnamed superiors of a cover-up.
""I was subjected to harassment and pressure from my superiors... who ordered me to change the content of the report which hours earlier [before the flight] I had presented,"" she wrote.
""Based on a careful examination, I had made five observations, one of the most important of which referred to the fuel economy of the flight, which happened to be equal to the flight time.""
Bolivia's Public Works Minister, Milton Claros, dismissed Ms Castedo's allegations.
""There were no observations made to the flight plan,'' Associated Press quoted him as saying, with the minister accusing Castedo of fabricating the document after the crash to cover-up her own errors.
Other Bolivian officials have urged the Brazilian authorities to return her, with one saying Ms Castedo was trying to escape justice.
The head of the flight's operator, Gustavo Vargas, has been arrested over the crash.
Just six people survived. One of them, crew member Erwin Tumuri, said an initial stop for refuelling in the northern Bolivian city of Cobija had been dropped by the pilot.

""I would want him in the team and in the squad. He has certainly got another tournament in him.""
Rooney has scored a record 53 goals in 115 appearances for his country.
The Manchester United man was made England captain in August 2014 but has come under scrutiny for a number of disappointing displays.
He found the net from the penalty spot after just four minutes against Iceland but underperformed for most of the game in Nice as England went out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage.
In the wake of the defeat, Germany legend Lothar Matthaus said it was time for Rooney to retire from international football.
""Sadly, when his team needed him, Rooney was not that leader,"" he said.
""You need someone who can provide the impetus and rhythm. I thought Rooney could take the role but, when it mattered, he wasn't able to do it.""

""I think once we reflect a bit more, Wayne will remain a big player in the squad and will help with the development of the younger players around him,"" insisted Lampard, who won 106 caps for England.
However, the former Chelsea and West Ham midfielder thinks he needs to work out his best position for both club and country.
Under Louis van Gaal, Rooney began to play in midfield as well as a striker but that may change now Jose Mourinho is manager of Manchester United.
""I don't believe 31 is an age where you need to change position because of being 31, said Lampard, now playing in the United States with New York City.
""I think Wayne still has the pace, the ability and the knowhow to play as a striker, but the choice will obviously be between him and his managers.""
Rooney has already said he would continue to be available for international selection.
England's next game is a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Slovakia on 4 September.
England should not be afraid of appointing another foreign coach as a successor to Roy Hodgson, said Lampard, who played under Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson and Italian Fabio Capello during his time with the national side.
""Ideally, as a proud Englishman, you'd love an English manager,"" he said.
""But I think, in the modern world, you have to accept that, if the options aren't there, you have to look abroad.
""It wouldn't bother me if a foreign manager took an England team forward and was successful, not at all.""
England are looking for a new manager as Englishman Hodgson quit immediately after the defeat by Iceland.
Under Eriksson, England reached the quarter-finals at three successive major tournaments, while Capello led England to the 2010 World Cup and a 4-1 defeat by Germany in the second round.
""I think the best man for the job would be the starting point for picking the next manager,"" added Lampard, who would prefer a youthful boss, adding: ""Over the last 10-15 years, when I was playing, we weren't setting a new tone.
""I would look to a younger, forward-thinking manager who has a real strong idea about how he wants to play, plays good football, generates a good spirit in the team and go that way.""
But he believes it will not be a straightforward task for the Football Association.
""I can't give you the name, which is the problem, but they will have to have a confidence in the decision they make,"" said Lampard.

Abdirahman Mohamud Hassan, the director general of the Puntland maritime police force, said: ""There has been discussion going on after the gunfight this afternoon... We took our forces back and thus the pirates went away.""
The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said the crew members were released ""unharmed, without the payment of a ransom"".
A pirate confirmed the release was made without a ransom payment, according to Reuters.
However, John Steed, a former British army officer who has spent years negotiating the release of piracy hostages in Somalia, told the AFP news agency they had been made an offer they could not refuse.
Mr Hassan earlier said that ""pirates"" on board the tanker had opened fire on Thursday after authorities tried to intercept a boat believed to be carrying essential supplies, such as food.
Four people were wounded in the exchange of fire on Thursday, the BBC has learned.
The Puntland authorities deployed local forces in the area in an attempt to assist rescue efforts for the hostages on board the vessel, the district commissioner said.
The vessel was carrying oil and was owned by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite conflicting reports over the flag it was sailing under, he added.
On Wednesday, the European Union anti-piracy naval force, which is helping to tackle piracy in the region, said the hijackers had been demanding a ransom.
Authorities were then still trying to determine whether the gunmen, who have not given any details about the size of the ransom, were organised pirates or fishermen whose equipment was destroyed by illegal fishing vessels, as they had claimed to be.
The EU force earlier made contact with the ship's master, who said his vessel and crew were being held captive anchored off the coast of north-east Somalia. The ship's tracking system has reportedly been switched off.
Piracy off the coast of Somalia, usually for ransom, has reduced significantly in recent years, in part because of extensive international military patrols as well as support for local fishing communities.
At the height of the crisis in 2011, there were 237 attacks and the annual cost of piracy was estimated to be up to $8bn (Â£7bn).
However, some smaller fishing vessels have recently been seized in the area.
In 2015, Somali officials warned that piracy could return unless the international community helped create jobs and security ashore, as well as combating illegal fishing at sea.
Some Somali fishermen turned to piracy after their livelihoods were destroyed by illegal fishing from foreign trawlers, which benefited from the lack of a functioning coastguard in the country following years of conflict.","Somali pirates who hijacked an oil tanker have released it without condition, according to officials.",39295936,"A tanker carrying oil was hijacked off the coast of Somalia by pirates who exchanged gunfire with naval forces before releasing the crew without a ransom payment, marking the first such incident in the region since 2012, despite efforts to reduce piracy in recent years.",0,"Article: {}

684,"He said that a rugby player has many ways to score a try but the route he so often chose was the shortest route: ""Straight over a fella. Sometimes you need to run at people rather than around them - you need to put a bit of manners on them.""
Foley - or Axel to his mates - died suddenly on Sunday in Paris and the game in Ireland, and beyond, is going to take some time to try to comprehend this outrageous loss.
When the news broke you thought of his family, of course. You thought of all those people at his beloved Shannon RFC, where it all started for him. You thought of his legion of fans at Munster, who hold him up as one of their greatest and most influential sons.
The numbers of his playing career are impressive - 201 appearances for Munster and 62 Tests for his country, 86 European ties, three European finals, three semi-finals.
No list of his accomplishments would be complete without cataloguing the five All Ireland League titles he won with Shannon. Those victories meant as much to him as anything. Hard rugby played in front of passionate rugby people. This was where Foley was at his happiest. It was what Foley was born to do.
And yet the number that jumped out at you on this grim day was 42 - his age. It's no age.
He had taken his first steps in coaching with Munster - he was head coach and in Paris for Munster's opening fixture of the Champions Cup against Racing 92 - and though he had a lot to learn, the story of his playing career told you emphatically that one day he would learn it all and achieve greatness as a coach, too.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Ten years ago he wrote: ""If I'm going to be remembered I'd like to be seen as a stubborn player, somebody who wouldn't give in. There were times during my career when I could have called it quits and gone off and done other things - but there was always a goal there, always something to achieve.
""Once there's something to chase, I'll chase it.""
Foley underplayed his ability. For sure, he was a stubborn back-row forward, a number eight that would never take a backward step for anybody. But he was intelligent. His reading of rugby games was extraordinary at times.
""The smartest rugby player I have ever had the honour of playing with or against,"" said Keith Wood, the former Ireland captain and Foley's boyhood friend.
It was easy to see where Foley got it from. He was born into a rugby family - or more particularly, a Shannon family.
Shannon people will tell you there's a difference. They'll say there's no rugby family is like a Shannon rugby family - and therein lies the beauty of rugby in Limerick because Young Munster people say the same thing about themselves, as do those in Garryowen, Old Crescent, Bohemians and many other clubs in this rugby-mad city.
Foley loved the intercity rivalry. It was bred into him.
Long before he brought his uncompromising will to the Shannon and Munster dressing room, his father had done it already.
Brendan Foley did not have a lot as a kid, but what he had was a devotion to the game, a hunger to become good at it and an ability to pass on its joys to his son and daughter, Rosie, who won 39 caps for the Ireland women's team.
""As a small boy I was sent to games with him,"" Foley recalled. ""I carried his bag into the changing room at Thomond Park [Shannon's and Munster's home ground] and I minded the spot where he used to tog out - I was very protective of it.""
When Foley started playing for Munster in October 1994, he sat in the same spot where his father had sat.
He excelled. He was never the quickest or most athletic back-row forward - far from it - but he had, in Wood's words, ""a sixth sense, an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time"".
He flitted in and out of the Ireland team over the years, a succession of coaches unappreciative of his qualities. In Munster, they loved him unconditionally.
His leadership was legendary. When Munster suffered a setback he'd tell his team-mates to stick the memory of the loss into what he called the ""bitterness bank"". He used bitterness in a big way. They still use it now at Thomond Park.
At the beginning of the European Cup in 1995, Munster were an irrelevance. Their form in their bear pit in the middle of Limerick tended to be thunderous and many big wins were achieved, but there was no consistency, no apparent hope of them achieving anything.
The Foleys and the Mick Galweys and the Peter Clohessys - the Munster totems - drove the team forward. Foley instilled his principles into the new wave - Alan Quinlan, David Wallace, Ronan O'Gara, Peter Stringer, John Hayes, Paul O'Connell, Donncha O'Callaghan.
A team in Foley's own image had been created.
Munster made the Heineken Cup final in 2000 and 2002, losing both. They made the semi-finals in 2001, 2003 and 2004 and lost them, too. People in the province wondered if they would ever achieve their ultimate goal.
Foley never wondered or never had thoughts of surrender. He drove on, as honest and ferocious as ever.
In the 2006 Heineken Cup final he captained the team to victory against Biarritz at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and wrote his name in Munster history just as his father did when playing in the side that beat the All Blacks at Thomond Park 28 years earlier in the most storied Irish rugby game of them all.
His loss is profoundly shocking. His list of achievements is long, but nowhere near as lengthy as the queue of people who wish to explain what he did and what he meant.","Anthony Foley once described rugby as, basically, ""a street fight with a ball"".",37672789,"Axel Foley, a renowned Irish rugby player and coach, died suddenly at the age of 42, leaving behind a legacy of impressive playing and coaching achievements, including 201 appearances for Munster, 62 Tests for Ireland, and five All Ireland League titles, as well as a reputation for his uncompromising will and leadership abilities, which inspired a generation of players and cemented his place as one of the greatest and most influential sons of Irish rugby.",0,"Article: {}

686,"The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday.
It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal.
Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it ""a shambles"".
According to the draft, Labour would:
On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids.
First it would introduce an ""immediate emergency price cap"" of £1,000 a year.
The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee.
The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election.
A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few.""
The draft document is seen by some senior Labour figures as the most left-wing manifesto since the party was led by Michael Foot in 1983.
It certainly appears to be the most detailed in a generation with a 20-point plan for workers' rights alone.
Many individual policies are likely to be popular - not every privatisation is seen as having been a success and polling suggests the commitments to renationalise the railways and cap energy prices aren't as controversial as critics would claim
But opponents and sceptical voters will await further detail behind the assertion that everything has been costed.
Privately, many Labour MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn will get the manifesto he wants but in return he must take full responsibility if voters find it less appealing than he does .
Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign.
These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported.
On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called ""bedroom tax"" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21.
The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66.
The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph.
A Conservative spokesman said: ""This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed.
""The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk.""

687,"Police officers are allowed to search people for items such as drugs, stolen goods and weapons.
But there has been controversy over ""consensual searches"", where people are searched without any legal basis.
If approved by parliament, the code will end consensual searches from May.
Ministers asked an advisory group of experts to draft the code following a BBC Scotland investigation which revealed that hundreds of children under the age of 12 were being subjected to consensual stop searches.
The new code states that stopping and searching members of the public is a ""significant intrusion into their personal liberty and privacy"".
It must therefore be done for a good reason, and be both ""necessary and proportionate"", it says.
This means that the officer must have a ""reasonable suspicion"" based on ""facts, information and/or intelligence"" that the person being searched is likely to be carrying an illegal item.
But officers will not be allowed to search someone based purely on their appearance - for example age, race or gender - or because they have previous convictions.
The codes states: ""A stop and search will not be carried out in a manner which is abusive, discriminatory, or which amounts to harassment or intimidation.""
The person being searched must understand why it is being carried out, with the officer also required to carry it out ""with respect for individual needs - including religious and cultural values and beliefs.""
And officers must be ""fully accountable"" for the searches they carry out, with all stop and searches accurately recorded, and open to scrutiny.
The code also sets out specific guidelines for dealing with children and vulnerable adults, and acknowledges that that they may require additional support to help them comprehend and participate in the search process.
It says: ""In taking a decision to search a child or a young person, a constable must treat the need to safeguard and promote the well-being of that child or young person as a primary consideration.
""Where a constable believes it to be more harmful to a child or young person to carry out a search than not, then the search should not proceed and other measures to safeguard them should be considered.""
It also says that officers should use ""age-appropriate terms"" when speaking with children and young people and avoid the use of technical or legal language, unless required to do so by law.
The Scottish government announced on 4 November 2016 that there is not enough evidence to support creating a police power to search children for alcohol at this time.
The situation will be re-assessed after the code has been in force for 12 months
A code of practice underpinning the use of stop and search is required under The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said stop and search was a valuable tool for combating crime, but that it was important to strike a balance between protecting the public and recognising people's human rights.
He said: ""This new code is about finding that balance and maintaining the trust between the police and the public.
""With this new code we will ensure stop and search is carried out with the fairness, integrity, respect and accountability that we expect from our police officers in all of their duties.""
Research published by Edinburgh University in 2014 showed police in Scotland were far more likely to carry out stop and searches than their colleagues in England and Wales.
The figures also suggested that young people were the most likely to be searched.
But the number of stop-and-searches has fallen dramatically since then, with 888 consensual searches and 20,665 statutory searches conducted between 1 April and 30 September last year.
This compared with 450,173 consensual searches and 192,470 statutory searches in 2013/14.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said Police Scotland had made ""real progress"" on the issue, and ""very much welcomed"" the new guidelines.
He added: ""We are currently training all our officers in advance of its introduction to ensure we are fully prepared.""","Police officers will only be able to stop and search people when they have ""reasonable grounds"" to do so under new rules published by the Scottish government.",38582400,"The Scottish government is introducing a new code of practice to regulate police stop and search powers, which will require officers to have a reasonable suspicion and to treat individuals with respect and dignity, while also reducing the number of consensual searches conducted on children and vulnerable adults.",1,"Article: {}

689,"But this is where you find the alleged mastermind of Turkey's failed coup, the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
And he has broken his customary seclusion to give rare interviews defending himself against the accusations levelled by his nemesis, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Who was behind Turkey coup attempt?
Turkey police and officials purged
How mobiles beat tanks and saved Erdogan
We were greeted at the Golden Generation Worship & Retreat Center by polite, well-spoken men who serve as the first line of gate-keepers to the revered preacher and writer.
They belong to organisations inspired by Mr Gulen, not run by him, a testament to the strength of his personality and the appeal of his message. He advocates a Sufi-based Islam of tolerance that emphasises education and promotes business.
In Turkey, though, critics view this style of leadership as a threat, saying he wields much unelected political influence through followers who have heavily penetrated the bureaucracy and have links to media and business.
The retreat sprawls over 25 lush green acres (10 hectares) in the foothills of the Poconus Mountains. But the cleric, it was emphasised, occupies only a single, spartan bedroom in one of the buildings. We were shown a desk, a small bed and a small mat.
He met us in an adjacent room, seated beneath a framed admonition to ""Continue to Love"", written in Arabic calligraphy. He rose to greet us but his strength failed him and he fell back onto the sofa.
The real gatekeeper is Mr Gulen's doctor, who gave him medication so he could manage the interview.
Although his heart condition and diabetes have made him very frail, his language was anything but.
He condemned the coup attempt as treason, claiming that ""even if at the helm of the country there are people who would like to replace me and suppress me and oppress me at the level of blood-sucking vampires, even then I do not want to remove them with anti-democratic means"".
""This is my attitude toward any and even the idea of the consideration of a military coup.""
It may be that he sees President Erdogen as a vampire after his blood.
The two men once banded together to curb the power of Turkey's secular military.
But a few years ago Mr Erdogan became suspicious that Mr Gulen's followers were driving a corruption investigation that targeted his inner circle. He moved to stamp out any alternative power centre, even if it was another Islamic one.
Since then he has been purging them from state institutions. Mr Gulen called this a ""witch-hunt"" which accelerated after the failed coup.
""It's not possible to talk about democracy any more,"" he said of reported excesses. ""This kind of regime resembles more of a clan and a tribal administration.""
Without naming Mr Erdogan, he compared him to dictators such as Hitler and Saddam Hussein.
But he counselled his followers to remain peaceful because ""society is already polarised enough, don't make it worse"".
Ironically Mr Gulen fled to America in 1999 amid accusations of trying to overthrow the secular government. Now it is an Islamist one demanding that the US send him back.
He seemed unfazed by Mr Erdogan's plan to lodge a formal extradition request. He declared it would be politically motivated rather than legally sound, and therefore would not get much attention in a country where ""the rule of law reigns supreme"".
The issue, however, is getting much attention: already it's led to some sharp exchanges between Turkish and American officials. And it could create further headaches for the US government, especially if the evidence provided does not stand up in an American court.
Once again Mr Gulen sought to rise above the political to the spiritual.

Mikel has until Friday, 30 November to respond. Chelsea have indicated he will not deny the charge but will request a hearing to ""explain the mitigating circumstances"".
The evidence for Chelsea's allegation towards Clattenburg came from their midfielder Ramires who, when interviewed, explained that his instinctive reaction was to seek confirmation from Mikel as to what the referee said.
Mikel, who was being spoken to by Clattenburg, was much closer than Ramires and did not hear what it is suggested was said to him.
The two assistant referees and the fourth official revealed they did not hear any of the comments Clattenburg was accused of making, despite being linked up to the referee via microphones.
An FA statement also said the complaint by Mikel's team-mate Ramires was ""made in good faith"".
Clattenburg, 37, has always maintained his innocence and the Metropolitan Police dropped its own inquiry earlier this month.
He missed four weekends of Premier League matches while the FA investigated Chelsea's complaint.
""I am looking forward to putting this behind me and concentrating on refereeing in the Premier League and other competitions,"" said Clattenburg.
""The messages of encouragement from those inside and outside of the game have helped me through the most stressful time of my professional life.
""To know you were innocent but there was the opportunity for it to wreck your career was truly frightening.
""Racism has no place in football and this experience should not discourage those to speak out if they genuinely believe they are a victim of abuse.
""However, there are processes that should be adhered to in order that any investigation can be carried out in a manner that is fair for all parties involved.
""I know first hand the ramifications of allegations of this nature being placed into the public domain ahead of a formal process and investigation. I hope no referee has to go through this in the future.""
What has happened over the last few weeks should not overshadow the fact the on-pitch relationship between match officials, players and managers is the best we've ever known it
Responding to the announcement, a Chelsea statement said: ""Chelsea Football Club accepts the Football Association's decision regarding Mark Clattenburg and welcomes the fact that the FA recognises the club and players were correct in reporting the matter.
""The club accepts the case is now concluded and notes the FA states the allegation was made in good faith.
""Chelsea FC has a duty of care, as do all employers, to act responsibly when such allegations are reported by employees.
""We did not take the decision to lodge a formal complaint with the FA lightly and followed the correct processes and protocols throughout.""
Referees' union Prospect, on behalf of Clattenburg, are asking Chelsea for a full apology and compensation.
Police dropped an investigation into the alleged comments towards Chelsea's Mikel and Juan Mata in the Premier League match at Stamford Bridge last month.
Chelsea initially suggested Spanish midfielder Mata had also been verbally abused by Clattenburg, before deciding there was insufficient evidence to support these claims.","The Football Association has cleared referee Mark Clattenburg of using ""inappropriate language"" towards Chelsea midfielder John Mikel Obi.",20420934,"The Football Association has cleared referee Mark Clattenburg of racism charges after an investigation found no evidence to support the allegations made by Chelsea player John Obi Mikel, while charging Mikel with misconduct for making false accusations against Clattenburg.",1,"Article: {}

695,"Judge Clifford Bellamy said Leicester City Council had not undertaken a ""robust risk assessment"" of the boy's great-great-uncle who had been jailed for sexual abuse.
The city's family court heard the nine-year-old had a ""complex"" home life.
The judge said the boy should be placed into foster care.
A city council spokesman said the child has already been moved to an ""appropriate placement.""
The judge explained in a written ruling the boy's mother had mental health problems and separated from his father several years ago and was now in a lesbian relationship.
His father has dwarfism, an alcohol problem and had been convicted of having unlawful sex with a 16-year-old girl when he was 21.
Updates from this story and more from Leicestershire
The boy had been living in the care of his great-great-uncle, who was in his 70s, who had been given an eight-year jail term in the early 1990s.
He had admitted unlawful sexual intercourse and a serious sexual offence with his niece when she was aged between 11 and 13.
Judge Bellamy said the man had been released on licence after serving five years and was assessed as ""low risk"".
The concerns were raised after the judge was asked to make decisions about the long-term future of the boy at the hearing.
He said the council had lacked ""any sense of urgency"" in bringing the case to the attention of a family court judge.
A city council spokesman said: ""This case does not appear to have been handled appropriately, or with the urgency required, and our own review is under way.

He added he was also in talks with ""senior writers"" about a play on the main Olivier stage addressing similar themes.
Norris was speaking at a public debate on diversity in UK theatre at the NT in London.
Act for Change, which organised the event, revealed statistics that showed over the Easter weekend only one actor with a ""visible disability"" had been noted across all theatre sectors, (the West End, regional and subsidised). That had been at the National Theatre.
Interviewed on the Olivier stage, Norris said he was considering whether to introduce quotas to improve diversity within the organisation.
""There is a big argument about whether there should be quotas. Across this year we will be testing that to see how desirable it is,"" he said.
""Our policy is quite simply to reflect this city and this country. That means in terms of gender, BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] and disabled. That's not a difficult policy.""
Norris said that in 2014/15 the National's BAME on-stage figure was an unusually high 33% - driven in part by shows such as Behind the Beautiful Forevers and Here Lies Love. He said his aim was for 20% in any given year.
He admitted that it was ""much harder"" to achieve the same figures in permanent backstage staff.
Pressed on the issue of quotas, he said: ""The last thing I'm saying is no.  What I want is for this community to represent the country accurately and if that's the best way of doing it then, yes - why not?""

After second preferences were counted and transferred, Khan received a total of 1,310,143 votes (56.8%) and Goldsmith 994,614 (43.2%).
The Labour candidate gained 44.2% of first preference votes, with Goldsmith securing 35%. Green Party candidate Sian Berry came in third with 5.8%. Full details of London's results are available here.
The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning - and the London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies.
In the London Assembly election, Labour secured 12 seats while the Conservatives ended up with eight. The Green Party had the third most votes and have two seats in the Assembly, as do UKIP. The Lib Dems claimed the remaining seat.
The SNP will retain its grip on government, after having claimed 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs - up six on their 2011 result. Overall, the SNP will occupy 63 of the 129 seats at Holyrood, with the Conservatives becoming the second-largest party on 31. Labour took 24, the Greens six (all from the regional lists), and the Lib Dems five.
Some of the SNP's gains came at Labour's expense in Glasgow, which now represents a clean sweep for the governing party. It also took Edinburgh Northern and Leith from Labour.
But it faltered elsewhere in the capital, losing Edinburgh Central to the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western to the Lib Dems. The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP.

As the interactive vote-share map above demonstrates, the Labour party's share of the constituency vote in Scotland was concentrated in areas where it largely failed to get over the finish line ahead of the SNP.
The SNP, on the other hand, dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies.
The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too. With regional results factored in, the party gained 16 seats on the previous election in 2011 and will now be the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament.
That the Lib Dems doubled their constituency seat count, from two to four, masks a dismal night for the party, which lost its deposit in 48 constituencies.
For the first time since the parliament's creation in 1999, the Lib Dems are fifth in the political pecking order.
With six MSPs - one less than it had in 2003 but four more than the 2011 election - the Scottish Greens now stand as the fourth largest party in the Holyrood chamber. It won all of its seats through the regional list system and not through the constituency vote.
Labour is likely to seek to form a minority government after winning 29 of the 60 seats in Thursday's election, according to first minister Carwyn Jones.
Just one constituency changed hands, when Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood captured the Rhondda from the governing party.
The biggest shift in Welsh politics was the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats.

In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most. The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent.
A total of 124 councils were up for re-election, in part or in whole.
After all the results were counted Labour lost 18 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, and gained control of Bristol.
The Conservatives lost a total of 48 council seats. The party lost control of two councils, but gained control of Peterborough.
The Lib Dems gained 45 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control.
UKIP gained 25 more council seats - but was not able to convert these gains into control of any council.
At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour. It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour.

704,"Mr Swinney said the UK government's recent spending review placed ""unprecedented pressure"" on public expenditure north of the border.
The UK government said Scottish ministers would have £390m more in spending available to them next year.
Mr Swinney is due to present his 2016-17 spending plans on Wednesday.
The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month's spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11.
Mr Swinney said 4.2% of that reduction would come between now and 2019-20.
He said: ""The chancellor (George Osborne) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020, and more than £1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade.
""We have demonstrated that the UK government didn't have to take this approach. Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor.
""Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days.
""Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on.""
Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would ""not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession"".
He added: ""In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level.
""These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government.""
Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: ""The Scottish government will have £390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to £750m if you include its own underspend.
""The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £30bn.
""One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government.
""The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland, rather than grievance.""
Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: ""Ahead of the most important budget since devolution, it's time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity posturing with something real.
""Telling us about pre-election giveaways now and cuts later isn't good enough. This needs to be a long-term budget.

""Future players will see the headlines and see it's not an option at all,"" doubles representative Fleming told BBC Scotland on Wednesday.
""I think if anyone is found to be doing it, that should be them. They shouldn't be playing again.""
Fleming, 31, and his partner Jonathan Erlich, were beaten 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 in the first round of the Australian Open on Wednesday by Robin Haase and Fernando Verdasco.
""The key thing about sport is that it's pure, you don't know the outcome of any given match, and that's what people pay to come and watch,"" he added. ""You never know what's going to happen. That's key  and they have to preserve that.
""I've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.""
The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport.
""Your guess is as good as mine,"" he said of those involved. ""There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty.
""It can just be people throwing money on a match.""
Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne.

Keith Pelley, the European Tour's chief executive, said that the tournament's host Rory McIlroy had strongly endorsed the Inishowen peninsula venue.
""Rory absolutely loves Ballyliffin,"" said Pelley, who described the venue as ""stunning"".
""Some months ago, Rory and I spoke about the possibility of the Irish Open coming to Ballyliffin.
""I have worked with athletes for 25 years and have never seen anybody who is more giving of his time than Rory. Having his name associated with the tournament is something we are proud of, and we do not take it for granted.""
The European Tour chief said that he played at Ballyliffin on Friday before checking out hotel accommodation in the area.
""It's a fantastic venue - 36 outstanding holes. Then I drove around the region and visited the hotels.
""The golf course is spectacular, but the support we will receive from the region will be similar to what we have received at Portstewart.

Next year's Irish Open will be held from 5-8 July - two weeks before the Open at Carnoustie.
Ballyliffin's bid for the tournament was framed as a cross-border initiative with strong backing being provided by both the local councils from Donegal and Derry & Strabane.
The Donegal venue's Old Course staged the 2008 Irish Senior Open but next year's tournament will be staged on the 22-year-old Pat Ruddy-designed Glashedy links which will be lengthened to more than 7,400 yards for the event.

707,"""The US is an extremely diverse society and attitudes toward LGBT people differ hugely across the country,"" a travel advisory from the UK reads.
Newly passed laws in both states allow businesses to refuse service to LGBT people.
The advisory comes from the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
In North Carolina, legislation passed by Governor Pat McCrory invalidates previously passed legislation from Charlotte, that state's largest city, that enacted LGBT protections.
His new law states that transgender people must use public bathrooms according to the gender on their birth certificates. Mississippi's law has a similar bathroom provision and also protects dozens of forms of businesses and services from being prosecuted by the government for refusing to serve LGBT people.
It is ""both frightening and embarrassing that one of our nation's staunchest allies has warned its citizens of the risks"" of travelling to the US, said Ty Cobb of the Human Rights Campaign.
""It is now more clear than ever that these terrible measures are not only harming individuals and taking an economic toll on the states, but are also causing serious damage to our nation's reputation, and the perceived safety of LGBT people who travel here.""
Companies are curtailing their businesses in the states because of the law, and several entertainers have cancelled performances in both states over the law.
More than a dozen US states have passed or considered ""religious liberty"" laws, sparking controversy and protest across the country.
Supporters argue the the bills protect religious beliefs, but most critics say they are actually legalised discrimination in the face of gay marriage becoming legal last year.
Republican front-runner for the US presidential race Donald Trump has weighed in on the bathroom provisions of the laws, saying people in North Carolina should be allowed to use the bathroom they feel is appropriate.

Serena, 35, won 6-4 6-4 to pass Steffi Graf in the all-time list of major winners since the Grand Slams accepted professional players in 1968.
The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber.
Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles.
""Congratulations Serena on number 23,"" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era.
""I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win.
""I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love.""
Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: ""There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration.
""She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too.""
Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation.
She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2.
It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting.
The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve.
In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances.
She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3.
The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically.
There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide.
Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals.
Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009.
""No, because I guess I've been here before, ""she said. ""I really enjoy seeing the name 'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.""
Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent:
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Serena Williams is the length of time she has been winning Grand Slam titles. The first came on 11 September 1999 in New York; the 23rd on 28 January 2017 here in Melbourne.
The match itself will quickly be forgotten; but never the achievement. Richard Williams used to beg tennis clubs to part with their old balls when he started to put his daughters through their paces in the Los Angeles district of Compton, and now Serena has more Grand Slam singles titles than anyone who has ever played the game, with the exception of Margaret Court.
Williams is now just one behind the Australian - who was watching on the Rod Laver Arena - and in the view of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, it is a record she could ""shatter"" before her playing days are done.

711,"The judge also fined him 1m shekels ($289,000; Â£171,000) and ordered that 560,000 shekels in assets be seized.
Olmert's lawyers said he was innocent and would appeal. If he is unsuccessful he will become the first former head of government in Israel to be jailed.
The 68-year-old was convicted in March over a real estate deal that took place while he served as mayor of Jerusalem.
The Tel Aviv District Court found he had accepted a 500,000-shekel ($145,000; Â£86,000) bribe from the developers of a controversial apartment complex, known as Holyland, for which planning and zoning laws were changed, and another 60,000 shekels for a separate project.
By Yolande KnellBBC News, Jerusalem
This jail sentence is a dramatic fall from grace for a man who was once one of the most powerful figures in Israel.
It is also likely to end any hopes of a political comeback for Ehud Olmert.
Recently, as he criticised the Israeli government's handling of peace talks with the Palestinians, it seemed he still held ambitions to return to public life.
However, the judge in this case said that Olmert's crimes involved ""moral turpitude"", meaning he will be barred from office for seven years after serving his sentence.
In his memoirs, Olmert claims he came very close to a peace deal with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in 2008.
But in his three years in office he also took Israel into two bloody, armed conflicts - the 2006 war with the militant Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, and a three-week offensive on Gaza in 2008-2009 that left some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead.
Now corruption has been added to Olmert's political record. However, many Israelis hope his sentencing is a sign that their country is cleaning up its political culture.
Ten other government officials and businesspeople were convicted alongside Olmert. The sentences handed down on Tuesday against six of them ranged from three to seven years.
Judge David Rozen said bribery offences ""contaminate the public sector"" and ""cause the structure of government to collapse"".
He added: ""People who receive bribes give rise to a feeling of disgust and cause the public to despise the state's institutions. The taker of bribes is like a traitor who betrays the public trust that was given to him - trust without which a proper public service cannot be maintained.""
The judge said Olmert had made a ""large contribution to the country"".
But he described his offences as ""noxious"" and said he was guilty of ""moral turpitude"", which under Israeli law would preclude him from running for public office for seven years after finishing his jail term.
Olmert reportedly stood quietly in the courtroom with his head bowed. His lawyers had sought a non-custodial sentence.
The judge told him to report to prison on 1 September, effectively giving his lawyers time to lodge their planned appeal.
""He did not take a bribe. He did not receive a bribe. He sees himself as innocent, and it is with those feelings that he will be going to the Supreme Court to appeal,"" Olmert's lawyer, Eli Zohar, told reporters.
Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, who served as Olmert's deputy prime minister and foreign minister said: ""It is a difficult day when a former prime minister is sentenced.""
""I have complete trust in the court and law enforcement officials, and the public should as well.""
Olmert served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, until a flurry of corruption allegations led to his resignation.
He was acquitted of most of the major charges eventually brought against him by prosecutors but was also found guilty of breach of trust and given a one-year suspended jail sentence.

713,"Thousands of sufferers and their dependants will be able to get damages from a £350m pot over the next decade.
Those diagnosed after 25 July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible.
Ministers said it was a ""major breakthrough"" to ""end an injustice"".
Mesothelioma is a fatal disease with average survival rates of about nine months after diagnosis.
It is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation.
About 2,400 people die every year of the disease and numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000.
While some people have taken legal action to recover damages, many are deterred because of the stress involved. The speed with which the disease takes hold means many die before their cases are heard.
Victims and their families have, up to now, been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded £20,000.
Under the proposed new fund, which must receive parliamentary approval, UK claimants will be entitled to 75% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, expected to be about £115,000.
Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer.
""This scheme represents a major breakthrough for the many victims of this terrible disease, who have been failed by successive governments and the insurance industry for decades,"" said Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning.
""It will end an injustice that has left many tragic victims and their families high and dry.
""The aggressive and terminal nature of this disease, coupled with the fact we're approaching a peak in cases in the coming years, makes it imperative that we get this legislation in place as soon as possible,"" he added.
According to government calculations, 900 people are likely to qualify for support in 2014, with a further 300 expected to get assistance in each of the following nine years.
If the Mesothelioma Bill currently before Parliament is passed in the next few months, it is hoped the first payments will be made next July.
There has been anger that ministers have proposed a cut-off point for claims and that those diagnosed before 25 July last year, when the scheme was first announced, will not be eligible.
Officials have defended the move, saying that an open-ended commitment to compensate all those afflicted by the disease would simply not be affordable.
Those suffering from other asbestos-related conditions, such as asbestosis, will also not be eligible.
One campaign group said the proposals were a ""drastic improvement"" on the current support available.
But it said the cut-off point seemed ""arbitrary and harsh"" and some victims felt it was unfair that they were not able to claim 100% of the value of a civil settlement.
Mesothelioma often takes 40 to 50 years to manifest itself after exposure and most of those being diagnosed are males in their 60s and older.
The scheme will be paid for by the insurance industry. All insurers will have to register on a voluntary database established in 2011 listing employers' liability insurance policies, both current and historic.","Victims of mesothelioma, an aggressive form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, will be able to claim far larger compensation under a new fund.",25152063,"The UK government has announced a £350 million fund to provide damages to thousands of sufferers and their dependants of mesothelioma, a fatal disease caused by asbestos exposure, over the next decade, with eligibility limited to those diagnosed after 25 July 2012 and unable to sue former employers due to insurance details being lost or employers going bankrupt.",0,"Article: {}

In the palace's second statement on the claims, it said those made about the duke were ""without any foundation"".
The Mail on Sunday has named the woman as Virginia Roberts. The BBC has not been able to verify her identity.
Palace officials made a second statement after further details about the allegations were published in Sunday newspapers.
An initial statement had said ""any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors"" by the duke was ""categorically untrue"".
BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt described the latest palace denial as ""quite remarkable"".
He said it was understood Prince Andrew was now back in the UK after a skiing holiday in Switzerland, and it was likely his first public appearance would be at a reception at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, later this month.
This situation ""has the potential to seriously damage Prince Andrew and the institution he represents,"" our correspondent added.
The woman behind the allegations says she was forced to sleep with the prince when she was under age, and on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 1999 and 2002.
A US lawyer, meanwhile, says he is planning legal action against the woman.
Alan Dershowitz, who was also named in the court documents, told the BBC he wanted her claims to be made under oath.
Mr Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said: ""My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in court. If she believes she has been hurt by me and Prince Andrew, she should be suing us for damages.
""I welcome that lawsuit. I welcome any opportunity that would put her under oath and require her to state under oath these false allegations.""
Mr Dershowitz also said he thought Prince Andrew should take ""whatever legal action is available"" to clear his name.
He added: ""You cannot allow these false allegations simply to remain out there, and you cannot allow people who make false allegations to have the freedom to continue to make them.""
He previously told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the allegations against Prince Andrew must be presumed to be false, and that he had only met the prince at public occasions.
The woman has issued a statement through her lawyers, saying she was ""looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse"", adding that she was ""not going to be bullied back into silence"".
The court document alleges that Epstein sexually trafficked the woman making her available for sex to ""politically connected and financially powerful people"".
Prince Andrew and Mr Dershowitz are two of three well-known men named in the court document who it alleges had sexual relations with the woman.
The prince, who is fifth in line to the throne, has previously been criticised for his former friendship with Epstein, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for soliciting a minor for prostitution.
The prince and Epstein were photographed meeting in December 2010, after the tycoon had served his prison sentence, and the prince has also visited Epstein at his Florida home over the years.
The prince later had to apologise for his friendship and stepped down as the UK special representative for trade and investment.
US citizen Virginia Roberts waived her anonymity in an interview with the Mail on Sunday in 2011, claiming she had been sexually exploited by Epstein as a teenager.
She also claimed to have met Prince Andrew on several occasions, but the paper said there was no suggestion of any sexual contact between Virginia Roberts and the prince.","Buckingham Palace has ""emphatically denied"" Prince Andrew had sexual contact with a woman who claims she was forced to have sex with him under age.",30670837,"Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, was named in US court papers regarding the handling of a case against financier Jeffrey Epstein, with allegations that he had sexual relations with a woman when she was underage, which the palace has denied, and the prince is now facing potential legal action.",0,"Article: {}

721,"A crane was used to lift the scanner into place and the operation took several hours to complete.
The multi-million pound investment has been partly funded by charitable donations.
By 2012, the scanner appeal had raised £2m, and back then the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said it expected the machine would be in place by 2013/2014.
At that stage, the total capital cost was estimated at £4m, with additional annual running costs of £1.9m.
The then Health Minister Edwin Poots committed £2.75m towards the project in November 2012 and described it as a ""vital service"".
He said he was delighted that it was finally going to be installed and that the delays had been caused by practical issues.
""Obviously it is something that the Belfast Trust were dealing with but the hospital that it is being placed in is a very old building,"" he said.
""The first problem that they came across was asbestos and there was considerable asbestos removal to take place, so that was the first delaying factor.
""Another thing that impacted on it was that the actual scanner is a considerable weight and the ground had to be piled for the scanner to be installed.
""That piling was taking place actually within a building, so one can understand that that was a huge engineering challenge to take on.""
Mr Poots said that once it was installed it would have ""life-saving consequences"" and make a ""huge difference"" for the services provided at the children's hospital.

722,"A shocking claim, based on figures from the Office of National Statistics.
The data for England and Wales shows that in 2015, hunger and/or dehydration were a factor in 828 patient deaths in hospitals and care homes.
But that doesn't mean all of these patients starved to death or died of thirst, experts at the ONS were quick to point out when I spoke with them about it.
Malnutrition may be recorded on the death certificate as a factor contributing directly to a death when it was a complication of a different underlying cause, such as cancer of the stomach, for example.
If you are very sick, it might not be feasible or desirable to eat and drink. Having a disease such as advanced cancer can cause malnutrition.
That's not to say that patients who are terminally ill should have fluid and nutrients withheld. On the contrary, guidelines make it clear that even if a patient can't eat or drink they should still be provided for.
They were drawn up after reports revealed some patients at the end of life were being denied this basic right when they were put on a care protocol called the Liverpool Care Pathway.
The LCP was scrapped in 2015 after relatives complained that their loved ones had been put on it without their knowledge and denied fluids, which hastened their deaths.
Another dark period in history for the NHS was the Stafford Hospital Scandal, where hundreds of patients died amid appalling levels of care between 2005 and 2009.
An inquiry identified terrible and unnecessary suffering, including examples where patients had been provided with food and drink, but it had been left out of their reach.
Joan Morris, 83, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in December 2006 with a chest infection.
Her family said that food and water had been left on a table instead of being given to her.
Another patient, Tom Wilhelms, resorted to drinking from a vase.
In response to the Francis Inquiry into the failings at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust, the government published new hospital standards including around nutritional and hydration care.
And it asked the Care Quality Commission to make sure that the hospitals and care homes it inspected were following these standards.
The CQC's first dedicated review was in 2012.
It inspected 500 care homes and 50 hospitals in England and found 83% of care homes and 88% of hospitals it inspected met people's nutritional needs, which means patients were provided a suitable choice of food and drink and given help to eat and drink when they needed it.
It says this shows things have improved.
Prof Sir Mike Richards, CQC Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: ""We expect the food provided to be nutritious, to meet people's dietary requirements, and for this to be included as part of patients care planning while in hospital, and we look closely at this on our inspections. Where we find this is not happening or identify concerns that people's nutritional needs are not being met we take action and have a range of enforcement powers at our disposal where required.""
Age UK agrees that there's been progress, but says malnutrition in the NHS is still a big issue.
Lesley Carter, who works of the charity and is programme manager of the Malnutrition Task Force, says a third of people going into hospitals and care homes are already malnourished or at risk of malnutrition when they are admitted.
""That means they are already vulnerable to start with.""
She said that on busy wards, mealtimes might get rushed or overlooked without the right staffing.
""Older people in particular might need help to eat and drink, and they aren't always getting this. Food can still be left out of reach.
""Some hospitals have employed nutrition nurses to spot those patients that need help, and nutrition assistants to help with the feeding, which is good.
""But it is time consuming to feed someone properly.""
She says friends and families have a responsibility to keep a check on elderly loved ones too.
""We all need to realise that it's not natural to lose weight as we age.""
Although elderly people should be encouraged to eat a healthy diet, she says this can backfire.
A salad might be worse than cake in terms of nutrition for someone who is old and frail and has a poor appetite, for example.
""Some residents in care homes are being given low fat yoghurt and semi-skimmed milk when instead they should get full fat milk.""
Food for thought.

723,"She's just been in the studio with Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, trying to make him giggle while he goes about some serious radio presenting business; and she's daydreaming about her favourite UK delicacy - a sandwich from Pret.
When she discovers she's in the same building as the BBC newsroom, the star politely asks for a guided tour.
""I never get to do stuff like this,"" marvels the singer, as she walks wide-eyed past the studios and satellite feeds.
In this context, Del Rey is oddly anonymous. Jane Hill, who is preparing to read the lunchtime news on BBC One, doesn't even look up when the superstar squeezes past her desk.
It's a rare luxury for someone who's followed by paparazzi and the all-seeing cameras of TMZ when she's at home in California.
She addresses the lack of privacy on her new album, Lust For Life, where a song called 13 Beaches finds Del Rey searching for a spot ""past Ventura and lenses plenty"" where she can enjoy a romantic moment in seclusion.
When we sit down to chat, she reveals those same concerns stopped her attending the women's marches in Los Angeles, earlier this year.
""I drove my sister and her girlfriends to the marches,"" she says. ""I thought about [joining in] but I felt, like, not really sure how it would go.
""I didn't really want to be a distraction to that group of 10 girls who were going. I wanted them to think about the actual march and not about me standing right next to them.""
But the star is making her contribution in other ways. A new song, God Bless America And All The Beautiful Women In It, is an ode to womankind (""may you stand proud and strong""); while Coachella - Woodstock In My Mind, mines the contradictions of dancing at a festival ""whilst watching tensions with North Korea mount"".
It's a new dimension for Del Rey's lyrics - which have traditionally concerned themselves with ""looking for love in all the wrong places"".
""I kind of got jolted into the real world again,"" she says.
""Just being in California, it's such a liberal state, I was bombarded with the news every day. So my studio became like a think tank - during the elections it was a constant conversation with my producer and engineers and assistant engineers.
""And then obviously during Coachella, that news broke about North Korea and pointing missiles at each other. That was a bit of a rude awakening.""
Del Rey's work rate is astonishing. Lust For Life is her fifth album in six years - and it bursts at the seams, with 16 tracks all co-written with her longtime producer Rick Nowels.
They record everything at his studio in Santa Monica, just blocks away from the beach, so it ""never feels like work,"" she says.
""Just walking in every day and having a coffee together and taking a walk, and then we start.
""So it doesn't ever feel like I'm pumping them [the songs] out. Although it's definitely a blessing that I've been able to put out so much music.""
On Lust For Life, the singer has opened up musically, as well as lyrically. The title track is a pulse-raising duet with The Weeknd, while Summer Bummer almost self-destructs, dissolving into digital noise and blacked-out beats, with Lana's vocals barely holding the song together.
She's also welcomed collaborators into her world for the first time - absorbing them into her aesthetic, rather than capitalising on chart trends.
""It was really fun!"" she says of working with A$AP Rocky and The Weeknd. ""I wanted those guys to add a little fire, a little energy to the record.""
More daunting was inviting rock legend Stevie Nicks to duet on Beautiful People, Beautiful Problems.
""I was definitely nervous,"" says Del Rey of the recording session.
""She got off the plane at 10:30, so she didn't get to the studio until midnight - and she just breezed in, black on black, gold everywhere. She was kind of a vision.
""When she started singing, she told me she wanted to hear me sing something, too. And then I really freaked out!
""I said to her over the mic, 'I just sound so quiet compared to you.' And she was like, 'That's ok, you can be my little echo!'
""I thought that was so cool. I'm not as loud as her. My voice isn't as low as hers. But she loves it for what it is.
""That, as it was happening, was a career-defining moment for me.""
Other songs on the album had a more troubled gestation. Del Rey says the closing track, Get Free, originally had a different title, and much more personal lyrics.
""That song started out really revealing,"" she says. ""I wanted to summarise my whole experience over the last six years; and then I realised, I don't want to reveal everything.""
Once the initial version was ""out of my system"", she says, the recording was ""deleted completely then started from scratch"".
The lyrics became more vague and more hopeful; and the re-recorded version ends with Del Rey referencing Neil Young: ""I want to move out of the black, into the blue"".
""I think it would have been hard for me to do interviews if I'd said a couple of particular things that I was thinking of,"" she says of the original.
""Kind of the way Ultraviolence did. It was harder to promote that record.""
She's referring to the title track of her second album, which depicted Del Rey in a destructive, abusive relationship. Del Rey has previously hinted the song refers to her association with an ""underground sect"" in New York, which was controlled by a charismatic guru.
In concert, she has recently stopped singing the song's key line, ""he hit me and it felt like a kiss"".
""I don't feel comfortable with that lyric any more,"" she says now. ""Whatever my concept of affection was at the time, it does not serve me any more. Obviously. Hopefully.""
On Lust For Life she seems happier, more outward-looking than before. On stage, she's more confident, too.
Launching the album at a one-off gig in London, she's forced to abandon her performance of the opening track, Love.
Earlier in her career, she might have frozen. Now, she just sings it a capella, with the crowd stepping in as her own personal choir.
""I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I think my keyboard player was playing the wrong chords,"" she explains. ""I was leaning in to him and saying, 'That's not it, that's not it' and he was like, 'That is it, trust me'.
""I listened for 10 seconds and I was like, 'Damn, I definitely can't get it'. I couldn't get it in rehearsal, either. So I just told him to stop. I feel bad - I was kind of abrasive.
""But that song is at the heart of the record and I thought it'd be weird if I didn't do it. So, luckily the people who were at the show knew the words and they sang along with me.""
She listens with glee to a recording of the song - explaining how, because she wears in-ear headphones, she hadn't realised how loud the crowd had been.
""I'm so glad,"" she says. ""Being in the audience, did you feel that, too?""
I tell her it was like being in church. ""Oh, stop!"" she beams, and bursts into laughter.
That good mood isn't going anywhere soon.

724,"Judge Carlos Castro Martins reversed the order he had issued in September, which had barred any work on the Belo Monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the Xingu river.
He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing.
The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists.
Judge Martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing.
He had barred the Norte Energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals.
Legal wrangling
Norte Energia appealed against the decision and Judge Martins ruled on Friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work.
""Since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,"" he said.
Judge Martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project ""could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen"".
He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil's Indian Affairs Department (Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama.
Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban.
If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay.

Schools in Wiltshire, Cumbria and Clackmannanshire introduced a ban on conkers over fears the horse chestnuts could trigger anaphylactic reactions.
The Anaphylaxis Campaign said a ""common sense approach"" would be better, where conkers are put in a safe place after battle and all involved give their hands a good wash.
Some schools took to allowing their children to take part in conker fights provided they were wearing protective goggles.
A Carlisle headteacher said it was a ""sensible"" step to shield children's eyes from pieces of flying horse chestnut.
In January, birthday cakes were banned at a Blackpool primary school as teachers ""do not have time"" to check ingredients for pupils with allergies.

726,"The exhibition, From Dark to Light, explores the work of artist Victor Noble Rainbird, who was born in North Shields in 1887.
The largest collection to have been staged since the 1930s, his favourite subjects were the North Sea and the streets and people of his hometown.
Curator Dave Young said there was a lot of affection for him in the town.
Many of the pieces on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre in North Shields have never been seen in public before.
Mr Young, said: ""We hope that this exhibition will shed new light on the life and work of a remarkable man and also a much misunderstood artist.
""This is the first major exhibition of his paintings to be held in his hometown of North Shields since the artist's lifetime and it is being held in a building that he would have known well and often painted.
""Victor Noble Rainbird's paintings are a fascinating legacy of life in the North East before and after the Great War, while his own remarkable war record is only now being unravelled.""
Mr Rainbird joined the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1914 when he was 26-years-old and served on the Western Front at Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and Armentieres.
Some of the drawings he produced while on active service have survived and are included in the exhibition.
Mr Young said they were a ""poignant, important and sombre record of the horrors of war"".

728,"The EAW is widely seen to have speeded up extradition proceedings in the EU, but there is also pressure to fix shortcomings in the system.
What is the EAW?
The EAW operates EU-wide and replaced separate extradition arrangements between the EU member states. The EAW was introduced in January 2004, and was prompted by the international anti-terror drive after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US.
A national judicial authority, such as a court, can issue an EAW to get a suspect extradited. For an EAW to be valid, the suspect must be accused of an offence incurring a maximum penalty of at least a year in prison, or must have been already sentenced to at least four months in prison.
The EAW means faster and simpler surrender procedures for suspects. EU states can no longer refuse to extradite one of their citizens on grounds of nationality. Extradition no longer requires a political decision for a suspect to be handed over. The EAW means mutual recognition of criminal justice systems in the EU.
How much faster are extradition proceedings now?
Before the EAW was introduced extradition used to take an average of one year, but now that has been cut to an average of 48 days, the European Commission says. A suspect must be handed over within a maximum of 90 days after arrest. In cases where a suspect agrees to surrender the average extradition time is 16 days.
How many EAWs are issued and how many suspects handed over?
Figures for 2009 show that 15,827 EAWs were issued in total and of those 4,431 were executed. The breakdown, given in a European Commission report, shows that Poland issued the most EAWs - 4,844. Of those, fewer than half were executed - 1,367. Germany was second for the number of EAWs issued - 2,433, then Romania with 1,900. The figures for the UK were: 220 issued, 80 executed.
What are the arguments for EAWs?
A senior British police officer, Commander Allan Gibson, says the EAW has brought a big increase in extradition and has reduced delays and costs. Cmdr Gibson, of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), says the EAW has been a great help in cross-border operations against organised crime, such as joint UK-Czech and UK-Romanian action against people traffickers. In the UK, regional police forces can now issue EAWs, whereas previously extradition cases were all handled in London.
There have been some high-profile successes for the EAW. Fugitive teacher Jeremy Forrest, who fled to France with a schoolgirl, was extradited to England on an EAW issued in September 2012.  In 2005 an EAW enabled the UK to quickly extradite from Italy a fugitive bomber, Hussain Osman, who with accomplices had attempted to carry out a terror attack in London.  In 2012 a murderer, Jason McKay, was arrested in Warsaw and sent back to the UK within a month.
What are the criticisms of EAWs?
There has been much debate about proportionality - that is, the need to use EAWs only for the most serious crimes. In a debate on EU justice and policing Cmdr Gibson and Jodie Blackstock of the human rights group Justice said Poland had sent too many EAW requests to the UK.
A report by the campaign group Fair Trials International in May 2011 said EAWs ""are being issued for minor offences and without proper consideration of whether extradition is proportionate"". That concern was echoed by the European Commission, which said the use of EAWs for minor offences had undermined confidence in the system.
Fair Trials International also complained that suspects were ""not being provided with legal representation in the issuing state as well as the executing state"". According to Ms Blackstock, more needs to be done to ensure effective legal defence for suspects in cross-border cases. Often the defence lawyers are young and inexperienced in such cases, she says.
Baroness Sarah Ludford, a Lib Dem MEP specialising in EU justice issues, says EU justice officials should exercise more peer pressure on each other to prevent abuses of the EAW. If somebody has been cleared of charges they should be removed from the EAW alert system, she argues.
In one high-profile miscarriage of justice Deborah Dark, a British woman, was pursued across Europe because of an EAW issued by France, although she had been cleared of drug charges years previously.
Can a country refuse to execute an EAW?
Yes. There is the double jeopardy principle - a suspect will not be returned to the country that issued the EAW if he or she has already been tried for the same offence abroad. A refusal can be justified if an EU state's amnesty covers the offence in question. A refusal can also be justified under a statute of limitations - that is, if a time limit has passed for prosecution. And a state can reject an EAW if under its laws the suspect is a minor, below the age of criminal responsibility.
An EAW can also be rejected if legal authorities consider that extradition would violate the suspect's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Concern that an EAW was motivated by prejudice on grounds of race, religion, politics or another factor can also be grounds to block extradition, under European law. The EAW is not supposed to be a tool for collusion in discrimination.","The UK government wants to claw back some EU powers over justice and policing, but is likely to remain in the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system.",23239493,"The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) has been implemented in the EU to speed up extradition proceedings, but it has also faced criticism for its potential misuse, such as being issued for minor offenses or without proper consideration of proportionality, and there are arguments for and against its use, including concerns about the double jeopardy principle and the potential for discrimination.",0,"Article: {}

""This is a must-win for me - I'm confident I can upset the champion,"" said Cleverly. ""I believe this is my opportunity to turn things around.""
Cleverly and Braehmer were due to meet in 2011 before an eye injury forced Braehmer to withdraw.
The German will be aiming for a seventh successful defence of his title, while Cleverly lost his WBO crown in 2013 when he was stopped by Sergey Kovalev.
Asked if this would be his last world title fight if he lost to Braehmer, Cleverly told BBC Radio Wales Sport: ""Possibly so and probably so.

731,"He spoke after a crisis meeting in Brussels about the global steel glut that was attended by 30 countries.
China has ""absolutely recognised that it is a problem of overcapacity in their country"", Mr Javid said.
However, China rejected suggestions that it subsidised its loss-making steel companies, and the meeting ended without any formal agreement.
Nevertheless, Mr Javid said China is ""committing to do something about it and I think that's a very positive step forward"".
He said it was the first time all the major steel-producing nations had come together with the industry to discuss the issue of excess capacity.
Mr Javid admitted that there was no ""overnight solution"" to the issue of excess production: ""The discussion today with all these countries coming together is something that we pushed for, and ... China's participation will help make the difference.""
Chinese steel output rose in March, according to official figures released last week, despite repeated pledges to cut capacity.
Ministers and trade officials, including from the US and India, as well as the World Trade Organisation, World Steel Association and the private sector attended Monday's meeting, which was organised by the OECD.
Mari Kiviniemi, OECD deputy secretary-general, said there was ""very strong willingness"" to hold further talks, with some countries wanting to take more ""concrete steps"".
Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: ""We appear to be no closer to finding international action to put in place solutions. This is a global problem which requires a global solution to remove current over-capacity and time is a luxury we don't have.""
He called on China to take the same radical action that European steel producers had embraced.
Earlier, China's official news agency said that blaming the country for the global steel industry's problems was a ""lame and lazy excuse for protectionism"".
Xinhua said in an English-language commentary piece: ""Blaming other countries is always an easy, sure-fire way for politicians to whip up a storm over domestic economic woes, but finger-pointing and protectionism are counter-productive. The last thing the world needs is a trade war over this issue. Far more jobs will be lost than gained if protectionism prevails.""
EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem told the meeting the steel crisis was ""now life or death for many companies"", but that tariffs were ""only a short-term bandage"", adding: ""Healing the sector's wounds requires sustained international cooperation leading to effective reform.""
The internal market and industry commissioner, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said the European Union should consider allowing member nations to subsidise their steel industries.
""We have to discuss whether we can't be more flexible in our judgment of state aid,"" she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""We cannot push this industry any further.""

The steel crisis has put thousands of UK jobs under threat at plants including Port Talbot in south Wales.
Tata Steel said last month that it was selling its unprofitable UK plants. The company has blamed factors including high energy costs and China ""dumping"" steel on the global market.
Britain's steel industry: What's going wrong?
Roy Rickhuss, leader of the Community union, said the meeting was more concerned with the long term, rather than immediate action to save the UK industry.
""Today's meeting seemed to be all about long-term challenges. While these issues do need addressing, what we need is urgent short-term action from governments across Europe and beyond to get us through the current crisis and create a sustainable future for steel.""
The Government has come under pressure to rescue Port Talbot and has been urged to consider part-nationalising the industry.
Mr Javid said parties interested in Tata's UK assets had started to come forward: ""It's too early to say much about them at this stage but the important thing is, as we said all along, we will do everything we can to help with that sales process. The steel workers of Britain deserve nothing less.""
The business secretary said that EY had been appointed to act as financial advisers on behalf of the Government, which was ""committed to doing all it can to ensure a sustainable future for the UK steel industry"".
Tata has also appointed Standard Chartered bank as an additional adviser.
The Indian group said on Monday that Bimlendra Jha has been appointed to the new role of chief executive of Tata Steel UK.
He is executive chairman of the company's Long Products business in Europe and oversaw the sale of plants in Scunthorpe and Teesside to Greybull Capital earlier this month.","China has vowed to reduce the amount of steel it makes, Business Secretary Sajid Javid said.",36073140,"The article discusses the global steel glut and the meeting of 30 countries in Brussels to address the issue, with China acknowledging the problem of overcapacity but rejecting suggestions of subsidies, and the UK government committing to help rescue the British steel industry but providing no immediate solutions.",0,"Article: {}

That was extended early in the second period when Miles Storey's effort found the net via the post before Josh Meekings side-footed a third.
Kris Doolan's consolation gave home fans something to clap but Jordan Roberts notched a fourth for Caley.
It was an unusually abject performance from the Glasgow Jags, who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left.

The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for Caley Thistle boss John Hughes, who has eyes for a few out-of-contract Partick players.
One of them is Steven Lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by Ryan Edwards.
Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at Firhill since 16 January, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in Maryhill.
Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo released Tremarco.
At first it seemed the Englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot.
Sean Welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving Owain Fon Williams in the Inverness goalmouth soon after.
Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Caley Thistle immediately extended their lead when Meekings found Storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan Swindon Town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle.
The Firhill crowd got even more uneasy when Roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by Mbuyi-Mutombo, then Partick goalkeeper Ryan Scully had to pull off a great stop to deny Storey getting his second of the afternoon.
When Roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos.
Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from Greg Tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for Inverness.
Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding Fon Williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead.

734,"Delivering his judgement, a judge said it was for the Stormont Assembly, and not a judge, to decide social policy.
A joint case was taken by the first lesbian couple and the first gay couple to enter civil partnerships in the UK.
The second case was brought by a couple who wed in England but want their marriage legally recognised at home in Northern Ireland.
The judge heard the cases together due to the similarities of the legal arguments.
Mr Justice O'Hara said: ""It is not at all difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage.
""However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law.""
Same-sex marriage is legal in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland, but is banned in Northern Ireland.
Shannon Sickles, Grainne Close, and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane were challenging Stormont's refusal to legislate for same-sex marriage.
Ms Close said she was ""devastated"" by the ruling.
""For us, this is a personal matter,"" she said.
""We have families and our children are being treated differently because of today's result.""
Her partner, Ms Sickles, said they would continue their legal challenge.
Twelve years ago, Northern Ireland was the first place in the UK to introduce civil partnerships.
Ms Sickles and Ms Close made history on 19 December 2005 when their relationship was legally recognised in the UK's first civil partnership ceremony at Belfast City Hall.
They were closely followed by Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane, whose civil partnership took place later that same day.
During the joint challenge to the law in Northern Ireland, the couple's lawyers argued that the ban breaches Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, by denying respect for their private and family lives.
But a lawyer for Stormont's Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) countered that the ban was not a breach of human rights and that civil partnerships already met the minimum requirements set out under human rights law.
The couple who married in England had been granted anonymity, and their case was referred to as Petition X.
The campaign for same-sex marriage has been highly divisive at the Northern Ireland Assembly in recent years, and is currently one of the main sticking points in Stormont's continuing political crisis.
Assembly members (MLAs) have voted five times on whether or not to introduce same-sex marriage.
During the fifth vote in November 2015, MLAs voted in favour of legalisation for the first time, with the slimmest majority of 53 votes to 52.
However, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) used a Stormont veto, known as a petition of concern, to block the motion and prevent any change in the law.
Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said it was ""shameful"" the couples had been forced to take their cases to court.
""Last May both Sinn Féin and the DUP refused the Alliance Party's proposal to reform the petition of concern - the crucial reform that would make equal marriage a reality,"" she said.
""Now the challenge has been thrown firmly back at the politicians and it is essential we get Stormont up and running again to stabilise Northern Ireland and start delivering for everyone.""
The marriage of the couple in the Petition X case was treated as a civil partnership in Northern Ireland, under the terms of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013,
The devolved distinction was made possible after negotiations between a previous Westminster government and a previous Northern Ireland Assembly.
The couple took their vows ""because they believe in the traditional values associated with marriage,"" according to their solicitor.
""We sighed when the ruling was read out not through disappointment, but simply because the inevitable recognition of same-sex marriage has been further delayed in Northern Ireland,"" they said.
""The work will continue, the wind is to our back.""
SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said The LGBT community was ""not a punching bag to be hit again and again"".
""Ours is now the only small corner of these islands where we maintain a hierarchy of love,"" he said.
""We are increasingly isolated here and across Europe as a place where the commitment and compassion of a same-sex couple is not recognised or reflected in our law.""
Sinn Féin MLA Carál Ní Chuilín said the issue was at the heart of the current political crisis in Northern Ireland - where the Assembly has been in limbo since power-sharing broke down in January.

They brought the test case to the High Court, claiming the delay was unlawful.
A minister said ""significant progress"" had been made in processing claims.
PIPs started replacing disability allowance in April 2013.
Labour, along with several charities, criticised the government for the way it handled the switchover, which left about 3,000 people waiting more than a year to have their welfare claims processed.
The High Court is now conducting a judicial review into the payment system.
The claimants said they struggled to pay for food and fuel because of the delays and their health declined as a result.

""We worked extremely hard in our first year to achieve something amazing, which I am very proud of. Now we must work even harder to stay at the top.""
The decision to sign a new contract without extending the terms runs counter to previous comments by Conte, who had indicated his willingness to commit to a longer deal.
Speaking in May, he said he wanted to stay with Chelsea ""for many years"", adding: ""If the club give me the possibility to stay and extend my contract, for sure I'm available to.""
Conte lifted the Premier League title at the first attempt in the 2016-17 season, winning 30 games, which included a club record 13 consecutive victories. He also guided the Blues to the FA Cup final, though they were beaten by Arsenal.
The former Juventus and Italy manager was credited for transforming the Stamford Bridge club's fortunes after they could only finish 10th the previous season.
A brutal training regime was part of the transformation, as was his decision to switch to a three-man central-defensive set-up - his preferred tactic at both Juve and Italy.

The bank, thought to be the first of its kind, has invested about £2bn of public money in about 50 projects.
But critics called the sale ""reckless"" and questioned the government's commitment to a low-carbon economy.
It is unclear how much of the GIB the government might sell, although the Financial Times has reported that it could be about 70%, with a sale price of well above £1bn.
The move is part of the government's plan to sell off assets to pay down the deficit, and comes after the disposal of stakes in Royal Mail and Lloyds Banking Group.
The Edinburgh-based GIB was launched in 2012, pledging loans to ""green"" projects that have also attracted private sector money. It has invested in wind power, bio-energy, and renewal projects.
The bank said it became profitable in the 2014-15 financial year, making a £100,000 pre-tax profit.
But there are restrictions on its borrowing, and Mr Javid hopes that full access to the capital markets will increase its lending powers.
Speaking at the GIB's annual review event in London on Thursday, Mr Javid said: ""The bank will be able to access a much greater volume of capital and deploy it across a much wider array of green projects.""
He added that the privatisation would mean ""more money going into green innovations"" and more support for ""environmental entrepreneurs"".
Mr Javid said the GIB had debunked the idea that green investment was incapable of making a profit.
""Its rigorous, commercial approach to investment has helped attract sovereign wealth funds, pension schemes and private equity investors to the sector for the very first time,"" he said.
Chancellor George Osborne said in an earlier statement: ""We want the Green Investment Bank to attract more investment and we will use the money we raise to pay down the national debt and deliver lasting economic security for working people.""
Mr Javid's department has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to advise on the financial details and timetable for the sale.
Critics argue that a sale would dilute the bank's purpose and undermine the UK's commitment to the green economy.
Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, called the sell-off plan ""rash and irresponsible"" and said any such move called into question the UK's commitment to investing in a low-carbon economy.
""The government should keep at least a majority stake in the Green Investment Bank to ensure investor confidence is upheld and the commitment to low-carbon lending remains,"" she said.
Think-tank E3G, which advised on the original plans to established a green bank, said a sell-off would be ""reckless"" and damage investor confidence.
Chief executive Nick Mabey said: ""The Green Investment Bank is not just the government's most lauded innovation in the war against climate change.

The Queen's unguarded comments are atypical for her, but also pose some unanswered questions about the visit.
In short, we don't know. Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi was ""seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese"", according to the Lord Chamberlain, who introduced her to the Queen.
Commander D'Orsi said it ""was quite a testing time"" and that ""they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off"".
The Queen clearly knew all about the incident concerned and interjected: ""They were very rude to the ambassador.""
""They walked out on both of us,"" replied Ms D'Orsi.
Did Ms D'Orsi mean that Chinese officials threatened to cancel the whole state visit? Or just part of the itinerary?
Was any conflict to do with security arrangements (as Ms D'Orsi was clearly under pressure) or of wider diplomatic significance?
We simply do not know. The police have not issued any statement.
President Xi and his wife Madame Peng were guests of the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace for the state visit so perhaps it is to be expected that the Queen would be aware of such details.
The Metropolitan Police had to defend itself from human rights groups' accusations that it dealt inappropriately with protesters during Mr Xi's visit in October 2015.
Commander D'Orsi issued a statement in the immediate aftermath of the visit saying she was disappointed at hearing the view expressed that the Met was ""working to the bidding of the Chinese to suppress protest"".
The Queen's comments were picked up by the microphone of the camera filming the garden party event, operated by Peter Wilkinson, the monarch's official cameraman
His footage was released to broadcasters under the ""pool"" arrangement which is standard procedure for royal events (to avoid all broadcasters sending their own crews to every engagement).
It was only then that the uncharacteristically undiplomatic comments were spotted.
Indeed. At the time Mr Xi said he believed his visit would lift UK-China relations to a ""new height"".
Buckingham Palace would not comment on a ""private conversation"" but said all parties worked closely to ensure the visit proceeded smoothly.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said the president's trip to the UK was very successful and ""marked the start of the Golden Era between China and the UK"".
We now know, thanks to the Queen's comments, that it was a testing time behind the scenes, at least for the police commander and the British ambassador to China. However, that does not mean that overall the trip was not a success.
Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, and a former senior British diplomat in Beijing, told the BBC that it was striking that even someone with the Queen's six decades of diplomatic experience still found dealing with the Chinese protocols and machinery tough:
""In terms of the atmospherics between diplomats in China and the UK, it's not an easy relationship and that comes through in the freight of emotion that was in her comments.""
At the moment, there is no coverage whatsoever of this in mainland China, says BBC Monitoring's China Media Analyst Kerry Allen.
""This is not unusual. The comments the Queen made will be regarded as highly embarrassing by China's elite, as the concept of 'maintaining face' - one's sense of dignity or prestige - is incredibly important within the country,"" she says.
""Owing to the sensitivity of her comments, state media will be required to hold off covering this until the government decides what official response to give.
""Some users of popular microblogs like Sina Weibo though are commenting on it and quickly gaining responses. However, the censors are catching up and censoring comments to limit impact.""

741,"They will be able to end tenancies, sometimes without a court order, when asylum requests fail, ministers say.
Landlords will also be required to check a migrant's status in advance of agreeing a lease. Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison.
But critics have said it may lead to UK citizens being refused accommodation.
The proposals - to be included in the upcoming Immigration Bill - come as the British and French governments struggle to deal with a migrant crisis in Calais, where large numbers of people are making nightly bids to cross the Channel to reach the UK.
Under the proposals for landlords in England, the Home Office would issue a notice when an asylum application fails that confirms the tenant no longer has the right to rent property.
Analysis by legal correspondent Clive Coleman
It is currently a criminal offence to remove tenants without a court order. Obtaining that order enables bailiffs to evict tenants. That all takes time. The new measure may cut out court orders, but it is unclear:
This will trigger a power for landlords to end the tenancy, without a court order in some circumstances.
Landlords will also be required to carry out ""right to rent"" checks on each tenant's immigration status before allowing them to move in, expanding a pilot that has been running for a year in the west Midlands.
Repeatedly failing to do either would be a new offence carrying maximum penalties of five years' imprisonment or a fine.
A blacklist of ""rogue"" landlords and letting agents will allow councils to keep track of those who have been convicted of housing offences and ban them from renting out properties if they are repeat offenders.
Communities Secretary Greg Clark acknowledged that cases in which tenants refused to move out would still end up in court but that the process would be quicker because landlords would have official ""evidence"" to present to the courts of their tenant's status.
""You have saved the landlord having to spend money establishing something that is clear and that the Home Office can provide - which is a clear statement of whether they should be there or not,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Asked whether evicting migrants simply increased the risk of people disappearing altogether, unless immediately detained by the police, Mr Clark said the initiative was part of a ""joined-up system to send people home"".
Analysis, by Alicia McCarthy
The streets of the UK are not paved with gold. That's the clear message the government wants to send to those tempted to come to Britain illegally.
Ministers say the tightening of the demands on private landlords in England is simply the enactment of a manifesto promise to make them carry out the same checks as employers and that migrants need to know there is no right to work or rent a home if you are in the UK illegally.
It's not clear yet how the scheme will work or what impact it will have other than moving illegal immigrants from where they are living.
And some may suspect the timing of the announcement is a response to the nightly television news pictures showing scores of desperate migrants trying to cross the channel - and to criticism from some that ministers have failed to get a grip on the situation swiftly enough.
For Labour, shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he backed tougher checks but said ministers appeared to be ""offloading"" the problem on to landlords and it was up to the authorities to decide whether people should be allowed to remain or deported.
Since August 2014, private landlords in five councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham - have been required to conduct checks to establish new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face face a penalty of up to £3,000.
Mr Clark said the pilot - introduced as part of the 2014 Immigration Act - had been a success and would be extended across more of the UK, although he could not say how many people had been deported as a direct result.
But the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the pilot - which has yet to be officially evaluated - had serious shortcomings.
""We have heard that British people with foreign accents are finding it difficult to get tenancies from some of the, you might say, unscrupulous landlords,"" its chief executive Habib Rahman told Radio 4's World at One.
And David Smith, from the Residential Landlords Association, said there was evidence of ""document discrimination"" with some landlords reluctant to rent their properties to anyone who could not produce a valid passport.",Landlords in England will be expected to evict tenants who lose the right to live in the UK  under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration.,33754595,"The UK government plans to give immigration enforcement powers to private landlords in England, allowing them to end tenancies of failed asylum seekers without a court order, while also requiring them to conduct ""right to rent"" checks and face penalties for non-compliance, with the aim of removing undocumented migrants from the country.",0,"Article: {}

With a reported production budget of Â£17m, Guardians of the Galaxy forms part of Marvel's so-called ""Phase 2"" project.
The first phase involved the development and release of superhero movies featuring well-known comic book characters such as Iron Man, Captain America and Thor.
Guardians' cast includes Chris Pratt, who provided the voice for Emmet Brickowoski in box office hit The Lego Movie, and Zoe Saldana, who starred in Avatar and the two recent Star Trek movies.
Directed by James Gunn, Guardians of the Galaxy draws on characters and stories that first appeared in Marvel comics in 1969.
Gillan's character Nebula first appeared in the comics in 1985.
Last July, Gillan unveiled part of her look for the film at Comic-Con International in San Diego, one of the world's biggest celebrations of comic books and movies based on them.
During a press conference with other cast members, she removed a wig to reveal a shaven head.
At the UK premiere for Guardians of the Galaxy earlier this week, Gillan told the BBC how designers working on the new Star Wars film made the wig she wore at Comic-Con.
Gillan's character, Nebula, has been described in the Marvel comics as a ruthless space pirate and former leader of a band of mercenaries.
There are glimpses of Gillan in trailers being seen in cinemas and online ahead of the movie's release.

It already has plans, revealed in January, to increase footfall to 18 million passengers a year.
The new proposal has been criticised by Hertfordshire County Council. LLAL said the new proposals were just one option.
The proposals were revealed by the council after the figure was mentioned in discussions between the owner and the Planning Inspectorate.
The new application is set to be submitted in 2013.
Robert Gordon, leader of the county council, said: ""I am stunned by this news.
""Local authorities and communities alike are worried at the speed with which even the current proposals to expand capacity up to 18 million people per annum are being progressed, but have engaged in the consultations and await any planning application in good faith.
""Make no mistake, this is a huge expansion proposal and represents a throughput not significantly different from that currently experienced at London Gatwick and 10 million people per annum more than currently experienced at London Stansted.""

744,"The clause backing ""common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange"", was scrapped under Tony Blair in 1995.
Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour ""shouldn't shy away"" from public control of railways and public investment in industry.
Leadership rival Liz Kendall told the paper Clause IV belonged in the past.
Tony Blair's move two decades ago to ditch the long-standing commitment in Labour's constitution to public ownership was seen by some as a symbolic step which made the party more electable in the post-Margaret Thatcher era.
The original wording of Clause IV was replaced with a new commitment to ""a thriving private sector and high-quality public services where those undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public or accountable to them"".
Mr Corbyn told the IoS he could consider bringing back the old Clause IV as part of a commitment to take ""necessary things"" back into public ownership.
""I think we should talk about what the objectives of the party are, whether that's restoring the Clause IV as it was originally written or it's a different one, but I think we shouldn't shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways,"" he said.
""I'm interested in the idea that we have a more inclusive, clearer set of objectives. I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail.""
Mr Corbyn's campaign momentum seems unflagging  - to the alarm of senior figures in the party. But he says the party needs a new statement of objectives - and that could be the original Clause IV.
Jeremy Corbyn has already promised to renationalise energy companies and the railways and increase public spending on industry. One of Mr Corbyn's leadership rivals, Liz Kendall, condemned the idea as a ""throwback to the past"".
Some party donors are alarmed by the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn win too. Businessman Assem Allam, who donated Â£300,000 to Labour during the election, has told the Sunday Telegraph he would stop giving money to the party if Mr Corbyn becomes leader, saying he never backed a ""dead horse"".
Mr Corbyn is one of four candidates standing in next month's Labour leader election, alongside Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham.
Ms Kendall - the leadership challenger seen as being the closest to Mr Blair's policies - fiercely condemned the idea of bringing back Clause IV.
""This shows there is nothing new about Jeremy Corbyn's politics,"" she said.
""Life had moved on from the old Clause IV in 1994, let alone 2015. We are a party of the future, not a preservation society.""

745,"His comments come on a day marking the first anniversary of a project to protect all of the nation's mangroves.
As well as storing carbon, the forests provide habitat for fish and protect communities from tsunamis and cyclones.
Also on Tuesday - World Mangrove Day - Sri Lanka's president will open the world's first mangrove museum.
The museum will act as a hub for conservation training for adults, and educating children about the value of mangroves. It is estimated that 20,000 pupils will visit the museum in the first year.
Read also: The community who won back their mangroves
The Sri Lankan government has also included mangrove forest conservation into its national curriculum.
The museum is a central pillar of a five-year programme to protect all of the island nation's mangroves.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said: ""Mangroves swiftly absorb carbon dioxide and inject oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining an ecological balance vital for the environment.
""It is my belief that the mangrove restoration project will generate much needed awareness among key stakeholders such as the community, leisure sector personnel, tourists, and the general public.""
He added: ""It is my hope that this will be the beginning of a long-term effort to sustain the mangroves for greater conservation benefit.""
In partnership with island conservation organisation Seacology and local NGO Sudeesa, the Sri Lankan government has identified all of the nation's 15,000 hectares of mangrove forests, and has surveyed almost half of them.
Ministers have also introduced legislation to protect the habitats and have assigned forest officers to help guard them.
Seacology executive director Duane Silverstein explained that although the project required US $3.4 million of funding, the sum was dwarfed when the ecosystem services provided by Sri Lanka's mangrove forests were taken into account.
""In last year, research has been published looking at the economic value of mangrove in Asia,"" he said.
""It has concluded that each hectare has a value of US $194,000 - that would put an economic value of our project at US $2.9 billion.""
He told BBC News that mangroves were critical in a number of areas, socially as well as environmentally.
""Firstly, they provide nurseries for young fish, which are protected among the mangrove roots,"" he explained.
""Secondly, and increasingly important, they provide protection from natural disasters such as tsunamis and cyclones. They disperse the energy in the sea and waves, therefore the villages that have intact mangroves suffer significantly less damage.
""Thirdly, and most importantly, mangrove forests sequester far much more carbon than other times of forest. A recent UN report estimated that mangroves store about 1,000 tonnes per hectare in their biomass and underlying soil. There is a minimum of 15,000 hectares of mangrove in Sri Lanka, meaning that the country's mangroves are sequestering 15 million tonnes of carbon.""
One of the threats facing mangrove forests around the world is the emergence of shrimp farms in order to meet the growing global demand for shrimps/prawns.
In order to build saltwater ponds needed to rear the crustaceans, mangroves - which grown in the intertidal area of shorelines - are felled, either legally or illegally.
This practice has been identified by the United Nations as one of the main drivers for the loss of the valuable and most at-risk habitat, with more than half of mangroves being lost or felled over the past century.
However, the development of shrimp farms in Sri Lanka had resulted in a significant fall in fish catch yields, say local conservationists.
This resulted in local fishing communities losing incomes and livelihoods, making them aware of the importance and value of healthy mangrove forests, and keen to protect them.
Mr Silverstein said that the conservation model adopted in Sri Lanka could be rolled out to other mangrove-rich nations, however he added that ""one size would not fit all"".
""However, it is very clear that we are demonstrating that a nation can preserve all of its mangroves, and still improve the economic quality of people's lives.
""Although the Sri Lanka project has four more years to run, it does take many years of planning. We are looking at working with another nation to do something similar.""

746,"During a visit to Birmingham on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn is expected to say a 17% increase in Carer's Allowance would help around one million people in the first year of a Labour government.
Under the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from £62.70 to £73.10 a week.
Ministers say they will spend an extra £2bn on social care over three years.
Carer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week.
Eligible carers cannot earn more than £116 a week after tax.
Mr Corbyn said he believed it ""would be a good thing to do"" to help carers, ""usually women"" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home.
""Caring for people is stressful,"" he told the BBC. ""In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.""
In his speech later, the Labour leader will claim ""Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting £4.6bn from council care budgets"".
""Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,"" he will say.
""The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers £132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support.
""That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of £10 a week.
""We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain.
""This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.""
According to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost £538m by 2020/21. This would be covered by scrapping the expected £650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth £1m free of death duties.
But the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance.
Luke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: ""Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do.
""That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional £450 a year for carers since 2010.
""Labour have already committed the money from corporation tax cuts 11 times over, so there is no way they could find the additional money for this promise.
""It's not worth the paper it's written on - just like Labour's reputation for economic management.""

747,"The experimental aircraft, which has a wingspan bigger than a jumbo but weighs little more than a large car, left Nanjing at 02:39 (18:39 GMT).
It is likely to take Mr Borschberg five to six days of continuous flight to reach his central Pacific destination.
He will try to stay awake for much of that time, taking only short catnaps.
His progress will be monitored the entire way from a control room in Monaco.
Meteorologists and flight strategists will constantly update him on the best route to follow.
The journey is the seventh leg in the single-seat, propeller-driven aircraft's quest to circumnavigate the globe using just the energy of the Sun.
The project made steady progress after starting out from Abu Dhabi in March, but was held up for more than a month on China's east coast waiting for the right weather conditions over the ocean.
Solar Impulse needs not only favourable winds to help push it forward, but also clear skies to enable its 17,000 wing-mounted photovoltaic cells to achieve peak performance.
These cells must have the vehicle's lithium-ion batteries fully topped up at dusk to sustain flying through to dawn the next day.
Mr Borschberg is a highly experienced pilot, and as a trained engineer is completely familiar with the plane's systems.
Nonetheless, he is in no doubt how tough the mission will be.
""It's more in the end about myself; it's going to be an inner-voyage,"" he told the BBC before departure.
""It's going to be a discovery about how I feel and how I sustain myself during these five or six days in the air.""
And Bertrand Piccard - who has flown Solar Impulse on other stages of the voyage - told the BBC: ""There's one pilot at a time, so the pilot needs to do everything on his own. And it's a very large aeroplane, big wingspans, sensitive to turbulence, flying quite slow.
""So sometimes it's difficult to handle when the air moves. But we have an auto-pilot, we have toilets on board, we have food for days, water reserves and everything, and we are well trained.""
The distance to Kalaeloa airport on Hawaii's O'ahu island is more than 8,000km (5,000 miles).
If, early on in the flight, the weather turns bad or he encounters a major technical problem, Mr Borschberg can always choose to turn around and head back to China or Japan.
But there will come a point where that option is denied to him, and Mr Borschberg and his support team have had to prepare for the possibility of ditching in the Pacific if something goes seriously wrong.
The pilot himself would not go down with the plane because of the risk of electrocution once in the water. Instead, he would bail out with a dinghy and wait for a ship to come and pick him up.
If he succeeds in reaching Kalaeloa airport, he will set several aviation records - not least the longest-duration journey for a single-seater plane.
The purpose of the Solar Impulse project is not really to showcase a particular kind of future for aviation, but rather to demonstrate the potential of clean technologies more generally.
