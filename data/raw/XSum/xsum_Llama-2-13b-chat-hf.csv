0,0,"Mother Josephine's parents fled to Taiwan from China with the retreating Nationalist party after it lost the civil war to the Communists in the late 1940s. They believed the Republic of China and mainland China were part of the same country and that is what she was taught.
Father Clyde worked for years at Taiwan's agency promoting trade, including with China. He and Mrs Wang believe Taiwan must have good relations with its biggest trade partner and former enemy, which wants Taiwan to be reunified one day. They don't support unification or independence, but maintaining the status quo.
But son Kevin, 30, strongly feels Taiwan is a separate country and must assert its independence or risk being swallowed up by China.
""My parents still think we are Chinese. In university I began doubting what I had been taught was correct,"" Kevin said. ""Now I believe Taiwan should be independent in all ways possible.
""The current government of the Republic of China in Taiwan is still inextricably tied to the concept that we are a part of China, so we need to cut the umbilical cord.""
People like Kevin have joined the so-called Sunflower Movement, which last year occupied parliament for 24 days sparking the largest anti-China demonstration in years.
They blocked the legislative approval of a controversial trade deal with China and forced the government to agree to a new law allowing more public oversight of negotiations with Beijing.
Though activities on the one-year anniversary in March were relatively small, and parliament is once again occupied by legislators, it's far from business as usual.
The movement has made many people feel that they, not just the government or ruling Kuomintang (KMT) party, should have a say in what kind of relationship Taiwan develops with China.
It has also contributed to a major defeat for the pro-China ruling party in November local elections. If it further fuels fears about China and dissatisfaction with the KMT, it could help the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) win next year's presidential race.
At the same time, it is pushing for reforms to Taiwan's referendum law to make it easier for referenda to pass.
Sunflower leaders say this will advance Taiwan's democratisation and safeguard its sovereignty by allowing the people to directly decide issues, including Taiwan's separate identity and relationship with China.
""If recognition of Taiwan's identity can be protected, then that will further Taiwan's self-rule. This is very important to us,"" said Sunflower leader Lin Fei-fan.
But not everyone supports the movement.
Though many deals have been signed with China in recent years, including some widely considered beneficial to Taiwan, would-be agreements are now on hold indefinitely.
This is causing concern from not only businesses such as banks that need greater access to China's market, but others who also believe it's crucial for the small island of Taiwan to have stronger ties with China, especially economic ones.
That includes Jen-Hsuan Hsieh, a recent university graduate. ""The whole world is trying to understand China. We should do the same,"" she said.
""Even if you consider it your enemy, you should still understand your enemy well.""
A freelance interpreter, she is looking for work in China, where the opportunities are greater and wages higher.
She's not alone. A recent survey showed about one third of Taiwanese in their 20s and 30s want to work in China; more than in previous years.
That raises the question of whether time is on China's side or Taiwan's.
With time, Taiwan's economy and people's livelihoods may become more interlinked with China, making it easier for Beijing to push for unification.
But with time, Taiwanese people could grow even more adamant about the island's separate entity. A survey conducted late last year by the local China Youth Corps found nearly 90% of junior and senior-high school students regarded themselves as Taiwanese, rather than Chinese.
Some suggest that if China becomes democratic, and its average living standard reaches Taiwan's level, differences between the two sides will be blurred, and if its people understand more about Taiwan with time, their views about unification may weaken, making such a debate unnecessary.
For now, Beijing is watching the Sunflower Movement closely. However, it may be unsure how to react, partly because it's no longer about dealing with one political party versus another, but many civic groups and individuals driving the movement.
So far, it has mainly suggested reaching out to Taiwan's young people.
Back at the Wang home, the family avoid discussing the issue of Taiwan's sovereignty or Kevin's part in the movement until they are asked. But it's clear he wants to become more involved.
""Maintaining the status quo will inevitably mean reunification with China. What a lot of people in our generation are pushing for right now is de jure independence, formal independence,"" he said.
His parents accept that his generation will ultimately decide their society's future; they just hope it makes the right decisions.
""We don't know what's going to happen in a couple more generations,"" said his father, Clyde. ""I don't think it's a good idea to antagonise China and to provoke war across the strait.""
""What I like to see happen in the future is eventually this historical problem will be solved in a very peaceful way.""",Breakfast at the Wangs' on a Sunday: it's a lesson in how attitudes in Taiwan towards China have changed significantly in just three generations.,32157210,"The Sunflower Movement in Taiwan, a pro-democracy and pro-independence movement, is pushing for reforms to Taiwan's referendum law and seeking to assert Taiwan's independence from China, while the ruling Kuomintang party and some Taiwanese people support maintaining the status quo and good relations with China, creating a complex and delicate situation.",0,"Article: {}

2,2,"That's the verdict of scientists who have analysed ancient DNA of the extinct animals for mutations.
The studies suggest the last mammoths died out after their DNA became riddled with errors.
The knowledge could inform conservation efforts for living animals.
There are fewer than 100 Asiatic cheetahs left in the wild, while the remaining mountain gorilla population is estimated at about 300. The numbers are similar to those of the last woolly mammoths living on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean around 4,000 years ago.
Dr Rebekah Rogers of the University of California, Berkeley, who led the research, said the mammoths' genomes ""were falling apart right before they went extinct"".
This, she said, was the first case of ""genomic meltdown"" in a single species.
""You had this last refuge of mammoths after everything has gone extinct on the mainland,"" she added.
""The mathematical theories that have been developed said that they should accumulate bad mutations because natural selection should become very inefficient.""
The researchers analysed genetic mutations found in the ancient DNA of a mammoth from 4,000 years ago. They used the DNA of a mammoth that lived about 45,000 years ago, when populations were much larger,  as a comparison.
Woolly mammoths were once common in North America and Siberia. They were driven to extinction by environmental factors and possibly human hunting about 10,000 years ago. Small island populations clung on until about 4,000 years ago.
""There was this huge excess of what looked like bad mutations in the genome of the mammoth from this island,"" said Dr Rogers.
""We found these bad mutations were accumulating in the mammoth genome right before they went extinct.""
Knowledge of the last days of the mammoth could help modern species on the brink of extinction, such as the panda, mountain gorilla and Indian elephant. The lesson from the woolly mammoth is that once numbers drop below a certain level, the population's genetic health may be beyond saving. Genetic testing could be one way to assess whether levels of genetic diversity in a species are enough to give it a chance of survival. A better option is to stop numbers falling too low.
""When you have these small populations for an extended period of time they can go into genomic meltdown, just like what we saw in the mammoth,"" said Dr Rogers.
""So if you can prevent these organisms ever being threatened or endangered then that will do a lot more to help prevent this type of genomic meltdown compared to if you have a small population and then bring it back up to larger numbers because it will still bear those signatures of this genomic meltdown.""
Scientists think the genetic mutations may have given the last woolly mammoths ""silky, shiny satin fur"". Mutations may have also led to a loss of olfactory receptors, responsible for the sense of smell, as well as substances in urine involved in social status and attracting a mate.
Love Dalen is professor of evolutionary genetics at the Swedish Museum of Natural History and head of the team of scientists that originally published the DNA sequences of the mammoths.
He said they found ""many deletions, big chunks of the genome that are missing, some of which even affected functional genes"".
""This is a very novel result,"" he said. ""If this holds up when more mammoth genomes, as well as genomes from other species, are analysed, it will have very important implications for conservation biology.""
The research is published in the journal, PLOS Genetics.

UK officials said the bill for policing the embassy, which stands at £12m ($18.8m; €16.8m), was ""unacceptable"".
Earlier, Swedish prosecutors dropped two sex assault claims against Mr Assange, who had denied the claims.
Mr Assange still faces the more serious accusation of rape, which he also denies.
The British Ambassador in Quito, Ecuador's capital, is to make the formal protest to the Ecuadorean government on Thursday.
""Ecuador must recognise that its decision to harbour Mr Assange more than three years ago has prevented the proper course of justice...

Mr Swire said the UK ""continues to have a legal obligation"" to extradite Mr Assange over the rape allegation.

Julian Assange profile
Mr Assange sought asylum three years ago to avoid extradition to Sweden, fearing he would then be sent to the US and put on trial for releasing secret American documents.
The UK has paid for policing around the embassy in Knightsbridge, central London, for the past three years.
The formal protest comes after Swedish prosecutors dropped their investigation into an allegation of sexual molestation and an accusation of unlawful coercion against Mr Assange because they ran out of time to question him.
An additional alleged incident of sexual molestation will be ""time barred"" - that is, time will run out to question Mr Assange - on 18 August.
The Swedish statement also said an allegation of rape was due to expire on 17 August 2020, but that investigation would continue.
The alleged events took place in August 2010.
Mr Assange said he was ""extremely disappointed"", adding the Swedish prosecutor had avoided hearing his side of the story.
Under Swedish law, charges cannot be laid without interviewing the suspect.
""There was no need for any of this. I am an innocent man. I haven't even been charged,"" said Mr Assange.
""From the beginning I offered simple solutions. Come to the embassy to take my statement or promise not to send me to the United States. This Swedish official refused both. She even refused a written statement.""
However, Sweden's director of public prosecution said a request to interview Mr Assange inside the embassy had been submitted but permission was yet to be granted.
Marianne Nye said she still hoped to arrange an interview as there were ""ongoing negotiations"" between Sweden and Ecuador.
One of Mr Assange's lawyers, Helena Kennedy, said: ""Julian Assange has spent more time incarcerated in the small rooms of the embassy, with no access to fresh air or exercise and contrary to international law, than he could ever spend in a Swedish prison on these allegations.""
Mr Assange's mother Christine said: ""I have privately shed many tears for many years - the terrible injustice of it all.""

7,7,"The UK could also be allowed to keep many of its trade terms with the EU so as to avoid disruption, Moody's said.
The report shows economic warnings from pro-EU groups have been ""baseless scaremongering"", Vote Leave said.
But the Britain Stronger in Europe group said it was further evidence that leaving would damage the economy.
The Moody's report comes after the CBI warned a British exit from the EU - known as a ""Brexit"" - could cost the UK economy Â£100bn and nearly one million jobs.
A vote to leave in the 23 June referendum would create significant uncertainty that would hamper economic growth, according to Moody's.
But the ratings agency said this would be partly offset by a decline in the pound - making UK exports more competitive - and by companies having time to adjust during UK-EU negotiations that it expects to last for at least two years.
""Our central view is that the negative economic impact of Brexit would be relatively small,"" the credit agency said.
As a result, Moody's would ""not expect to see significant increases in unemployment or [interest] rates, or substantial declines in property prices across the UK as a whole"".
Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said of the report: ""The UK will not face trade barriers after we Vote Leave, jobs will be safe and our credit rating will not be affected.""
However, Lucy Thomas, deputy director of Stronger In Europe, said: ""By leaving, we would unavoidably end up with worse trade terms. That would hit British industries such as car makers and financial services, putting jobs, low prices and financial security at risk for British people.
""Until the Leave campaigns can specify exactly how they would avoid that, going out on our own is a risk we can't afford to take.""
No trade deal would be as good as the one the UK currently has, she added.
Moody's said: ""We expect that, over time, the UK and EU would come to an arrangement to preserve most - but probably not all - of the current trading relationships, thereby limiting the impact on UK exporters and supply chains of UK importers.""
This is because both the UK and EU would want to avoid large-scale disruption, it said.
The ratings agency also pointed to HSBC's recent decision to keep its headquarters in London as evidence the capital would still be an attractive home for financial services firms.
""Although there are clear downside risks to the City of London's standing as a global financial centre, in our central scenario we do not see Brexit materially damaging its strong position,"" it said.
Gas, electricity, water and broadband networks would see ""little"" impact from a Leave vote, despite the UK having to replace existing EU regulations.
The agency looked at 200 UK companies for the report, finding that the risks of a ""Brexit"" would mainly centre around: additional trade barriers; investment decisions; regulatory changes; and curbs on migration.","The UK economy would be hit by leaving the EU, but the impact would be ""small"" and unlikely to lead to big job losses, according to credit agency Moody's.",35862774,"Sure!

8,8,"They made the connection on an expedition to the boy's village, Meliandou.
They took samples and chatted to locals to find out more about Ebola's source.
The team's findings are published in EMBO Molecular Medicine.
Meliandou is a small village of 31 houses.
It sits deep within the Guinean forest region, surrounded by towering reeds and oil palm cultivations - these are believed to have attracted the fruit bats carrying the virus passed on to Emile.
During their four-week field trip in April 2014, Dr Fabian Leendertz and colleagues found a large tree stump situated about 50m from Emile's home.
Villagers reported that children used to play frequently in the hollow tree.
Emile - who died of Ebola in December 2013 - used to play there, according to his friends.
The villagers said that the tree burned on March 24, 2014 and that once the tree caught fire, there issued a ""rain of bats"".
A large number of these insectivorous free-tailed bats - Mops condylurus in Latin - were collected by the villagers for food, but disposed of the next day after a government-led ban on bushmeat consumption was announced.
While bushmeat is thought to be a possible source of Ebola, the scientists believe it didn't trigger the outbreak.
Instead, it was Emile's exposure to the bats and their droppings as he played with his friends in the hollowed tree.
The scientists took and tested ash samples from the tree and found DNA traces that were a match for the animals.
While they were unable to test any of the bushmeat that the villagers had disposed of, they captured and tested any living bats they could find in and around Meliandou.
No Ebola could be detected in any of these hundred or so animals, however.
But previous tests show this species of bat can carry Ebola.
Dr Leendertz, from the Robert Koch Institute in Germany, and his colleagues say this must be a pretty rare occurrence though.
Dr Leendertz said: ""That is also obvious when you think about how many tonnes of bat meat is consumed every year.
""If more bats carried the virus, we would see outbreaks all the time.""
He says it is vital to find out more about the bats.
""They have moved into human settlements. They do not just live in the trees but also under the roofs of houses in the villages.
""The Ebola virus must jump through colonies from bat to bat, so we need to know more.""
But culling the animals is not the answer.
""We need to find ways to live together with the wildlife. These bats catch insects and pests, such as mosquitoes. They can eat about a quarter of their body weight in insects a day.
""Killing them would not be a solution.

16,16,"With all the walking, running, cycling and gym activity you intend to do, obviously you need an activity tracker -a small, trusty device that you can wear 24/7 to monitor every footstep, every mile clocked up, every calorie burned, and even the quality of every moment's shuteye.
You'll believe what it says. I mean, why wouldn't you?
Millions of these things have been sold, and you're not exactly going to buy multiple devices to check they come up with the same results.
And that's why I felt compelled to carry out this experiment for you.
I've spent a full week wearing four of the latest and best-known trackers to see if they all came up with the same results.
My findings? They don't. This isn't about which device presents your text messages to you, or comes in three shades of pink, but about cold, hard data.
The Garmin Vivosmart, Fitbit Charge, Misfit Shine and Jawbone Up Move are all in the dock.
At their worst, one day saw a variation between them of 23% in distance covered, and over the course of a week a difference in opinion between the Fitbit Charge and Jawbone Up Move of 2,649 calories burned - that's more than an entire day's calorie intake for someone of my build.
Both companies are united in saying that it's not the figures that matter, but the pattern.
Managing director of Fitbit Europe Gareth Jones advises people to simply be aware of the trend.
""Rather than get down to the half step or the next calorie is to look at the trend in their step pattern,"" he says,
""Are they increasing the number of steps in their day all week? Are they increasing the calorie burn day to day, week to week? Because it's that trend that's going to make you healthier.""
It's a sentiment echoed by Jawbone's head of international partner and product development, Jorgen Nordin.
""What's important really is that our system is all about getting better, becoming a better version of yourself,"" he says.
And maybe there is something in that.
Goodwill, good intention, motivation to improve your lifestyle and upping your own activity may become so enshrined in this new active tracked you that you transform your entire being.
Yet rely too much on the tech, inviting in third-party apps, inputting what you've eaten, and taking the figures as gospel, and you may just find it all going the wrong way.
But, surely buying a device is buying into the idea that precise data matters to you?
Well, Misfit's medical director Matthew Diamond explains it's not an exact science.
""Variations in algorithms, the sensors used, the characteristics of the individual wearing the device, like height and gait, as well as wearing position, can result in observed differences,"" he says.
That's not dissimilar to Mr Jones's view - he puts inaccuracies down in part to the lack of a standardised algorithm.
Yet it is acknowledged that trackers that incorporate heart-rate monitoring sensors offer better calorie burn accuracy, which could be interpreted as a nod to the fact they need to.
""Garmin's activity trackers are all about motivation, nudging the user to make healthier choices,"" says Chrissy Winchcombe, Garmin's marketing executive of wellness.
""You can also use it with a heart-rate monitor for more accurate calorie counting when exercising.""
Right now it feels as though a new device is launched weekly, some with looks to replicate mere watches. Others, like the Swarovski crystal, solar-powered Misfit - tracking abilities aside - would put J-Lo's bling to shame.
But providing stats and prompting ""do more exercise"" notifications are just the start of their makers' ambitions.
""With wearables and looking at the Jawbone band, you know so much about the individual that you can actually start using that information to make the internet of things more like the internet of you,"" says Jawbone's Jorgen Nordin.
""For example, you've been out running, you come home. Your house knows you've been running, not just because of the temperature of your skin, but it also knows you've been sweating based on sensors.
""Based on that information your stereo system could be playing some cool jazz to cool you down. Your Nest thermostat can cool down the house to help you get cooler.
""If you're in a house with a boiler connected to your shower, that could be turned on as you walk into your house.""
Mr Nordin has connected his Jawbone UP to turn his coffee machine on as soon as he wakes.
For most of us though, the simple question now is more likely to be: ""Is it still worth me wearing an activity tracker then?""
Sensors are still improving, and as we've seen, we can't expect military precision, but this is a personal choice.
Will I be laying mine to rest? No chance.
It makes me think more about my activity. It makes me walk instead of getting the bus.
It makes me feel smug at the end of the day (usually).
My husband I can compete over footsteps - don't worry, we have the same device.
And now, maybe I'll work that extra bit harder just in case it's going easy on me.","Filled with goodwill, unfathomable optimism and a slightly heavy heart, you embark on a health kick.",31113602,"According to an experiment involving four popular activity trackers, the devices do not always provide accurate data, with variations of up to 23% in distance covered and 2,649 calories burned over the course of a week, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on technology for health and fitness goals.",0,"Article: {}

17,17,"Rather amusingly, it's because the word ""patience"" was removed from the statement. Of course, it depends on how far the US labour market improves since inflation isn't an issue, so the jobs market looms larger for the US central bank with its dual mandate to address unemployment and inflation.
Still, looking at the forecasts of the individual rate setters, the median projection is for the interest rate to end the year at 0.625%, so that's a rate rise from the current 0-0.25%.
Markets were expecting this, which helps. Stocks rallied in part because the rate raise may not be very soon, as the US economy is weaker than the rate setters thought back in December. The key forecasts for the economy and inflation were all downgraded. Now, the US economy is expected to grow by 2.3-2.7% versus a top growth rate of 3% in the December forecasts. Inflation is also expected to be below the Fed's 2% target through 2016 when it may hover between 1.5-1.9%.
No repeat history
Indeed, investors don't like to be surprised, so part of what the Fed has to do is to manage expectations. And one of the concerns that's percolating right now is whether Fed raising rates or tightening could result in a repeat of the 1930's.
The period between 1937-1938 is known as a recession within a recession. It's when the US fell back into recession eight years after the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression. It happened after four years of cash printing, which pushed up stock prices.
In 1936, the Fed started to worry about its ""exit strategy"". When it started to tighten the money supply in 1937, it coincided with the end of a fiscal stimulus that reduced the budget deficit by some 2.5% of GDP. Unemployment soared again to 19% after falling to 14% from 25%, and the Dow Jones lost around one-third of its value during the sharp economic slump of 1937-38.
If it all sounds too familiar for comfort, that's why some are concerned about the Fed's move toward ""normalising"" interest rates, as it moves rates above 0% and back to pre-crisis levels. The last rate hike was eight years ago in 2007 and it's been at rock bottom pretty much since the 2008 financial crisis and the ensuing recession dubbed the Great Recession.
It shouldn't be surprising that the Fed will contemplate raising rates as it has been a long recovery. The delicate part is to manage expectations. But more than that, it's also ensuring that the economy is on a solid enough footing to normalise interest rates.
Acting prematurely could cause the Great Recession to truly parallel the Great Depression.
With growth and inflation both downgraded, but unemployment moving in the right direction, judging what ""premature"" means is no easy task. And communicating it to investors will also be crucial.",The Federal Reserve's latest statement suggests that the path is clear for an interest rate rise in June or September without surprising markets.,31954809,"The Federal Reserve's decision to keep interest rates low despite downgrades to growth and inflation forecasts has investors concerned about a repeat of the 1930s, and the Fed will need to carefully manage expectations and ensure the economy is solid enough to normalize interest rates without causing a new recession.",0,"Article: {}

19,19,"Fifa delegates are voting on their new president, but the incumbent Mr Blatter has refused to withdraw from the contest, despite the arrest of senior colleagues on major corruption charges.
The PM said Fifa could only rebuild its credibility if Mr Blatter left.
It comes as the UK's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said it was looking at material relating to the allegations.
Seven senior Fifa officials were arrested at a hotel in Switzerland on Wednesday.
The US Justice Department (DOJ) has charged 14 people with racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy.
Mr Cameron's comments followed Mr Blatter's call for unity at Fifa as delegates prepare to vote on his presidency.
Mr Blatter, who is expected to win a fifth term, said: ""I am appealing to unity and team spirit so we can move forward together.""
But speaking in Berlin, Mr Cameron said: ""You cannot have accusations of corruption at this level and on this scale in this organisation and pretend that the person currently leading it is the right person to take it forward.
""That cannot be the case. Frankly, what we've seen is the ugly side of the beautiful game and he should go.
""And the sooner that happens the better - the faster that organisation can start to rebuild its credibility, which is going to be so important because so many people around the world want to see this game properly managed, properly looked after, so we can all enjoy the World Cups of the future.""
Mr Cameron, who is holding EU reform talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, said it was ""unthinkable"" that Mr Blatter should stay.
He also said he would be ""guided"" by the Football Association (FA) chairman, Greg Dyke, over the question of whether the bids for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups should be opened.
Mr Dyke suggested earlier that he would not rule out a boycott of the major football tournaments if Mr Blatter remains at the helm of Fifa.
The Union of European Football Associations (Uefa), Europe's governing body, may consider boycotting future World Cups if Mr Blatter wins Friday's vote, according to Scottish FA chief executive Stewart Regan.
Meanwhile, the SFO said it was actively assessing ""material in its possession"" relating to Fifa corruption allegations.
It said it had ""made plain that it stands ready to assist ongoing international criminal investigations"".
It said its probe had been ongoing for months, before Wednesday's indictments.
Despite a global media and sporting storm, Fifa president Sepp Blatter is seeking re-election for a fifth term, with the only challenge coming from Jordan's Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.
The vote is taking place at the Fifa World Congress meeting in Zurich, Switzerland.
The SFO said it was not willing to comment further on the nature of material in its possession or current activity in this area.
It added that it had not launched a formal criminal investigation.  But it said there were two ways in which it could get involved - if the SFO opened a formal criminal investigation itself or provided ""mutual legal assistance"" to overseas law enforcement.
It also says it has made plain to both US and Swiss authorities that it stands ready to assist.
""There are currently international criminal investigations into allegations of corruption at Fifa. As such it would be inappropriate for the SFO to comment on the matter at this time,"" it said.

The society said the impact of political leaders had been ""minimal"".
It called for a ""root and branch"" review of the way referendums are run.
Recommendations made by the society in its report include having a public body intervene when ""misleading"" claims are made by campaigns, reviewing broadcasters' role and publishing a ""rule book"" to govern conduct by campaigns.
They also propose that future referendums have a guaranteed six month official campaign, and citizenship education be extended in schools with the voting age reduced to 16.
The UK voted to leave the EU on 23 June by 51.9% to 48.1%.
The then prime minister David Cameron and the government backed a Remain vote, while the Leave campaign was fronted by ex-mayor of London Boris Johnson, who is now foreign secretary.
The Electoral Reform Society, which campaigns for ""democratic reform"", said its polling showed Mr Cameron and other political ""big beasts"" had failed to convince the public.
When asked about eight prominent politicians, most people said they had had no effect on the way they voted.
The only high-profile figures who, according to the poll, persuaded more voters of their position than drove them to vote the other way were Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and US presidential candidate Donald Trump, who backed Brexit.
""Above all, what these numbers tell us is that people had by and large lost faith in established political figures as opinion-leaders - except where those figures might be said to be kicking against the establishment,"" the society said.
It said voters had viewed both sides as increasingly negative, and many ""simply did not trust"" their key claims. These included Remain saying households would be on average Â£4,300 a year worse off outside the EU and Leave claiming an extra Â£350m a week could be spent on the NHS.
The government's controversial mail-shot to every household in the UK had ""little effect on people's levels of informedness"", it said, and towards the end of the campaign nearly half of voters thought politicians were ""mostly telling lies"".
The society said the EU debate was in ""stark contrast"" to the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, which it said had featured a ""vibrant, well-informed, grassroots conversation that left a lasting legacy of on-going public participation in politics and public life"".
The society's chief executive Katie Ghose said: ""This report shows without a shadow of a doubt just how dire the EU referendum debate really was.
""There were glaring democratic deficiencies in the run-up to the vote, with the public feeling totally ill-informed. Both sides were viewed as highly negative by voters, while the top-down, personality-based nature of the debate failed to address major policies and issues, leaving the public in the dark.""
On the plus side, the society said it had heard ""time and again"" from people who felt the referendum was the first time their vote ""had truly counted"".
But it said there were ""serious questions"" to be asked about the place of referendums in politics, including how they sit alongside the parliamentary system and how to ensure a ""high quality"" debate.
Ms Ghose added: ""Now that the dust is starting to settle after the EU referendum, we need a complete rethink about the role of referendums in the UK. They are becoming more common, but the piecemeal nature of the how, when and why they're done means we could simply end up jumping from referendum to referendum at the whim of politicians.""

She won two Nobel Prizes, in physics and chemistry. Yet even so, she was turned down for membership of the prestigious French Academie des Sciences in 1911, the very year she went on to win her second Nobel Prize.
The Nobel laureate Sir Tim Hunt was heavily criticised for his disparaging remarks about women in science last week, which for some raised the issue of where women stood in the scientific community.
The larger truth is that women have made big and important discoveries in science - think of Dorothy Hodgkin, the brilliant crystallographer who mapped the structure of penicillin and went on to be awarded a Nobel Prize in 1964.
Hodgkin was the first woman to win the prestigious Copley Medal, and she remains the only British woman to have won a Nobel in the sciences. Yet at the time, the newspapers carried headlines such as ""Oxford housewife wins Nobel"".
But many female scientists in the past were not given the credit they deserved for their achievements. As a result, their names have all but disappeared from public consciousness.
Here are just a few.
Esther Lederberg, a microbiologist, conducted groundbreaking research in the field of genetics.
She developed basic techniques that have gone a long way towards helping scientists understand how genes work.
Her work helped her husband, Joshua, win a Nobel prize in 1958, but she was not cited in the award.
The British biophysicist Rosalind Franklin was a pioneering X-ray crystallographer.
Her image of the DNA molecule was critical to deciphering its structure - one of the biggest and most important scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century - but it was James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins who received the 1962 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for their work.
Ida Tacke made huge advances in both chemistry and atomic physics.
It was she who managed to find two new elements, rhenium and masurium, that Dmitri Mendeleev had predicted would form part of the periodic table.
She gets credit in the science books for the discovery of rhenium.
But masurium is now known as technetium, the discovery of which is attributed to Carlo Perrier and Emilio Segre.
Tacke's evidence was ignored until Perrier and Segre artificially created the element in a laboratory.
Tacke is also credited with being the first person to open up the idea of nuclear fission.
Lise Meitner's work in nuclear physics led to the discovery of nuclear fission - where atomic nuclei split in two.
This laid the groundwork for the atomic bomb.
After moving to Berlin in 1907, Meitner collaborated with chemist Otto Hahn over many decades.
But Hahn published their findings without including Meitner as a co-author.
And he went on to win the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for his contributions to splitting the atom.
Chien-Shiung Wu was one of the most important physicists of the 20th Century.
She participated in the development of the atom bomb, as part of the Manhattan Project. Yet few know her name today.
In the 1950s, two theoretical physicists, Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen Ning Yang, asked Wu to help disprove what is known in physics as the law of parity.  Wu's experiments turned this law on its head.
This landmark moment in physics led to a 1957 Nobel Prize for Yang and Lee, but not for Wu, who was left out despite the key role she played.
Another neglected pioneer is the astronomer Henrietta Leavitt, who helped change the way we see the universe.
She began her work by measuring and recording stars at the Harvard Observatory - one of the few jobs in science that was considered suitable for women.
Leavitt spotted a pattern between the brightness of a star and its distance from the Earth.
This led her to uncover what is known as the period-luminosity relationship, allowing scientists to calculate how far away a star was from Earth based on its brightness.
The Royal Society - swift in its condemnation of Sir Tim's remarks - was founded in 1660 and has yet to elect a female president.
It represents the scientific establishment in the UK, and its early members included Isaac Newton and Robert Hooke.
Women were not permitted to become fellows until 1945, almost 300 years after its foundation.
Some say that the comments from Sir Tim - a prominent fellow of the society - will damage the efforts it is making to improve diversity.
It has been reported that only 6% of its fellows - a prestigious title in the world of science - are women.
That statistic, some say, sums up the scale of the wider problem of the difficulties faced by women in the scientific world.","A quick web search for the world's most famous scientists lists, among others, Galileo, Einstein, Newton, Darwin, Stephen Hawking and Alexander Fleming.",33157396,"The article highlights the contributions of several neglected female scientists, such as Marie Curie, Dorothy Hodgkin, Esther Lederberg, Rosalind Franklin, Ida Tacke, Lise Meitner, Chien-Shiung Wu, and Henrietta Leavitt, who made significant discoveries in their respective fields but were often overlooked or excluded from credit and recognition, highlighting the ongoing struggle for gender equality in science.",0,"Article: {}

35,35,"Media playback is not supported on this device
The credibility of records was examined following the sport's doping scandal.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, called the proposals ""cowardly"".
""I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity,"" she said, adding that the governing bodies had ""again failed clean athletes"".
Svein Arne Hansen, the European Athletics president, said world records ""are meaningless if people don't really believe them"".
However, Radcliffe said the changes were ""heavy handed"" and ""confusing to the public"".
European Athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records in January. Its ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants the sport's world governing body, the IAAF, to adopt the changes it sets out.
Media playback is not supported on this device
If the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria:
The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an ""all-time list"", but not be officially recognised as records.
This would include Jonathan Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Colin Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon mark of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers.
Mary Keitany of Kenya broke Radcliffe's women's-only world record to win the 2017 London Marathon in two hours 17 minutes one second, the second-fastest time in history.
The council also recommended that a performance should be wiped from record books if the athlete had committed a ""doping or integrity violation, even if it does not directly impact the record performance"".
The proposals are a response to last year's McLaren report, which uncovered widespread doping in sport - and athletics in particular. Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition unless they can satisfy strict criteria to show they are clean.
More than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples.
""There are records in which people in the sport, the media and the public do not have complete confidence,"" added taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.
IAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were ""a step in the right direction"".
""There will be athletes, current record holders, who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them, but if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area,"" he said.
European Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting.
""What we are proposing is revolutionary and not just because most world and European records will have to be replaced,"" Hansen added.
""We want to raise the standards for recognition to a point where everyone can be confident that everything is fair and above board.""
Radcliffe has previously criticised plans to wipe records from the books and last month told BBC Sport she favoured making doping a criminal offence instead to deter cheats.
She issued a statement on Monday criticising the new proposals and athletics governing bodies.
""I worked extremely hard for my PBs and they will always be valid to me. I know they were set through hard work and best effort and abiding by all the rules and am proud of them,"" Radcliffe wrote.
""Governing bodies have a duty to protect every clean athlete, here they again fail those athletes. We had to compete against cheats, they couldn't provide us a level playing field, we lost out on medals, moments and earnings due to cheats, saw our sport dragged through the mud due to cheats and now, thanks to those who cheat we potentially lose our World and Area records.
""Although we are moving forward I don't believe we are yet at the point where we have a testing procedure capable of catching every cheat out there, so why reset at this point? Do we really believe a record set in 2015 is totally clean and one in 1995 not?
""I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity. It is a heavy handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted.
""It is confusing to the public at a time when athletics already struggles to market itself. How do they explain how stadium, club and national records are better than the Area or World marks or will they force all those to be to wiped out too?""","All athletics world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a ""revolutionary"" new proposal from European Athletics.",39774233,"The European Athletics governing body has proposed new rules that would wipe out existing world records and replace them with ones that meet stricter criteria, including the use of blood and urine samples for doping tests, in response to the sport's doping scandal and to restore credibility to the records.",1,"Article: {}

Students on those courses can also apply for Student Finance Wales loans and grants.

He added: ""Each season Picasso has the remarkable ability to surprise, and tonight was no exception, with the unusual appearance of two Blue Period works, which set new benchmarks - both in oil and on paper.""
La Gommeuse, described as most the important blue period Picasso to come to the market in a generation, was painted in 1901.
The portrait is of a nude unnamed woman. Gommeuse, which translates into English as 'gummy' was a sexually charged slang word of the time for cafe-concert singers and their songs.
It features a second portrait on the reverse of the canvas, which was hidden for a century until its discovery in 2000 during conservation work.
The caricature of Picasso's friend Pere Manach was apparently intended as a gift for the Catalan anarchist who shared the artist's studio flat in the Boulevard de Clichy in Paris.
The painting was one of 47 works on offer, with just over three-quarters finding buyers.
At least two of the top 10 lots were bought by Asian private collectors, continuing a trend of recent seasons.

The first public trams started running at 06:00 BST.

He told the CBI that Labour's planned ""national investment bank"" would boost lending to small and medium-size firms.
The Tories said Labour only offered ""spending, borrowing and taxing"".
Mr Corbyn told delegates at the CBI's conference he would not tell them how to run their organisations but would not ""stand back when there is injustice in the workplace or the boardroom"".
He warned of ""real problems"" in today's jobs market, citing low wages, insecure temporary contracts and the gender pay gap.

Labour says it would increase borrowing to invest in infrastructure, and Mr Corbyn urged Chancellor Philip Hammond to ""change course and take the bold action necessary to support our economy"".
He said Labour would increase investment in green technology and boost house building.
Labour's ""settlement for business"", he said, ""will mean some increase in corporation tax while maintaining one of the lowest rates in the world"".
He added: ""But see it as a sound investment not only in your own business's long-term future but for the common good of the country.""
Mr Corbyn also warned of a ""chaotic"" Brexit and said Labour would campaign for Britain to ""retain full access to the single market"".

Penalty notices totalling more than Â£385,000 which were given to 12,000 drivers in Coppergate were refunded after the council abandoned the scheme in 2014, less than a year after it was introduced.

After that, a letter will be sent for a first offence, with a fine for a second one.

Her family believed they had met the requirements of her visa, which expires later this month.
Immigration officials said they had been working with the family and made no arrangements to remove Mrs Grant.
However, the grandmother's family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that they had not found Australia's immigration department helpful and had gone to specialists for assistance.
They could apply for a new visa but were told that this could take 30 years to resolve.
The Grant family had hoped that because of her age and state of her heath that her situation might be treated a special case.
Mrs Grant's surviving son Allan and his wife Diane believe they have done everything to meet the rules of her visa after she moved to live with them in Australia.
Mrs Grant is booked on a flight back to the UK on 26 July, the date her visitor visa expires.
Her family told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that the alternatives were the possibility of deportation or ""years of limbo"" while trying to obtain a new visa.
Mrs Grant, who is partially sighted and has dementia, was living near Grantown on Spey in the Highlands.
Her son Robert had been helping to look after her.
Because of the state of her health, Allan and Diane asked her to move to Australia and live with them.
They applied for a visa for her to come to Australia.
A condition of her visa was that she had to depart Australia once every 12 months but could return.
Concerned that Mrs Grant was not fit enough to fly out of Australia to meet this requirement, her family booked her on a cruise to Vanuatu, a group of islands in the South Pacific Ocean.
They believed that this trip would meet the visa requirements.
However, after the cruise the Grants were told by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection that the visa rules had not been met.
Diane told Good Morning Scotland that immigration specialists had told the family that applying for a new visa could take up to 30 years to come through.
They are now preparing to fly with Mrs Grant back to Scotland.
Diane said: ""We will have to help her find a home over there.
""We have our own life here in Australia and, while I don't want to live there, Mum wants to live here.""
The Grants have highlighted their case in an effort to alert other families that may find themselves in the same situation.

A spokesperson said: ""The department is familiar with Ms Grant's case and is not making any arrangements to remove her from Australia.

47,48,"The military says all but eight of the 129 girls have escaped, but parents of the girls say many are still missing.
It is thought Islamist militant group Boko Haram took the girls to forested areas near the Cameroonian border.
The group is waging a bloody campaign for an Islamic state in northern Nigeria.
Nigerian students living in fear
What is Nigeria's Boko Haram?
Also on Wednesday, 18 people were killed in an attack in the Gwoza district of north-eastern Nigeria, local officials told the AP news agency.
The BBC's correspondent in Lagos, Will Ross, says the Nigerian military's statement that most of the girls had escaped their captors contrasts sharply with other information available to the BBC, including the claims of parents of pupils at the school. They insist ""many"" of their children are still missing.
The raid on the boarding school is a great source of embarrassment for the Nigerian authorities who say their military campaign against the militants is succeeding, he adds.
Hours before the military issued its statement, the governor of Borno state Kashim Shettima said the vast majority of the girls were still missing and offered a reward of 50m naira ($308,000; Â£184,000) for information.
The air force, army, police, local defence units and volunteers have all been involved in the search for the schoolgirls.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon condemned the ""shocking"" mass abduction and called for the girls' immediate release.
""The targeting of schools and schoolchildren is a grave violation of international humanitarian law,"" he said in a statement.
""Schools are, and must remain, safe places where children can learn and grow in peace.""
The BBC's Hausa Service says Boko Haram has kidnapped civilians in the past - usually women to work as sex slaves.
Gunmen reportedly arrived at the school in Chibok, a remote area of Borno state, late on Tuesday, and ordered its teenage residents on to lorries.
A local politician said about 50 soldiers had been stationed near the school ahead of annual exams, but were apparently overpowered.
Local residents reported hearing explosions followed by gunfire.
""Many girls were abducted by the rampaging gunmen who stormed the school in a convoy of vehicles,"" local education official Emmanuel Sam told the AFP news agency.
A girl who managed to escape and did not want to be named told the BBC that she and fellow students were sleeping when armed men burst into their hostel.
The girl said she and her schoolmates were taken away in a convoy, which had to slow down after some of the vehicles developed a fault, at which point 10 to 15 girls escaped.
""We ran into the bush and waited until daybreak before we went back home,"" she said.
Nigerian media reported that two members of the security forces had been killed, and residents said 170 houses were burnt down during the attack.
The militants know the terrain well and the military has had only limited success in previous efforts to dislodge them from their forest hide-outs.
Militants from Boko Haram - which means ""Western education is forbidden"" in the local Hausa language - frequently target educational institutions.
This year, the group's fighters have killed more than 1,500 civilians in three states in north-east Nigeria, which are currently under emergency rule.
The government recently said that Boko Haram's activities were confined to that part of the country.

Overton, who was unused by England in last week's three-game T20 series with South Africa despite being called up to the squad, bowled a crucial spell to turn the tide.
With Liam Dawson (53) and Adams going well in their patient opening stand, the fast bowler found the latter's outside edge before Rossouw top-edged through to Steven Davies to go for a fifth duck in his last eight County Championship innings.
Dawson fell lbw soon after to Lewis Gregory (3-51) and, despite James Vince's 47, Hampshire's batting fell apart as Leach's accurate left-arm spin gave nothing away.
With a batting point secured, Hampshire captain George Bailey declared, but Marcus Trescothick (10 not out) and debutant Eddie Byrom, who was unbeaten on one, had no troubles reaching stumps under the floodlights.
Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson told BBC Solent:
""The crowds haven't changed. We haven't had any more people in. But it is early days and it is something that might work.
""From my first experience of it, they need to have a good look at what balls they are going to use. If you are going to keep on using those balls then you are going to get some pretty boring cricket.
""It was fine to see. It just goes very soft, very quickly.""
Somerset fast bowler Craig Overton told BBC Radio Bristol:
""The ball was strange. It swings and then goes really soft. It didn't really do much maybe a little bit in it for the bowlers but because it is so soft and slow it is tough to score on.
""We knew it was going to be tough batting after lights so it is perfect to be nought down with Tres and Eddie.
""It was nice to be with the England boys and see how it all works.

57,58,"Kepler-452b orbits at a very similar distance from its star, though its radius is 60% larger.
Mission scientists said they believed it was the most Earth-like planet yet.
Such worlds are of interest to astronomers because they might be small and cool enough to host liquid water on their surface - and might therefore be hospitable to life.
Nasa's science chief John Grunsfeld called the new world ""Earth 2.0"" and the ""closest so far"" to our home.
It is around 1,400 light years away from Earth.
Jon Jenkins, Kepler data analysis lead at Nasa's Ames Research Center in California, added: ""It's a real privilege to deliver this news to you today. There's a new kid on the block that's just moved in next door.""
The new world joins other exoplanets such as Kepler-186f that are similar in many ways to Earth.
Determining which is most Earth-like depends on the properties one considers. Kepler-186f, announced in 2014, is smaller than the new planet, but orbits a red dwarf star that is significantly cooler than our own.
Kepler-452b, however, orbits a parent star which belongs to the same class as the Sun: it is just 4% more massive and 10% brighter. Kepler-452b takes 385 days to complete a full circuit of this star, so its orbital period is 5% longer than Earth's.
The mass of Kepler-452b cannot be measured yet, so astronomers have to rely on models to estimate a range of possible masses, with the most likely being five times that of Earth. If it is rocky, the world would likely still have active volcanism and its gravity could be roughly twice that on our own planet.
The new world is included in a haul of 500 new possible planets sighted by the Kepler space telescope around distant stars.
Twelve of the new candidates are less than twice Earth's diameter, orbiting in the so-called habitable zone around their star.
This zone refers to a range of distances at which the energy radiated by the star would permit water to exist as a liquid on the planet's surface if certain other conditions are also met.
Of these 500 candidates, Kepler-452b is the first to be confirmed as a planet.
Dr Suzanne Aigrain, from the University of Oxford, who was not involved with the study, told BBC News: ""I do believe the properties described for Kepler-452b are the most Earth-like I've come across for a confirmed planet to date.
""What seems even more significant to me is the number of planets in the habitable zone of their host stars with radii below two Earth radii; 12 is quite a few compared to the pre-existing Kepler planet catalogue.
""It bodes well for their attempts to provide a more robust measure of the incidence of Earth-like planets, which is the top-level goal of the Kepler mission.""
While similar in size and brightness to the Sun, Kepler-452b's host star is 1.5 billion years older than ours. Scientists working on the mission therefore believe it could point to a possible future for the Earth.
""If Kepler-452b is indeed a rocky planet, its location vis-a-vis its star could mean that it is just entering a runaway greenhouse phase of its climate history,"" explained Dr Doug Caldwell, a Seti Institute scientist working on the Kepler mission.
""The increasing energy from its aging sun might be heating the surface and evaporating any oceans. The water vapour would be lost from the planet forever.""
""Kepler-452b could be experiencing now what the Earth will undergo more than a billion years from now, as the Sun ages and grows brighter.""
Dr Don Pollacco, from Warwick University, UK, who was not involved with the latest analysis, told the BBC: ""Kepler data allows you to estimate the relative size of a planet to its host star, so if you know the size of the host, hey presto, you know the size of the planet.
""However, to go further - i.e. is it rocky? - involves measuring the mass of the planets and this is much more difficult to do as the stars are too far away for these measurements (which are incredibly difficult) to make.
""So in reality they have no idea what this planet is made of: It could be rock but it could be a small gassy ball or something more exotic maybe.""
Dr Chris Watson, from Queen's University Belfast, UK, commented: ""Other Kepler habitable zone planets may well be more Earth-like in this respect. For example, Kepler-186f is approximately 1.17 Earth radii, and Kepler-438b is approximately 1.12 Earth radii.
""In fact, at 1.6 Earth radii, this would place Kepler-452b in a category of planet called a 'Super-Earth' - our Solar System does not actually have any planet of this type within it! Super-Earths are hugely interesting for this reason, but one might then say, well, is it really 'Earth-like' given all this?""
He added: ""When we look at the type of star Kepler-452b orbits, then it seems to be a star not too dissimilar to our Sun... The other Kepler habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far tend to be orbiting M-dwarfs - stars far cooler than our Sun, and therefore the planets need to orbit much closer to receive the same levels of heating.
""So it may be a potentially rocky super-Earth in an Earth-like orbit (in terms of host star and orbital distance). It's this combination of the host star and orbit that set it apart in my opinion.""
The findings have been accepted for publication in The Astronomical Journal.

""There's real anticipation this year,"" Doncaster told BBC Radio Scotland.
""It's good for the profile of the top tier to have the very biggest city clubs back.""
Neilson has said a top-six finish would represent success for the Edinburgh club this season.
Doncaster believes the exciting drama of last season augurs well for the new campaign.
""After such an exciting end to last season: we had Aberdeen pushing Celtic close at the top and we had an incredible battle at the bottom of the Premiership with the top of the Championship in the play-offs; absolutely endorsing the decision the clubs made a couple of years ago to create them,"" he said.

""We welcome Hearts back this year and a lot of people will be looking to see how Robbie Neilson gets on.""
Doncaster also responded to reports that the SPFL has been inundated by complaints that all 10 in League Two clubs will be worse off as a result of corporate hospitality and advertising requirements in the ruling body's new £2m sponsorship agreement with Ladbrokes.
""I read that I was inundated with complaints which seemed a bit hyperbolic,"" he said.
""I had two clubs who emailed me with some queries on the deal. There is a concern about the distribution model and the way in which the sponsorship revenue is divvied up.
""But the reality is that if you look at broadcasting revenue, that gets divvied up amongst all 42 clubs and League Two clubs don't put anything into that deal.
""So, I think it's a fair distribution model and has delivered more money for clubs than under the old split league system - with the SFL operating independently of the SPL - I think the vast majority of clubs are delighted with the way the merger has panned out and the way the SPFL is operating.

The PM has pledged an in/out referendum by the end of 2017, while the Lib Dems are ""unambiguous"" in their EU support.
Meanwhile, some firms criticised the use of their quotes in a Labour advert.
Mr Miliband used the first official day of election campaigning to unveil his party's Better Plan for Business during a speech at Bloomberg's European headquarters in London.
'Over-stepped the mark'
To reinforce Labour's business message, the party also took out a full-page advertisement in the Financial Times, setting out its determination to ""put the interests of Britain and British business first rather than risk an EU exit"".
But a spokesman for Siemens said Labour had ""over-stepped the mark"" by quoting its chief executive, Juergen Maier, in the advert.
In it, Mr Maier says: ""The prospect of a referendum that may or may not happen, at a date yet to be decided upon, with a choice between two unknown options, is profoundly worrying for business leaders.""
While the quote is not disputed, a spokeswoman said the firm would be contacting Labour to express its displeasure.
""We did not give them permission [to use the quote]. We did not know about this. We are an apolitical organisation,"" she said.
Analysis by Business Editor Kamal Ahmed
Labour has quoted a number of pro-EU company leaders in the full page advert the party has taken out in the FT today.
""We would be devastated - as a company that loves London and wants to be in London - if Britain were out of Europe,"" is the view of Andrew Mackenzie, chief executive of the mining giant, BHP Billiton.
My Labour sources were being very careful to explain last night that the business leaders quoted in the advert were not endorsing Labour.
They were simply being quoted to show the strength of feeling about Europe.
What is interesting is that Labour has chosen the first day of the election campaign to focus on an area - business - some see as a weakness for the party.

Kellogg's said ""eyebrows were raised internally"" when the company was told its head of UK and EU operations, Jonathan Myers, would be quoted. But a spokesman said it was too late to have the remarks removed by the time they were told about them on Sunday afternoon.
Asked about the quotes, Mr Miliband said: ""We've simply quoted public statements by these businesses about the place of Britain in the European Union.
""Lots of businesses all round this country aren't necessarily going to be supporting Labour or the Conservatives but they do have a very strong view about our place in the EU.""
'Start a revolution'
Meanwhile, Labour's economic claims were also called into question by one of its leading donors, Dr Assem Allam, who told the Daily Telegraph that its plans for a ""mansion tax"" and a rise in the top rate of tax were ""alienating"" wealth-creators.
Mr Miliband retorted that unlike the Conservatives, Labour ""donors will have particular views on things - we don't always do what our donors say"".
The Labour leader launched his party's manifesto on the eve of a party political broadcast by Hollywood actor and Sherlock star Martin Freeman who is set to endorse Labour's values of ""community, compassion and decency"".
The 22-page manifesto promises to cut and freeze business rates for more than 1.5 million small business properties, while at the same time creating an independent National Infrastructure Commission and a British Investment Bank that will support a network of regional banks to boost competition on the High Street.
Mr Miliband also promised ""to start a revolution in vocational education"" that will ensure all young people study English and maths to 18, with a guaranteed apprenticeship for those that work hard and get the grades.
Mr Balls insisted the manifesto would not include any pledges that required ""additional borrowing"" - but the Conservatives warned that a Labour government would raise taxes for every working family in Britain by £3,028.
'Banging on about Europe'
But it was the EU that Mr Miliband focused on - and what he sees as the consequences of an in/out EU referendum.
Pledging to return Britain to ""a leadership role"" in a reformed EU, he said: ""There could be nothing worse for our country or for our great exporting businesses than playing political games with our membership of the European Union - I'm not going to do it.""
Main pledges
Policy guide: Where the parties stand
He said David Cameron ""came to power promising to stop his party 'banging on about Europe'. Now if he has his way, he'll have us inside Europe banging on the door to leave or, even worse, outside Europe - banging on the door to be let back in.""
""It's simply the wrong direction for our country,"" he said.
""We'll show strong leadership to get the best for Britain. We won't condemn this country to years of uncertainty, years of insecurity, by threatening our European future.""
But Simon Walker, director general of the Institute of Directors, said his members thought it was ""sensible"" to hold an EU referendum based on reforms, and he warned Labour ""there's more to business than just Europe"".

Scottish full-back Stuart Hogg ran in the opening try but Leigh Halfpenny's three penalties and a slick Rhys Webb score put Wales 16-10 up by half-time.
A disallowed Liam Williams effort and a missed Halfpenny penalty gave Scotland hope that they could recover.
But Jon Welsh's late try was not enough after Jonathan Davies had powered over.
Wales are now back on track to mount a championship challenge, but despite the Scots' improvement, they still seem a little short of the Six Nations heavyweights.
Warren Gatland's side arrived in Edinburgh reeling from that loss to a patchwork England side.
Scotland also began the tournament with a defeat, to France in Paris, but there was enough in their display to give their fans hope they could beat Wales for the first time in the Gatland era.
The Scots had spoken of keeping the penalty count down, but they conceded three in the first five minutes, one of which was kicked by Halfpenny to give Wales the lead.
As the Welsh began to build pressure, they were hit by a breakaway try.
Alex Cuthbert lost possession and Richie Gray shipped the ball wide to Hogg, who showed great speed to race past the cover defence and score under the posts. Laidlaw's conversion and a subsequent penalty put the Scots 10-3 up before Halfpenny responded with a three-pointer of his own.
Scotland lost fly-half Finn Russell to the sin-bin on the half-hour when he was judged to have taken out opposite number Dan Biggar with a dangerous tackle in the air. Halfpenny brought the score to 10-9 with the resultant penalty.
Wales did not take long to make their one-man advantage count, a sweeping move from inside their own half stretching the Scots' defence to breaking point, and scrum-half Webb diving over in the corner.
Halfpenny added the extras to put Wales 16-10 up at the break.
Two Laidlaw penalties either side of a successful Halfpenny kick kept the Scots within three early in the second-half.
Wales had a Liam Williams try ruled out for an off-the-ball infringement by Alun Wyn Jones, but the referee could not save Scotland 15 minutes from the end when Davies scored Wales' second try.
The British and Irish Lion came on to a Biggar pass at pace and, after powering through some soft midfield tackling, the centre coasted under the posts to leave Halfpenny with the simplest of conversions to give Wales a 10-point lead.
That looked to have ended the match as a contest, but the Scots refused to buckle, with Mark Bennett and Hogg making searing line breaks.
They did force a try in the dying seconds when Welsh ploughed over from close range, but it was too late and once again the home side had to be content with the 'gallant losers' tag.

Mr Kikukawa said he regretted not revealing the accounting irregularities earlier.
""There is no mistake. The entire responsibility lies with me,"" Mr Kikukawa said in court on Tuesday.
He also apologised for the trouble caused to investors, customers, employees and the general public.
The scandal was revealed when Mr Woodford, the British chief executive, was dismissed from his post after he challenged Mr Kikukawa and the board over suspiciously large payments related to acquisitions.
An investigation was launched that revealed a cover-up of losses.
Mr Kikukawa, former executive vice-president Hisashi Mori and former auditing officer Hideo Yamada were arrested in February and later indicted on suspected violation of the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act.","Former Olympus chairman Tsuyoshi Kikukawa has pleaded guilty to charges of falsifying accounts, covering up losses of $1.7bn (Â£1.1bn), at the opening of his trial.",19709609,"Sure!

76,77,"Human Rights Watch believes Nato air strikes killed at least 72 civilians and says the organisation needs to bear responsibility where appropriate.
""We're calling for prompt, credible and thorough investigations,"" HRW's Fred Abrahams told BBC News.
Nato insists it took unprecedented care to minimise civilian casualties.
It argues that it cannot take responsibility because it has had no presence on the ground to confirm the deaths.
Aircraft from the US, the UK and France conducted most of the 9,658 strike sorties last year, targeting forces loyal to Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi.
In March, another human rights organisation,  
          Amnesty International, said it had documented 55 cases
 of named civilians, including 16 children and 14 women, killed in air strikes.
It described Nato's failure to investigate these cases thoroughly as ""deeply disappointing"".
The point of the Nato air campaign in Libya last year was to protect civilians, so how many innocent people died is still a sensitive issue, BBC diplomatic correspondent Bridget Kendall reports.
In its report published on Monday, HRW said it had examined in detail evidence of claims of civilian deaths from eight separate Nato strikes.
In one instance, it said a first Nato bomb killed 14 people and a second bomb, moments later, killed 18 more who had rushed to help victims.
What concerns Mr Abrahams, the main author of the report, is that the deaths remain unacknowledged and the families have been offered no compensation.
""Until now, Nato has taken a position of denial,"" he said.
Source: Nato
""They refuse to give information about how they died and they refuse to investigate, and it is this lack of transparency that is deeply troubling.
""I think it will lead to unnecessary civilian deaths in the future if Nato refuses to look at what went wrong and make corrections.""

80,81,"The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said the area used to farm the poppy plant, the source of opium, increased by 10% to 201,000 hectares.
But better farming conditions resulted in a higher yield per hectare, increasing overall production.
Afghanistan is the world's largest producer of the substance, which is the main ingredient in heroin.
Growing opium is a crime in the country, but it is still a major cash crop for impoverished farming communities.
The Taliban also taxes poppy production in areas it controls, which is a major source of income for its military activities.
UNODC Executive Director Yury Fedotov said the figures were ""a worrying reversal in efforts"".
The opium produced from the poppy plant is used to make some of the most powerful medicinal painkillers, such as morphine.
However, many nations cultivate their own supply for medicinal use, and Afghanistan's production of illicit opium is primarily sued for the illegal drug trade.
The Afghan government has a stated policy of eradicating poppy crops, but the crop is widespread in many government-controlled regions, and officials are often accused of turning a blind eye.
Earlier this year, the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt visited poppy farms in the north-east, where one farmer told him the local government knew about his crop, but ""they also know it is the only way anyone can make decent money.""
Just 355 hectares (877 acres) of poppies were eradicated by provincial authorities in the last year - down more than  90% since 2015, when almost 4,000 hectares were cleared.
Seven insurgents and one officer died during attacks on eradication teams this year. Seven more people were injured.
The southern region of the country is the most productive area, accounting for 54% of the entire national opium production.
Helmand province, which has seen a resurgent Taliban presence, is the single largest producer, with more than 80,000 hectares of poppy cultivation.

The marine was on leave in Olongapo on 11 October 2014, after joint military exercises with the Philippine army, when he met Ms Laude in a bar.
Police said they left together and checked into a hotel, where she was found dead the next day, apparently strangled and with her head inside the hotel toilet.
Pemberton had previously testified in court that he had attacked Ms Laude after he realised she was transgender, but said she was still alive when he left the room.

""The money that we have raised will restore the pier but beyond that it needs to have an economically viable future and that's what we hope we will create.""
The Panamanian company Ravenclaw, which owned the pier, was issued with a compulsory purchase order after it failed to carry out repair work.
The order was granted in 2012 and the council formally took ownership of the pier in August.

86,87,"The proposals, which are subject to parliamentary approval, allow farmers to clear drainage ditches and streams without asking permission.
Farmers had complained that the Environment Agency was micro-managing flood control.
But academics told BBC News that diverting water off farmland could increase floods where people live.
The policy change was announced Environment Minister Liz Truss at the Oxford Farming Conference after what the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said were two successful pilot schemes.
She said: ""We will allow farmers across the country to maintain their own ditches up to 1.5km in length from April, so they can clear debris and manage the land.""
The decision was welcomed by the National Farmers' Union (NFU).
Its president, Meurig Raymond, said: ""The NFU has pressed Defra and the Environment Agency to enable farmers to undertake minor works for many years.""
But Professor Alan Jenkins from the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology said he feared the policy could backfire.
""Waterlogged fields are no use to farmers,"" he said. ""They can't maintain their productivity on waterlogged soil so it makes sense for them to manage their fields accordingly.
""There is a potential downside however, in that if we increase drainage in fields during heavy rainfall it's possible there will be increased and faster transmission of water in the river system with a possible increase in flood risk downstream.""
Katherine Pygott from the consultancy firm Peter Brett agreed.
""If you are a landowner you may want to maximise productivity on a grouse moor by making it drier - but if you are trying to protect a town you want to keep water back on the uplands.
""It very much depends on local conditions - sometimes it would be unhelpful to speed drainage, sometimes it would not.
""There is a risk of making a free-for-all on drainage. It would be more sensible to make the existing system work.""

Mr Justice Wyn Williams said Jones had shown no remorse for his ""wicked and despicable"" actions.

90,91,"Kensington and Chelsea Council won an earlier case against Sophie Sotello in the magistrates' court after she refused to comply with the order.
When she appealed against the decision, the council dropped its case.
It said that it was now satisfied with evidence showing that her son, 11-year-old Gabriel Sotello, was receiving a suitable education.
Gabriel Sotello is one of more than 21,000 children on local council records as being home schooled.
According to the home education group Ed Yourself numbers have grown rapidly - by 17% between July 2013 and July 2014.
Many of these pupils, like Gabriel, have never been to school. Others have been taken out because their parents felt they were being bullied, neglected or were not reaching their potential.
Home schooled children do not have to follow the national curriculum or take part in public exams such as GCSEs or A-levels.
Mrs Sotello says her role is not to teach Gabriel, but to point him in the right direction.
""I wouldn't dream of saying I teach him,"" she says. ""I facilitate, I find the books, I research with them, I give them the power if you like.  It is child centred, finding out what makes them tick.""
Gabriel initiates much of his own learning and says he is inspired by the freedom to focus on what most interests him.
""Freedom is what makes learning still fun,"" he says. ""In home education you can learn at your own pace and you do learn much quicker.""
Parents give various reasons for shunning school, and taking direct responsibility for educating their children.
Jackie Fahy, who organises a weekly meeting in a London park for like-minded parents, says some doubt the worth of the regimented school curriculum.
""A lot of children come out of school not prepared. The workplace is changing so rapidly that actually the school system is huge and vast and slow to change.  I'm not sure that children will be prepared for having several careers in a lifetime.""
Elizabeth Lil - who opted to educate her son and daughter herself - says that as a former teacher she felt that barely a tenth of her time in school was actually benefiting children.
""I was a science teacher, I did maths. I've so far used trigonometry once in my adult life. What you learn at school is not necessarily the skills you need for your adult life.""
These parents complain that councils are exceeding their powers by carrying out routine inspections of the quality of their children's education.
They insist that councils should intervene only if they have evidence that something is wrong.
But grey areas persist over exactly what councils can or should do.
Government guidance is clear that local authorities have no statutory duty to investigate the education children are receiving at home on a routine basis.
It says that parents are not legally obliged to cooperate with requests from councils for information.
The guidance tells councils not to confuse home education with truancy.
But it acknowledges that if councils are concerned then they might impose the sort of school attendance order sent to the Sotellos.

Verstappen was 0.380secs off Rosberg's pace, with Ricciardo just 0.025secs further adrift after recovering from a spin during which he brushed the wall without major damage.
Verstappen was running a Renault engine upgrade which will not be available to Ricciardo until Saturday and which team boss Christian Horner said was expected to be worth in the region of 0.1secs a lap.
And on race pace, Red Bull appeared to have an advantage but the picture was not completely clear.

However a council planning and policy consultation stated the development ""cannot be supported in policy terms"".
A spokesman for Park of Keir Partners said they would discuss the report with Stirling Council planning officers.
Murray, mother of tennis star Andy, and golfer Montgomerie announced plans for the facility, Scotland's first purpose-built golf and tennis centre, last summer.
The proposed facility would include six indoor and six outdoor tennis courts, a nine-hole golf course with a practice range, coaching suites and a cafe, along with around 100 houses and a hotel.
However, some local residents raised concerns about the development being sited on green belt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan.
These concerns were echoed in an official planning and policy document authored by Claire Milne, a principal planning officer at Stirling Council.
Her report concluded that the planned housing - included in the project to subsidise the cost of the sports facilities - ""is not intended to meet any of the local or particular housing needs, and will in fact exacerbate affordability in the local area"".
While the tennis, golf and tourism element of the proposal would ""provide a degree of social as well as economic benefit to the local area"", the report noted that the business case submitted was ""not sufficiently convincing"".
The report also states that there is no ""overriding national need"" or a local need for the project to be sited on green belt land, a ""sensitive landscape"" which would suffer a ""significant detrimental impact"" from the development.

Official statistics also showed that household consumption expenditure boosted the quarterly growth numbers.
But economist Shane Oliver told the BBC the numbers were ""well below potential"".
On an annual basis the economy expanded 2.3%, beating expectations for 2.1%.
Economic growth in the March quarter of 2014 was 2.9%.
""The March quarter GDP [gross domestic product] growth was far better than feared just a few days ago,"" said Mr Oliver, who is chief economist with AMP Capital in Sydney.
""However, Australia is still not out of the woods, as annual growth at 2.3% is well below potential, and a full 0.8% percentage points of the 0.9% growth came from higher inventories and trade.""
He said domestic demand remained ""very weak with consumer spending and home construction only just offsetting the ongoing slump in mining investment"".
""So the Australian economy has not crashed - as many had feared would happen after the end of the mining boom - but it is continuing to grow at a sub par pace,"" he added.
Australia's economy has been adjusting to a post mining-boom landscape. It saw its economy grow 0.5% in the October to December 2014 period from the quarter before, when growth was 0.4%.
On Tuesday, the country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), did not cut its lending rates further to help boost the economy, despite pressure from businesses to do so.
The decision saw Australian stocks fall 1.72% as investors saw little hope of a further cut in the near future.
However, Evan Lucas from IG Markets in Melbourne said ""the collapse of [Australian stocks] on the back of the RBA not having an explicit easing bias... was a bit of an overreaction"".
In May, the RBA cut its benchmark lending rate by 25 basis points to an all-time low of 2%.
Rising property prices in Australia's biggest city, Sydney, a strong currency and a drop in iron ore prices were among the reasons for the cut.
The May rate cut was the second this year, following a previous 25 basis point cut in February and followed similar action from central banks in China, Canada, Singapore, Korea and India.
A rising Australian dollar had also been cause for concern, particularly for Australia's big mining and energy exporters.
Mr Oliver said more help would likely to be required ""in the form of an even lower Australian dollar - and to ensure this happens the RBA may yet still have to cut interest rates further into record low territory.""","Australia's economy grew at a better-than-expected 0.9% in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the previous quarter, boosted by mining together with financial and insurance services.",32970412,"Sure!

""There was a bit of co-operation for maybe five kilometres and then Emma and Elisa started attacking.""
But the chasing pack, including Vos, battled back and caught them shortly before the 1km-to-go Flamme Rouge to set up the sprint finish.
She added: ""In the final kilometres I could tell [the peloton] were coming back.
""Coming into the final kilometre there were a couple of turns with up-hill flickers and again Emma and Elisa were attacking, so it was just about covering them.
""As the group from behind pulled, I tried to put myself in a good position but got caught out a little bit on the last corner.""

100,101,"The Education Policy Institute think tank has produced a league table of academy trusts and councils in England.
David Laws, former schools minister and the institute's chairman, said successive governments had been ""in denial"" about failing academies.
The Local Government Association said it showed academies were no ""magic bullet"" for improving schools.
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Our ambition remains for all schools to become academies.""
Mr Laws said that when he served as education minister in the coalition government there had been internal data showing weaknesses in academy trusts, but there had been a reluctance to publish such information when ministers were promoting academy expansion.
But the Education Policy Institute has now published its own rankings showing how local authorities compare with multi-academy trusts with at least five schools.
The findings show that academy trusts are among the most and least successful at improving pupil performance, at both primary and secondary level.
In between is a spread of success and underachievement, with the analysis concluding that there is little overall difference between academy trusts and local authorities.
The average for academy trusts and local authorities is described as ""almost identical"".
Mr Laws says that it shows it would have been ""rash and dangerous"" to press ahead with forcing all schools to become academies, as it would have meant that some high-achieving local authorities could have been put into lower-achieving academy trusts.
The former education minister said that for successive governments there had been a ""lack of political will to show that some academies are not doing well"".
Mr Laws, a former Liberal Democrat MP, said that a ""lot of political capital has been invested"" in presenting academies as the way to raise school standards.
Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has had to abandon plans to force all schools to become academies, but Mr Laws says their political protection went back to the early days of the first academies created by Labour governments.
Mr Laws said that they were seen by the government as ""a small and precious flower that people wanted to stamp on"".
The comparisons produced by the think tank are based on how much pupils have improved, rather than exam results, as a way of measuring the effectiveness of local authorities and academy trusts.
Many academies operate as stand-alone schools, so these are not included in the rankings, which compare multi-academy trusts.
Mr Laws said that the findings highlighted the need to find ways to scrutinise and improve weak academy chains - but that did not mean that the principle of academies, with greater autonomy, was flawed.
But he suggested that it showed successful local authorities should be able to set up their own academy trusts, rather than have schools taken away from them.
Report author Jon Andrews also highlighted other factors, such as regional differences. Schools in London are higher performers - and he says that both local authorities and academy trusts are likely to do better if they have schools in the capital.
The Sutton Trust education charity has also published a report warning that too many academy trusts are not providing a good enough education for disadvantaged pupils.
It says that one in five academy chains is ""performing substantially below the national average for attainment and improvement"" for children from poorer families.
Lizzie Rowe, chief operating officer of the Education Fellowship, the lowest rated primary academy trust, said that trusts needed to be given time to make progress and that this was not always shown in immediate results.
""Data enables you to judge the pace and direction of a journey - data is not the journey. Some political powers forget this.
""Our strategy is very sound in developing leadership and enabling teachers to deliver outstanding lessons.
""Some of the most successful academies started well over a decade ago and were given millions of pounds to get established. We are a new trust working within an area of neglect and deprivation by all political bodies.""
She said: ""We receive no support from our regional schools commissioner, only negative challenge.""
Roy Perry, chairman of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said: ""Councils have long been highlighting the fact that school structures are not a magic bullet to improve education, and what really matters is outstanding teaching and strong leadership.
""Every school and every community is different, and head teachers need the freedom to choose, in partnership with parents and councils, the structure that is most appropriate for them.""
A Department for Education spokesman said: ""These reports highlight many impressive multi-academy trusts that are driving up standards and delivering an excellent education to thousands of children across the country.
""They are playing a vital and increasingly important role in the school system - thanks to their ability to share resources, expertise and provide support to schools that are struggling.
""Our ambition remains for all schools to become academies with more schools joining multi-academy trusts - our evidence shows this is the best way to bring about sustained improvement.""

101,102,"The 78-year-old ex-Scotland international says several of his old team-mates are affected.
He believes it is as the result of heading heavy footballs in the 1950s and '60s.
""People of our era, the balls we played with were big, heavy things,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.
""To lift them up to take a throw-in you'd have to do special training, and the conditions we played in - snow, rain and mud - and we trained with these things as well, every day, heading practice as well.
""Whether this problem of dementia hastens the end of your life or not I don't know, I'm not a medical person - but what I am saying is these were my pals, these were the guys I played with and they have got these problems.""
St John believes football as an industry should help ex-pros with care costs and said: ""If someone needs special care as a result of their career and their career was football, then football should pay for that.""
The Football Association said it was committed to supporting research into degenerative brain disease among former players.
St John's former Liverpool team-mate Geoff Strong, who won the FA Cup in 1965 alongside the Scot, died aged 75 from Alzheimer's in 2013 while last year it was revealed that three members of England's 1966 World Cup squad - Martin Peters, Nobby Stiles and Ray Wilson - have the condition.
Former West Brom striker Jeff Astle died in 2002, aged 59, from brain trauma caused by heading footballs throughout his career.
He was originally diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, but a re-examination of his brain found he had died from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) - a progressive degeneration caused by repeated head trauma.
St John praised the work that Astle's family have done through the Jeff Astle Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of brain injury in all forms of sport.
But he still believes the Professional Footballers' Association and other football authorities can do more to help former players and the families who are caring for them.
""The game is awash with money, absolutely, so you can't turn round and say it's a finance thing,"" said St John, who played 336 times for Liverpool, scoring 95 goals.
Last year, the FA said it wanted world governing body Fifa to investigate whether former players have dementia as a consequence of playing the game and added that it took concerns about concussion and head injuries ""extremely seriously"".
""In 2015 we established an expert panel which led to the publication of the FA concussion guidelines,"" it said.
""The expert panel further agreed that research is particularly required into the issue of whether degenerative brain disease is more common in ex-footballers.
""The FA is determined to support this research and we have recently agreed with the PFA to jointly fund and support this research as we believe that a collaborative approach will strengthen the credibility and resource available.""",Former Liverpool striker Ian St John has called on football's leaders to look after former professionals who have dementia and Alzheimer's disease.,38911979,"Sure!

Relations between Russia and the West have been tense since Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014.
Russia's envoy also criticised Nato for a military exercise in the Baltic.
Wednesday's talks in Brussels ran more than 90 minutes over schedule.
""Many allies disagree when Russia tries to portray [the Ukraine conflict] as a civil war,"" Mr Stoltenberg told a new conference.
""This is Russia destabilising eastern Ukraine, providing support for the separatists, munitions, funding, equipment and also command and control.""
He added: ""Nato and Russia have profound and persistent differences. Today's meeting did not change that.""
Mr Stoltenberg said it was important to keep channels of communication open ""to discuss our differences and to reduce the risk of military incidents"".
He also said that the two sides had agreed on the importance of implementing the Minsk peace agreement, which has produced a fragile truce in eastern Ukraine.
Russia's envoy to Nato, Alexander Grushko, said a US guided-missile destroyer had sailed near the Russian port of Kaliningrad last week in an attempt ""to exercise military pressure on Russia"".
""We will take all necessary measures, precautions to compensate these attempts to use military force,"" he said.

103,104,"Sir Christopher Pitchford, the inquiry's chairman, said he recognised the public interest in proceedings being ""as open as possible"".
The senior judge said he would assess each anonymity request individually.
The Metropolitan Police has already asked for large parts of the investigation to be in private.
Campaigners who say they were wronged during operations dating back decades are calling for maximum disclosure.
They include women who did not realise their partners were undercover officers, and a long list of social justice campaigners who are trying to establish whether they were unfairly monitored.
The preliminary ruling means that there will be no blanket restrictions on material relating to undercover operations being disclosed if Sir Christopher rules the public interest lies in disclosing them.
Some 33 individuals, nine of them former undercover police officers, have already asked for anonymity.
Scotland Yard, backed by the government, has also argued it should not be forced to admit to the existence of some operations.
Undercover Inquiry: Why it matters - what's at stake?
Deceived women: Who has received an apology from the police?
In an 85-page ruling, Sir Christopher says that the inquiry will have to grapple with seemingly ""irreconcilable"" arguments over whether the public interest lies in keeping sensitive police information secret and protecting the true identities of former undercover officers - or in disclosing past events because of public concerns.
""The starting point is that no restriction order will be made, in the public interest of openness in the Inquiry and its proceedings, unless it is necessary in the countervailing public interest of the protection of individuals from harm and/or effective policing,"" says the ruling.
""It is not possible to state at the level of principle or generality where the public interest balance will rest.
""The Chairman will approach evaluation on a case-by-case basis according to the nature and quality of evidence received in support of the application.""
One woman who was deceived into an undercover relationship, known only as ""Lisa"", said she was not optimistic that the ruling would lead to the truth coming out - saying she feared the inquiry had failed to recognise there was a duty to reveal the truth to people who had been victims.
""I'm glad that they have not been allowed to have blanket anonymity,"" she told the BBC.
""But my biggest fear is that the police will be able to drag this out.
""They won't give up a single piece of information without applying for restriction orders.
""It took four-and-a-half years for me to get an apology in my case.""
The ruling stresses that police officers who want to remain anonymous will have to provide evidence of the possible harm they could be exposed to, if named in public.
This would have to include evidence about the nature or gravity of the risk an individual would face and complex arguments about whether naming someone would breach their human rights.
Similarly, forces will have to show how disclosure of operational details would cause damage to undercover policing.
The Metropolitan Police, backed by other police chiefs and government, had argued that it should be allowed simply to ""neither confirm nor deny"" details of operations.
Sir Christopher must now start assessing the 33 current applications for publicity restrictions and whether any of them need to be backed up by further evidence.
In June, Sir Christopher will also begin considering if the state must be forced to tell parents of dead children that their child's identity was used to create fake personas for undercover officers.",Undercover police officers facing claims of wrongdoing will not automatically get anonymity at a forthcoming major public inquiry.,36196745,"Sure!

105,106,"The Real Madrid forward got the decisive goal when he stooped low to head in Miguel Veloso's superb cross.
Up until then they were frustrated by a disciplined Sweden side, who went close through Johan Elmander, Sebastian Larsson and Kim Kallstrom.
No player has scored more headed goals (four) than Ronaldo in European World Cup 2014 qualification
The second leg will take place at Solna's Friends Arena on Tuesday.
That promises to be another fascinating contest between two sides, with the impetus now on Sweden to attack, having set their stall out to defend for long periods during the first leg.
They did, however, create the better chances in the opening 45 minutes despite Portugal enjoying 67% of the possession.
With Paris St-Germain forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic given special attention by Portugal's defence, his attack-minded team-mates found themselves with more space than they should have been afforded.
Norwich's on-loan forward Elmander was first to cause nerves in the home support when he stretched to send Mikael Lustig's right-wing cross inches past the post.
Erik Hamren's men then created two great chances in the space of two minutes. Sunderland's Larsson surged forward from midfield to strike a low shot that Rui Patricio dived to his left to divert, before Kallstrom, winning his 107th cap, smashed an 18-yard free-kick that brushed Portugal's upright.
Ibrahimovic failed to register a single touch in the opposite box against Portugal
The home side's best chance of the half came in the first five minutes when Ronaldo and Raul Meireles combined before feeding Joao Moutinho, who drifted round keeper Andreas Isaksson before firing into the side-netting.
Portugal's frustrations continued after the break as Sweden sat deeper, while their coach Paulo Bento probably would have been left exasperated by some of the awful attempted deliveries into the area.
But with eight minutes left one cross led to something greater when Dynamo Kiev's Veloso's fantastic delivery found Ronaldo, who threw himself at the ball to give Portugal the lead.
Moments later, the Real Madrid marksman almost scored his 30th of the season, but saw his header bounce back off the crossbar.
Sweden offered little as an attacking threat after the break, with Ibrahimovic failing to trouble Patricio and his defence. The skipper will have to show the sort of form he has produced for Paris St-Germain this season on Tuesday if Sweden are to stand a chance of going to Brazil.
""We would have been very happy with a draw,"" Sweden coach Erik Hamren said.
""We played a good game defensively - the goal was unnecessary, we were careless with that cross.""
Bento added: ""We created a great early chance and Sweden hit back. But in the second half it was one way for us.
""It was an important step to reach the World Cup but not yet decisive.""

Built by the Swansea Canal Navigation Company between 1794 and 1798, the canal runs 16.5 miles (26.5km) from Swansea to Hen Neuadd in Powys.
But since 1958, parts have been abandoned, sold off and filled in.
""It could take many, many years - decades - before we can see the first boats go down the full length of canal because there's so much work to be done,"" said Joe Coggins, from Glandwr Cymru, the canal and river trust in Wales.
""These are small building blocks and the work being carried out this week is part of the wider project.""
The canal was built primarily to carry coal down to Swansea Docks with the main cargos of coal, iron and steel making the enterprise profitable.
The canal was sold to the Great Western Railway in 1873 and it continued to make a profit until 1895.
A period of decline followed with commercial traffic ceasing in 1931 but horse-towed maintenance boats continued until 1958.
Parts of the canal were then abandoned, sold off and filled in.
Glandwr Cymru inherited a central section of the canal, approximately five miles between Clydach and Ynysmeudwy.
The five locks in it are not navigable with gates removed but weirs are used to ensure water supply to Mond Nickel works at Clydach.
The canal is now popular among towpath users and the Swansea Canal Society is doing the restoration.
Swansea Canal Society and the Waterway Recovery Group are doing the work along the canal, supported by Glandwr Cymru.

The sale went ahead despite protests from the Mongolian president.
Elbegdorj Tsakhia says the skeleton, unearthed in the Gobi Desert, came from Mongolia and that exporting fossils found in the country is illegal.
The auctioneers, Heritage Auctions, say the specimen was imported legally. A restraining court order in the name of the Mongolian leader was put on the sale.
Tyrannosaurus bataar is an Asian cousin of the meat-eating Tyrannosaurus rex.
The skeleton in New York is thought to be one of the most complete and well preserved ever discovered, says the BBC's Jonathan Blake in Washington.

117,118,"Next was found to have used a tax avoidance scheme called a rate-booster.
The court ruled Next diverted UK profits to foreign subsidiaries to claim tax relief on overseas profits.
Such schemes are a way in which firms avoid corporation tax on foreign profits that are then paid back to the UK parent firm.
Under rules designed to prevent double taxation of company profits, firms were able to claim credit for tax paid on money they made overseas.
But some companies were able to exploit the rules through the creation of artificial arrangements involving what HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) referred to as ""complex circular movements of money between companies in the same group, so they can claim there has been double taxation"".
Known as rate-booster schemes, this enabled companies to avoid corporation tax by diverting profits made in the UK to foreign subsidiaries.
The foreign subsidiary then paid tax on those profits - often at a lower rate of corporation tax - before the profits were paid back to the UK parent company.
Finally, the UK parent company received credits from HMRC for the tax already paid by its subsidiary.
As a result, companies were able to claim far more tax had been paid on their overseas profits than was actually the case.
Legal changes in 2005 and 2009 mean rate-booster schemes are no longer possible or attractive, HMRC added.
The Next case is the second to reach court, following a 2013 ruling against P&O Ferries, although the firm appealed against the decision and an appeal judgement is outstanding.
HMRC said about £130m in tax was at stake across 20 rate-booster cases, which were awaiting the P&O and Next decisions.
About 70 rate-boosters have already been conceded by companies that wanted to avoid going to court. This has brought in more than £500m in tax, it added.
HMRC's director general of business tax, Jim Harra, said: ""This case shows how HMRC takes effective action against big businesses that try to avoid paying tax through convoluted, artificial avoidance schemes. HMRC expects all businesses to steer well clear of such schemes.""
In a statement, Next said it had paid the tax owed to HMRC ""some years ago"" and that this had been fully accounted for at the time.

With New Zealand's World Rugby player of the year Dan Carter kicking six goals and organising the demolition, Wales international Owens believes Racing will be hard to beat.

""They are the best team in Europe.
""Saracens in England are up there, playing very good stuff. But I think Racing, with the squad they've got, the calibre of player and the different variations in their game, have the edge.""
Racing beat Scarlets 29-12 in Llanelli in November, before World Cup winner Carter made his debut for the French club.

120,121,"Some Australian states already have ""no jab, no play"" laws, but PM Malcolm Turnbull is calling for nationwide legislation.
Health groups have supported the push, arguing parents and the community have an obligation to protect children.
An Australian Child Health Poll survey of nearly 2,000 parents showed 5% of children were not fully vaccinated.
Mr Turnbull said more needed to be done, citing the case of a baby who died from whooping cough.
""This is not a theoretical exercise - this is life and death,"" Mr Turnbull said.
""If a parent says, 'I'm not going to vaccinate my child,' they are not simply putting their child at risk, they are putting everybody else's children at risk too.""
Vaccinating children is not a legal requirement in Australia, but failing to do so makes parents ineligible for childcare rebates.
Three Australian states - Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria - already require children to be immunised, or be on an approved catch-up programme, to enrol in childcare centres.
Australian Medical Association president Michael Gannon said children were more susceptible to infections.
""If you, as a parent, expect the community to support you by either welfare payments or access to care, then you need to do your bit to contribute to that community by protecting other children,"" he told Fairfax Media.
The so-called ""anti-vax"" movement believes vaccinations may cause medical conditions such as autism, but overwhelming scientific research suggests this is not the case.
Vaccines can cause adverse reactions in a small number of people, like many medicines, but the accepted science is that the benefits far outweigh the risks.
Widespread vaccination also reduces the risk of infection to those who, for medical reasons, may not be able to receive the vaccine themselves.
So-called ""herd immunity"" is an important part of public health programmes. It stops the spread of disease by preventing an infection from moving among most people - the ones who have been vaccinated. And so it protects those few without the vaccine.
But as the numbers of those without protection rises, so to does the risk to each of them - something which happened alongside the first death from measles in the United States in 12 years.",Unvaccinated children would be banned from childcare centres and preschools under an Australian government plan.,39251585,"Sure!

Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel was third and is three points behind Hamilton.
It is a crucial milestone for Hamilton as F1 next heads to Singapore, where Ferrari are expected to dominate.
The victory was Hamilton's sixth of the season - Vettel has only four - and it capped a perfect weekend for him.
He scored a brilliant pole in treacherous wet conditions on Saturday - more than a second clear of the next fastest driver - to take his tally to 69, one more than Ferrari legend Michael Schumacher.
Hamilton's victory was among the most straightforward of the season. He fought off a brief challenge from Williams driver Lance Stroll, a remarkable second on the grid, on the run down to the first corner and disappeared into a race of his own.
""The team did an amazing job. Valtteri did a great job. Mercedes power is better than Ferrari power so that's one thing,"" Hamilton said, as he was booed by the Tifosi during the podium interviews.
The fight was all behind him, as Bottas and the Ferrari drivers set about fighting up from their unusually low grid positions.
The Finn, who started sixth, was up to fourth on the first lap behind Hamilton, Force India's Esteban Ocon, another star of qualifying, and Stroll, who dropped a place in a tussle at the first corner.
Bottas got Stroll into Turn One on lap three, Ocon in the same place a lap later, to give Mercedes total control of the race, which they never surrendered.
Vettel limited the damage to his title hopes as much as was possible in the circumstances, passing team-mate Kimi Raikkonen around the outside into the first Lesmo on lap three, Stroll a couple of laps later before picking off Ocon into Turn One on lap eight.
The German, though, was no match for the Mercedes at Ferrari's home race - generally dropping at least half a second a lap - and his focus in the second part of the race became holding off Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo.
The Australian, who qualified third but started 16th after being given a grid penalty for using too many engine parts this season, put in a brilliant recovery from his lowly grid position.
He picked his way through the slower cars in the first part of the race, pulling off a series of his trademark aggressive overtaking moves, and ran a long first stint to give himself fresher tyres for the final stint than the Ferraris ahead of him.
Ricciardo dived brilliantly inside Raikkonen from a long way back at the first chicane with 12 laps to go and began to set off after Vettel, who was just over 11 seconds ahead.
Initially, he began to close at a second a lap, but as the edge went from his tyres, his advantage reduced and Vettel crossed the line four seconds ahead.
Vettel later told his team over the radio that he had gone off track at one point and felt ""something was wrong"" afterwards, explaining part of his lack of pace.
""My start was not so good - I had quite a lot of wheel spin and we didn't quite have the pace of the leading two cars but seeing the people and having that support was amazing,"" Vettel said afterwards.
""We have a very strong car and will have a very strong end of the season.""
Ricciardo's team-mate Max Verstappen got up from 13th on the grid - also victim of a penalty after qualifying second in the wet - to be eighth on the first lap.
But he wrecked his race by tangling with Williams driver Felipe Massa on the second lap, damaging his front wing and getting a puncture and rejoined last.
Verstappen recovered to 10th place, incurring the anger of Haas' Kevin Magnussen, from whom he stole the final point, when he moved over on him while overtaking the Dane at the second chicane and forced him on to the grass.
Stroll and Ocon inevitably slipped back behind faster cars from their superb starting positions, earned with starring drives in the wet.

""[Mr Cameron] is actually very keen to say 'there is a limit, there's an amount of time a prime minister should serve before they get stale,' and he is right about that.""
Mr Cameron has tipped Home Secretary Theresa May, Chancellor George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson as potential successors.
But Mr Duncan Smith said that, having been Conservative leader at a time when the party ""was quite interested in having a fight in an empty room"", he would not make predictions.
He said he expected the next Conservative leader would already have been ""in the public sphere for some time"".
Following Sunday's interview, a Downing Street source told the BBC: ""David is very clear he will serve a full five-year second term, every single day of that as prime minister.
""In terms of what happens in five years' time, we'll sort that out in five years' time.""

127,128,"The chain says it will commit to paying 28p per litre for 100% of its liquid milk throughout its entire range.
It is less than the 30-32p farmers estimate it costs to produce each litre but the farming union welcomed it.
Asda's announcement comes after protests by dairy farmers at branches of Asda, Morrisons, Lidl and Aldi over the price they are paid for their milk.
The National Farmers' Union (NFU) said it was pleased Asda had recognised the ""plight of the dairy industry"" in its ""hour of need"".
The industry says a reduction in global demand for milk has led to an over-supply in the UK, creating difficult conditions for many dairy farmers.
Asda said it would increase the price it paid per litre to its milk supplier Arla from Monday, with the intention that it be passed directly on to farmers.
""Asda's origins are in dairy farming which is why we are acting in the best interests of our farmers and our customers by increasing the price we pay, introducing the Farmer's Marque label and not passing on any of the costs to customers - our retail price stays the same,"" he said.
It is not yet clear whether Arla, Britain's biggest milk co-operative, will pass on the increase in price to farmers.
Meurig Raymond, NFU president, urged Arla to ensure it passed the extra payment on ""with immediate effect"".
Asda previously announced a price cut of 0.8p per litre - taking the standard litre price to 23.01p for its UK members.
On Tuesday, Morrisons said it was launching a new milk brand which will see 10p per litre extra paid to farmers.
The Milk for Farmers brand, to be launched in October, means a four pint bottle (2.27 litres), which now sells for 89p, will cost an extra 23p.
The four main farming unions - the NFU, the NFU Cymru, NFU Scotland and the Ulster Farmers Union - held an emergency summit on Monday to develop an action plan to tackle falling milk, lamb and arable prices.
There have been days of protests by farmers including milk trolley challenges, blockades at distribution centres and even bringing cattle into supermarkets.
The average price paid to dairy farmers for milk across the UK is 23.66p - following a drop of 25% in a year.
The NFU said that currently Waitrose, Marks & Spencer, Tesco, Sainsbury's and the Co-op have arrangements where a farmer is paid a price above the cost of production for milk. Asda, Lidl and Aldi currently do not offer such deals to farmers.

128,129,"Having arrived at Adams Park with Super League honours and international recognition behind him, injury and personal issues brought a premature end to Smith's big move to the Premiership.
However, after returning to Leeds and then Wakefield in Super League, he accepted a second crack at union with Newcastle Falcons earlier this season.
Why would a player with a vast collection of honours in league go through the rigours of switching codes for a second time when so many others have struggled to adapt? Smith is clear.
Sam Burgess's move to Bath from Australian NRL side South Sydney in 2015 is much anticipated, with his ball-carrying, defensive work and offloading skills all appealing to the 15-man game.
There remains some doubt about where Burgess will be employed, as he can play anywhere across the back-row in league, but like Andy Farrell - another code-switcher - he could find himself in the centres.
However, Smith is concerned that trying to mould Burgess could take away some of his natural talent.
""I went on a show with Brian Moore when I made my debut against Leicester and I said anyone can be a success (in union) if they get the right coaching, and play to their strengths,"" Smith said.
""Don't try to change a player into something they're not. They need to use a player's strengths and work with it.""
""If I got into my 40s and 50s looking back on my career without having a proper go at it I'd have been disappointed with myself,"" he told BBC Sport.
""Obviously I had a go with Wasps and it didn't work out, but I'm very fortunate that Newcastle came in and wanted to sign me.""
Rugby league has been a useful talent pool for union clubs since the advent of professionalism in the late 1990s reversed a trend of players moving the other way for financial and sporting rewards.
Whereas once it was union stars such as Jonathan Davies, Scott Quinnell, Kel Coslett, Billy Boston and Tom van Vollenhoven who moved into the 13-man game, now it is Sam Burgess, Kyle Eastmond and Joel Tomkins  who have brought their skills into union.
Not everyone can make the same impact in both codes, as countless stars including Henry Paul, Lesley Vainikolo and Shontayne Hape can testify.
""I had a great time in rugby league, but there's only a certain type of player that can move codes,"" said Smith.
""They're two totally different games. All the rucking and mauling compared to the play-the-ball is completely different.
""Moves are similar, but it's different game plans. The fitness has to be different. You need to be intense for one or two minutes in union and then you get a break, while league is a bit more continuous. That's something else I'm going to have to work on during the off season.""
While Smith's rugby league career brought him Super League Grand Final winners' medals, and a Harry Sunderland Trophy for man of the match in the 2008 final, the move to Newcastle has seen him experience the opposite end of the scale.
Falcons feared potential relegation from the top flight until the penultimate game of the current campaign and have a big summer ahead to ensure improvement is made next season.
""I think the culture has to be player-driven, the coaches can only give you so much,"" Smith said.
""I've been about a long time and seen a lot of things,"" Smith said.
""But I still class myself as young, and the more you hang about with the younger lads it keeps you young.
""Keith Senior used to be like that, he'd hang around with all the young lads and still thought he was 19 like us lot.
""It keeps you young but I've got experience. I've got little things I learned in rugby league that I can bring through to Newcastle and I'm trying to do that in little ways.
""During the off-season I will probably have more to time to spend with the coaches and bring my knowledge of that game to mix in with the rugby union stuff.""
""Going back, Leeds had lots of very good professionals. I got brought up by people like Kevin Sinfield, Jamie Peacock, Danny McGuire and Rob Burrow - they were very good pros and it filtered down into the academy.
""That's how you were brought up, if you stepped out of line then you got knocked back into line. That's somewhere where maybe at the Falcons we can tighten up a bit in the off-season.
""We need to set our standards ourselves, so when we get beat we can ask ourselves questions why and take a bit of responsibility off the coaches.""
With nearly 200 games for club and country across the two codes on his curriculum vitae, Smith has grown from young gun to seasoned pro.
The aim now for the Morley-born three-quarter is to establish a regular place at Kingston Park, once the Falcons have completed their 2013-14 campaign with the visit of Exeter.
""It's a bit frustrating going in and out, but you've got to look at the bigger picture,"" Smith continued.
""I'm getting my first summer holiday for something like 13, 14 years which will be brilliant. I'll go away and spend some time with the family and then we're back in mid-June.
""I've got two and a half months then before the Premiership season starts, where that is my real learning curve.
""That's when, in September, I want to be hitting the ground running, starting in the team and nailing down a position where I'm going to play and playing week in, week out.""",It would have been easy for Lee Smith to turn his back on rugby union after a stint with Wasps in 2009 ended after only five months.,27325857,"Sure!

130,131,"The Bulls' fate has been in the balance since the full extent of their financial worries emerged in the weeks since their dramatic final-day escape sent Chester down instead.
Chester have been reinstated as a Conference Premier club and Hayes & Yeading will stay in Conference South.
""Hereford United can have no complaints. The Conference bent over backwards to help them.
""I described the news of the board's offer of an extension on Friday evening as not so much 'last chance saloon', but rather 'last orders in last chance saloon' and United have seemingly chosen not to offer the league the assurances they were seeking.
""It is a desperately sad day for all Hereford supporters, but the Bulls have nobody to blame but themselves.
""You have to feel very sorry for those players who gave their all at Aldershot on the last day of the season to keep Hereford in the Conference Premier. Sadly, those efforts now count for nothing.""
The Conference had originally offered a payment deadline of Thursday, 5 June.
The club's debt to their football creditors, including former boss Martin Foyle, members of the current squad, other club staff and clubs from whom the Bulls loaned players during the 2013-14 season, added up to £148,000.
That deadline was extended three times, to Friday, 6 June, then again to Saturday, 7 June and for a third time until Thursday, 12 June.
But it became clear on Tuesday that the Bulls, taken over last week by London businessman Tommy Agombar, would not make that deadline - and the Conference has now acted.
The last team to be expelled from the Conference was Chester City in February 2010.
They reformed as Chester FC two months later - and it is now they who have taken the Bulls' place, following a dramatic final day of the season when, almost simultaneously, a late Hereford winning goal at Aldershot and a Salisbury equaliser at Chester kept the Bulls up.
By way of an added twist, Chester announced on Tuesday that Kingsley James, who was in Hereford's team that day, has moved to Bumpers Lane.
26 April - Hereford stay up on final day of Conference Premier season
29 April - Hereford United Supporters' Trust make offer to buy the club for £1 and clear their £220,000 debts
22 May -  Former Bulls boss Martin Foyle serves winding-up petition over unpaid wages, after players reveal they have not been fully paid too
2 June - Case adjourned for 28 days at Royal Court of Justice
3 June - Tommy Agombar takes over as new Hereford owner
5 June - Hereford fail to meet 17:00 BST deadline to pay football creditors, and are threatened with expulsion, subject to Conference board vote
6 June - Hereford meet with Conference board and are given new deadline of 7 June. The deadline is moved to 9 June, then 12 June
10 June - Hereford expelled from Football Conference
And former Hereford boss Foyle, now manager at Southport, chose the same day to sign another player from that same Bulls team, keeper Dan Lloyd-Weston, who opted to leave as he was still owed part of his salary.
When last season ended, despite months of fundraising efforts by fans, as well as generous donations from fans of other clubs, the Bulls faced debts of approximately £225,000.
They still owe over £70,000 to clear the latest PAYE tax demand from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).
An offer was made by one of the club's main fan bodies, the Hereford United Supporters' Trust (HUST), on the back of pledges made by their backers, to buy the club for £1 and take over the running at Edgar Street.
But, although chairman David Keyte held talks with them, they were not the preferred option.
Keyte was reported to have been in talks with three different rival bidders before Agombar's takeover.
The downward spiral of Hereford's financial situation since being relegated from the Football League in May 2012 has been exacerbated by falling gates.

He said he found plenty of bugs that could be exploited by hackers.
But he said most ISPs had been in contact with him and had worked to tighten security once told of the issues.
The audit of TalkTalk, Sky, BT, Plusnet, EE and Virgin Media was kicked off in the wake of the TalkTalk hack, which saw the personal details of 157,000 of its customers exposed.
More than 15,600 bank account number and sort codes were stolen.
Similar problems to those encountered by TalkTalk could have been experienced by any of the major ISPs, Mr Moore believes.
""There have been a couple of incidents where I had to contact ISPs to report things that were serious,"" he told the BBC.
The audit found a variety of problems, including passwords stored in plain text, exposed code that would allow hackers to inject their own code on to ISPs' websites and, potentially load malware on to them, and issues with encryption certificates that meant Mr Moore could apply for them from the certificate authority and pose as the webmaster for a set of ISP-owned websites.
Mr Moore said he was impressed by most of the ISPs's responses when he raised the issues with them.
""Ordinarily they would not be so open and honest with me but, after what happened at TalkTalk, they have been stepping in quickly,"" said Mr Moore.
""On one occasion I notified BT and PlusNet about a bug at 14:00 and they kept people back until 22:00 to fix it.""
But, he added, TalkTalk was yet to contact him.
TalkTalk did supply a statement to the BBC saying it had ""integrated Paul Moore's comments into an ongoing programme of work"".
""We constantly run vulnerability checks using industry-standard third party tools. The vulnerability exploited by the hackers was not picked up by this testing, and if it had been, we would clearly have acted on that information straightaway to secure our system,"" it added.

Leeds, who slip to third from bottom with just one win from their first six league fixtures, rarely threatened.
Town held on to go four points clear thanks to a fifth win from six.
On-loan Manchester City midfielder Mooy was not certain to play after a hectic international break which saw him appear in both of Australia's World Cup qualifiers.
But he dictated the play as the Terriers had the better of a dull first half in which neither side could muster a shot on target.
Mooy, who was booked late in the first period for a nasty-looking lunge that infuriated Leeds manager Garry Monk and his coaching staff, came closest with a decent low strike.
But his second attempt on goal 10 minutes after the restart proved much more successful and was reward for the visitors' urgency and superior quality.
Chris Wood sent a header wide for Leeds before the break and could have snatched a barely deserved point late on, but failed to properly connect with another headed opportunity.
Leeds head coach Gary Monk:

A United Airlines statement said: 'We have regretfully taken this decision because of the route's poor financial performance.""
The ruling by the European Commission to block the funding package to protect Northern Ireland's one and only scheduled trans-Atlantic service defies logic and is an example of ""abysmal Brussels decision-making"".

""The executive did the right thing with its bid to save this key route. There was a risk to the flight and we stepped in to save it. Faced with the same circumstances again, I would make the same decisions. All public money has been recouped with interest and we retained the route for a longer period.
""Our decision to support the route was praised by many and, had we not have made an effort to save the United flight, we would have been rightly criticised.
""We were always aware of the potential of an issue around state aid compliance, but given the tight timescale to put a package of support in place, approval by the European Commission could not be sought in advance of agreeing a deal with United.""
""This is an international embarrassment.
""This is a huge blow to our international standing and the minister must tell us what he intends to do to sort it out.""
""Awarding a £9m subsidy for a global corporation, which makes billions every year, against the advice of senior civil service officials and against state aid rules, was a dangerous commitment of resources at a time of already stretched budgets.
""The gamble taken by the executive has spectacularly crash landed and there are now very serious questions for the economy minister to answer.
""We need to know what communication the minister had with the European Commission before and after he issued a ministerial direction, ignoring the advice of senior civil servants.
""Additionally, Simon Hamilton must outline how much public money has been spent advertising the route since the direction was issued.""
Alliance MLA Stewart Dickson said the decision by United Airlines to halt its Belfast to Newark route is a serious blow to Northern Ireland, in economic and social terms.

""We now learn that the funding was blocked by the EU Commission and I am calling on the Executive to explain what discussions were held with the Commission before the announcement, which was made with great fanfare. Is this another case of the Executive seeking good news headlines without adequate preparation? Did they even bother to check if this funding could break EU rules?

It is the second month in a row the state has exceeded emergency conservation regulation.
California has been dealing with record low water levels for four years.
California Governor Jerry Brown imposed the state's first mandatory water restrictions four months ago, ordering a 25% reduction in all towns and cities.
In June, the state used 27% less water than it used in the same period of 2013, when the drought emergency was first declared.
This saving rose to 31.3% in July, with a cumulative saving for both months of 29.5%, the State Water Resources Control Board reported on Thursday.
Felicia Marcus, who chairs the board, praised the ""millions of conscientious Californians"" who she described as ""the real heroes here"".

Pulis managed the Potters for 464 matches over two spells and comes up against his old side with them bottom of the early Premier League table.
But the Welshman - who has also managed Crystal Palace in the Premier League - expects current Stoke boss Mark Hughes to steer his side away from trouble.
""You couldn't have scripted it better to be honest, the fact that I'm going back to Stoke,"" Pulis said.
""It's fantastic. Whichever way the result goes, my 1,000th game will be at Stoke and I had great times there.
""Everything changes so quickly. A couple of games and Stoke could be two-thirds of the way up the table. What you've got to do, and I don't have to tell Mark how to manage, is to keep your feet on the ground. Keep looking ahead, keep pointing ahead and hope that things change.
""They have a very strong squad there and it's a surprise that they are down at the bottom. I'm sure they will get out of it - I just hope that it's not on Saturday that they start.""
Pulis first took charge of Bournemouth in the third tier of English football in August 1992, as the first Premier League season got under way.
His big signing that summer was striker Steve Fletcher for £30,000. This summer he broke West Brom's transfer record to spend £13m on Nacer Chadli.

The survey indicates that only 11% of of the chamber's members in Northern Ireland support a British exit (Brexit).
That compares to 30% of those surveyed in the rest of the UK.
The Chamber of Commerce has about 1,200 members in Northern Ireland.
About 250 of those responded to the poll.
More than half of the respondents (60%) said that Prime Minister David Cameron's renegotiated EU deal is unlikely to change how they will vote.
The results come on the eve of crunch Brussels talks, which are expected to result in a deal.
Eighty-four per cent of those surveyed in Northern Ireland  also say that there has been no impact on their sales and orders as of yet, due to the uncertainty of Britain's future within the EU.
Commenting on the results, President of Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce Stephen McCully said the findings suggest that ""the renegotiation is having little impact on day-to-day business - or the vote of the business community"".
He said that this was because many made up their minds before knowing the outcome of negotiations, effectively discounting them as irrelevant.

147,148,"Many in the list have been found down old mine tunnels or on slag heaps where water and even fire have had the opportunity to work up novel compounds.
It is another example, the researchers argue, of our pervasive influence on the planet.
New minerals and mineral-like compounds are now being formed faster than at anytime in Earth's history, they say.
""These 200 minerals are roughly 4% of the total known minerals, but they all occurred in the last couple of thousand years, most in the last couple of hundred years,"" explained Robert Hazen from the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington DC.
""That's an incredible rapid spike in the rise of mineral species unmatched in the history of our planet,"" he told BBC News.
The only period that bears comparison is the time when oxygen became abundant over the surface of the Earth just over two billion years ago. But that event would have played out over millions of years.
Minerals are specific combinations of chemical elements arranged into crystalline structures. Earth's rocks are built from different aggregations.
The likes of feldspar, quartz and mica will be known by most people. But bobcookite, calclacite, or elyite are obscure, to say the least.
Their existence is down to humans creating a setting where chemical reactions can take place between materials that might otherwise not have come into contact.
In addition to mines, which seem to be a particularly productive environment, the new minerals have been found to occur inside smelters, old geothermal piping, on the surfaces of archaeological artefacts, even inside museum specimen drawers.
The 208 man-mediated minerals are listed by Prof Hazen and colleagues in a paper just published by the American Mineralogist.
They have all been approved by the International Mineralogical Association. This organisation operates some quite tight definitions on the sorts of compounds that can appear among the 5,200 entries in the official catalogue. And the group that does not make the grade is the huge number of mineral-like materials that have been manufactured by humans for a specific purpose.
""Human synthesise thousands and thousands of materials - semi-conductors, and laser crystals, and magnets, and batteries, and building stone,"" said Prof Hazen.  ""These have mineral-like materials that will persist in the geological record for the next billion years.""
It is further evidence, if more were needed, that Earth has now entered a new epoch.
Currently, geologists label the time since the last ice age, 11,700 years ago, as the Holocene. But there is a push to introduce a new classification to reflect the immense, planet-wide changes driven by humans in recent decades - and for it to be called the Anthropocene Epoch.
The list of new man-mediated minerals bolsters the case.
Co-worker Marcus Origlieri from the University of Arizona commented: ""In the sediment layers left behind from our age, future mineralogists will find plentiful building materials such as bricks, cinder blocks, and cement, metal alloys such as steel, titanium, and aluminium, along with many lethal radioactive byproducts of the nuclear age. They might also marvel at some beautiful manufactured gemstones, like cubic zirconia, moissanite, synthetic rubies, and many others.""
And Edward Grew from the University of Maine added: ""These minerals and mineral-like compounds will be preserved in the geological record as a distinctive, globally distributed horizon of crystalline novelty - a persistent marker that marks our age as different from all that came before.""
Colin Waters, from the British Geological Survey, is secretary to the Anthropocene Working Group, which is the body trying to draw up detailed criteria to define the proposed new epoch.
He echoed the statements of Prof Hazen's team. The great changes occurring on Planet Earth were being reflected in the mineralogical record, just as they were in the chemistry of the atmosphere and the oceans, he said.
And Dr Waters highlighted the ball-point pen as an example.
""The ball at the end is made from tungsten carbide. Billions of them have been produced since the 1950s. Imagine how much of that material is knocking around the planet.
""We're ingenious at creating new mineral-like materials for our own purpose, and it is actually these that will be the voluminous signature of our presence on the planet, rather than some fairly obscure mineral that develops in a mine as a result of our excavation and then later alteration.""
Prof Hazen's team is part of the Deep Carbon Observatory, an international network of nearly 1000 multi-disciplinary scientists committed to investigating the quantities, movements, forms, and origins of carbon in deep Earth.

""There was still room to improve - Ashton missed an opportunity in the corner, Tuilagi forced the ball - but this team today gelled. They got opportunities and took them - to me that's what Test match rugby is about.
""It's very easy to look back at the past but England's 31-28 win against the All Blacks in 2002 was the day we actually said 'we are the top team in the world'. It was a massive transformation from which England then built for the next few years.

151,152,"The petition calls on the EU and its member states to stop the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP.
It also says they should not ratify a similar deal that has already been done between the EU and Canada.
It says some aspects pose a threat to democracy and the rule of law.
One of the concerns mentioned in the petition is the idea of tribunals that foreign investors would be able to use in some circumstances to sue governments.
There is a great deal of controversy over exactly what this system, known as Investor State Dispute Settlement, would enable companies to do, but campaigners see it as an opportunity for international business to get compensation for government policy changes that adversely affect them.
This kind of provision exists in many bilateral trade and investment agreements.
Friends of the Earth have published new research on the impact they have had on EU countries.
Information about these cases is not always made public, but the group says that going back to 1994, foreign investors have sought compensation of almost €30bn (£24bn) from 20 states. Where the results are known (a small minority of the total), the tribunals have awarded total compensation of €3.5bn (about £2.8bn).
In Britain, the possible implications of this provision for the National Health Service have been especially controversial.  Campaigners believe that the investor tribunals would make it harder to reverse any decisions to contract services out to international healthcare firms.
John Hilary of War on Want said:  TTIP  ""will make it impossible for any future government to repeal the Health & Social Care Act and bring the NHS back into public hands"".
The petition lists a number of other areas where its signatories believes European standards would suffer if the TTIP negotiations are completed and the Canada deal is ratified:  employment, social, environmental, privacy and consumer protection.
The European Commission says the EU will not have to sacrifice its high standards. It also says investor protection provisions are important for investment flows and have in general worked well. But it accepts there is a need for improvement and is trying to achieve that in its bilateral negotiations.
The petition has been organised as an exercise called a European Citizens' Initiative which can lead to a public hearing in the European Parliament and require the European Commission to give a formal response explaining why it is accepting or rejecting what the petitioners call for.
The European Commission has already said that the petition doesn't qualify as such an Initiative.

His statement comes despite last week's heavy fighting in the city of Malakal.
Mr Machar, who first fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo, is now being treated in Johannesburg.
In July, Mr Machar's bodyguards and President Salva Kiir's presidential guards fought each other, sparking days of violence.
Hundreds of people died and more than 100,000 fled across the border.
The fighting erupted less than a year after a peace deal was signed to form a unity government and end the civil war.
Riek Machar profiled
Speaking to the BBC's HARDtalk programme, Mr Machar said: ""I'm going to return to South Sudan.""
""Because President Salva Kiir doesn't want democratic and transparent and fair elections to be conducted, he attacked us, he has restarted the war.
""But I am hoping that wise leaders in the region, and in Africa, and the rest of the world will throw up a political process which will bring about peace again, and the resuscitation of the peace agreement, and the reconstitution of the transitional government of national unity.""
Mr Machar also denied that claims that he was a warmonger, saying that his troops were simply defending themselves against government attacks.

155,156,"Jayden Stockley headed wide from Jonny Hayes' cross early in the second half and Rangers quickly capitalised on that miss when Kenny Miller tucked in.
A powerful Lee Hodson shot doubled the home side's advantage.
The hosts' Clint Hill and Aberdeen's Ryan Jack were each dismissed for two bookings, with Andrew Considine heading a late consolation for the Dons.
The Ibrox side had started the day level on points with Hearts but trailing them on goal difference.
However, with Hearts held to a draw by Ross County, Mark Warburton's side go two points ahead of the Tynecastle side and remain eight behind leaders Celtic.
Rangers had lost at Hearts in midweek while Aberdeen were coming off a 3-0 defeat by Celtic in Sunday's League Cup final, with the Dons aiming to end a 25-year wait for a win at Ibrox.
But that run continues with Warburton's side winning by the same scoreline that they lost by at Aberdeen's Pittodrie in September.
The visitors had their chances in Glasgow with James Maddison - who scored a stunning free-kick winner in the sides' last meeting - seeing a set-piece effort bounce wide.
Stockley got a foot to a Graeme Shinnie cross to draw a save from Wes Foderingham and came close to putting Derek McInnes' side ahead three minutes after the break.
Hayes got round his man to cross from the left but Stockley could not direct his header from six yards on target.
Maddison failed to get a hold of a couple of shots before Rangers' second but the midfielder did deliver the free-kick for Considine's goal.
Captain Lee Wallace fired wide in the hosts' best first-half advance and it was the composure of Miller that finally broke the deadlock.
Moments after Stockley's miss, 36-year-old striker Miller, deployed in midfield, latched on to Joe Garner's speculative cross and finished first time.
Barrie McKay had the vision to find Hodson inside the box amid a spell of pressure and the Northern Ireland international lashed a shot into the roof of the net for Rangers' second, having started ahead of regular right-back James Tavernier.
McKay's replacement Harry Forrester forced a save from Joe Lewis as the pressure continued.
Defender Hill had earlier escaped unpunished following a risky challenge on Shinnie inside his own box but bookings for fouls on Maddison resulted in the 38-year-old's dismissal.
Jack, 24, followed Hill up the tunnel after being cautioned in the wake of a lengthy spell of pushing following a Rangers foul, the Dons skipper having earlier been booked for impeding Michael O'Halloran.
And there were further bookings in stoppage time to take the tally to 11.
Rangers' Mark Warburton: ""The players were more than irked by comments made about them, by comments questioning their battling qualities and their desire.
""But they responded really well, there was a lot of nonsense written about them and they more than answered those questions.
""First half nobody really controlled the game, it was pretty neutral. But, second half, we stepped on and won second balls and I felt we deserved to win.""
Aberdeen's Derek McInnes: ""From penalty box to penalty box I thought we were the better team.
""We really got after Rangers, we pressed them high, we were competitive, we were winning tackles, we were fully committed. I thought we really frustrated them.
""But we said to the players at half-time, it was important in the final third to carry more of a threat ourselves,. We got in good areas and rushed that last wee bit.
""We had more opportunities to apply pressure with the ball rather than just without the ball, and Rangers scored when we were having our best spell.
""We started the second half really on the front foot, got into good areas, still should be doing more with it, but Jayden's is clearly the one we all remember.
""It was a good stand-up from Jonny and Jayden would normally eat that type of service up, but he misses. It happens but unfortunately for us it was pivotal.""

The Daily Mail said the ex-Monty Python member had become ""rueful - even, in the true sense of the word, pathetic"".
The Alimony Tour - so-called because Cleese says it is funding a divorce - opened in Cambridge on Tuesday.
Comedy website Chortle said Cleese was ""pleading penury"" and had been ""forced out on the road to scrape together a living when he'd rather be at home with a good book"".
As such, it continued, there was ""a slight feeling that with the flagrantly money-making Alimony Tour that he's done just enough to get by"".

Yet The Times' Dominic Maxwell argued there were too many such clips, and ""too little of Cleese developing intriguing ideas about craft"".

159,160,"Ansar al-Sharia demanded the authorities release Islamist fighters from jail in exchange for the soldiers' safe return.
The announcement came only days after a series of suicide attacks and armed assaults by the group in southern Yemen left more than 100 people dead, most of them soldiers.
It had previously warned that it was going to launch a series of attacks on the authorities, dubbed the ""Flooding River"".
Ansar al-Sharia, whose name means ""Partisans of Islamic law"" in Arabic, was formed by AQAP in response to the growing youth movement in Yemen, which has marginalised Salafi-jihadists who advocate the violent overthrow of the government and the establishment of an Islamic state.
Mass, peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations have swept the Arab world in the past year, not least in Yemen, where they eventually forced President Ali Abdullah Saleh to hand over power to his deputy in November.
Last April, jihadist websites published an interview with AQAP's religious leader, Adel al-Abbab - also known as Abu al-Zubair - who said that Ansar al-Sharia had been set up to attract people to Sharia rule in the areas under the control of AQAP and allied groups, including ""Islamic"" punishments.
In the past year, militants linked to AQAP have seized parts of the southern province of Abyan, including the provincial capital, Zinjibar.
Ansar al-Sharia says it provides public services to locals in such areas and claims to solve their day-to-day problems.
It says it is reproducing the model of Sharia rule espoused by the Taliban in Afghanistan and the Islamic State of Iraq, a militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda in Iraq.
Adel al-Abbab said Ansar al-Sharia had successfully attracted locals and tribesmen in some areas by turning their strategy ""into popular action, instead of keeping it as an elite one"".
Many of those involved in Ansar al-Sharia are jihadists who have experienced living in an ""Islamic state"", either in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, or among jihadists in Iraq after the US-led invasion in 2003.

The committee had considered plans - backed by deputy Leader Tom Watson - to reinstate elections to the shadow cabinet. Since 2011, the party leader has selected his own top team.
Mr Watson said the proposal could help Labour ""put the band back together"" for a possible early election.
A proposal  to decide on the details of the plan ahead of Saturday's leadership election result was voted down, by 16 votes to 15.
Mr Corbyn was among those to vote against it, but did agree to further talks with Mr Watson and other senior figures before the next NEC meeting this weekend, at the party's conference in Liverpool.
Mr Watson said afterwards that it was a ""very positive meeting"".
He added: ""We agreed 22 changes to our rules and guidance, all sorts of positive things I'm sure the media will be really interested in.""
Many MPs see elections as a way of constraining Mr Corbyn, should he be re-elected as leader, and ensuring a balance of opinion at Labour's top table.
Supporters of Mr Corbyn say any plan should call for party members and activists to also have a say in any elections.
The Labour leader has said there is a ""thirst for democracy"" in the party and he backs a ""widening of the franchise"".
Mr Watson also called for Labour's leadership election rules to be changed to exclude registered supporters who pay a one-off fee to vote.
He described their participation as ""unpopular"" and suggested a return to a franchise of party members, trade unionists and MPs.
In last year's contest, 84% of the 105,598 registered supporters who paid Â£3 to vote backed Jeremy Corbyn.
This time around, they were asked to pay Â£25 to take part.
Despite the increased fee, 129,000 people are thought to have applied successfully for a one-off vote in the contest between Mr Corbyn and his challenger Owen Smith - the result of which will be announced on Saturday.
Registered supporters were given a say in the choice of leader as a result of changes brought in by Ed Miliband, and approved by the party in 2013, designed to open up the process to a wider audience.
Critics have said it allowed the leadership election to be hijacked by far-left groups with their own agenda - although Mr Corbyn easily won the most support among all groups - including party members, trade unionists and other affiliated supporters.
Mr Watson, who himself was elected deputy leader last year using the same franchise, said the reforms had been ""rushed"" and ""unpopular"".
He suggested a return to the previous system used to elect Mr Miliband and his predecessors - in which voting was limited to an electoral college of party members, trade unionists, affiliate supporters and elected representatives of the party.
""We created a new category of member - a registered supporter - that was pretty unpopular in all sections. We want to remove that and we want also want to enfranchise ordinary trade unionists in the process,"" he said.
Mr Watson said he did not want the changes to be seen as a threat to Mr Corbyn and suggested they would only apply after he stood down, whenever that may be.
But the BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move would be seen as an attempt to make it much harder for a left winger like Mr Corbyn to be elected.

Addresses in Birmingham and London have also been searched.
Dyfed-Powys Police said the search in Carmarthenshire concluded on Thursday.
A force spokeswoman said: ""The Wales Extremism and Counter Terrorism Unit, supported by officers of Dyfed-Powys Police, have today provided assistance to The Metropolitan Police, following yesterday's incident in London.
""In doing this, they have conducted a search of one property in Carmarthenshire - this search has concluded.
""The occupants are receiving appropriate support. They are not suspects and have not been arrested.""
There is no threat to the area, the force added, having earlier said it was ""increasing patrols"".
On Thursday evening, the Met confirmed a 75-year-old man was the fifth person to die in the wake of the attack.
The force said eight arrests have been made in the capital and in Birmingham - three women and five men - with searches at addresses in Brighton and south east London having now concluded.
Earlier, police formally identified the man believed to have been responsible for the Westminster attack as Masood, a 52-year-old from Kent who was born Adrian Elms and who was thought to have most recently been living in the West Midlands.
Police said Masood was not the subject of any existing investigations and there was ""no prior intelligence about his intent to mount a terrorist attack"".
However, he was known to police and had a range of previous convictions for assaults, including causing grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offences.
South Wales Police and Gwent Police said they were reviewing their respective security arrangements in light of the incident and there would be an increase in police presence in busy areas.
North Wales Police has asked people to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious.

""Will people come dressed as Star Wars characters? I'd be really disappointed if they don't,"" said Proms director David Pickard.
He went on to praise the musician's ""wonderful, varied"" scores.
However Williams will not be able to attend the concert, as his age prevents him from taking trans-Atlantic flights.
This was a contributing factor in the London Symphony Orchestra losing the opportunity to land the next generation of Star Wars films.
The John Williams tribute is one of almost concerts that will take place as part of the 123rd Proms this summer.
To mark Hull's year as the City of Culture, the festival will leave London for the first time since the 1930s with a performance of Handel's Water Music at a new outdoor ampitheatre overlooking the River Hull and the Humber estuary.
Back in London, Europe's only BAME orchestra, Chineke!, will make their Proms debut.
The brainchild of double-bassist Chi-chi Nwanoku, the ensemble was only founded in 2015, making it one of the youngest groups ever to play the festival.
""It would normally be common for an orchestra to be in existence for five or six years before they appear,"" said Pickard.
But he said it was ""very important to mark"" the ""significance of Chineke! and what they are doing,"" in showcasing the talent of under-represented performers.
The orchestra will debut a new work by British-Caribbean composer Hannah Kendall, The Spark Catchers, accompanied by BBC Young Musician winner Sheku Kanneh-Mason - who will receive his A-Level results shortly before the concert, on 30 August.
Other highlights in this year's programme include:

Notably, the 2017 season has nothing as populist as last year's Strictly Prom, or previous years' diversions into grime and dance music.
""I don't want the Proms to be something that repeats things for the sake of repeating them,"" said Pickard, adding he wanted to ""find new ways of getting new audiences"".
""And things like the John Williams prom will hopefully do the same thing that a Doctor Who Prom might do, which is to bring in an audience that might be drawn in by the films they've seen, but will hear music they love played by an orchestra.""
2017 marks 90 years since the BBC took over running and financing the Proms, and 70 years since the famous Last Night was broadcast on television.
It has commissioned 30 new works, 13 of which are by female composers, while three female conductors will make their first Proms appearance.
Although he admitted there was still work to be done, Pickard said the diversity of this year's performers and composers wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago.
""The Proms is a leader in classical music and people look to us for the things we're doing,"" he said. ""And whilst we can't bear that responsibility alone, I think it's incredibly important we take the lead.""
All of this year's concerts will be broadcast on BBC Radio 3, and more than 20 will be filmed for television or iPlayer. The BBC is also experimenting with lossless audio - by streaming the season in CD quality via the BBC Proms website.

But he also will be associated deeply with Togo, who gave him his first coaching job - and he pulled off a remarkable achievement to qualify them for the 2006 World Cup finals, ahead of Senegal and Zambia.
However, he was sacked by Togo just a few months before the tournament in Germany.
Keshi returned for two more spells  - appointed in 2007 and 2001 - but was unable to repeat his earlier success with the Hawks.

Police allege that on 8 March after a news conference in Florida, he grabbed her arm when she tried to ask Mr Trump a question, leaving a bruise.
Mr Lewandowski plans to plead not guilty, the Trump campaign said.
Police in Jupiter, Florida, where he was arrested, have released new footage of the alleged assault.
The security video appears to show him trying to pull Ms Fields out of the way as she walks alongside Mr Trump and tries to speak to him.
""Mr Lewandowksi is absolutely innocent of this charge,"" the Trump statement said. ""He is completely confident that he will be exonerated.""
Mr Trump himself has defended Mr Lewandowski on Twitter, saying the police footage shows there was ""nothing there"".
If Donald Trump is going to win the Republican nomination without a convention fight, he will have to endure yet another string of political blows that would stagger even the strongest campaign.
A week before a key primary in Wisconsin, Scott Walker - the state's governor - gave a full-throated endorsement of rival Ted Cruz. Now Mr Lewandowski has been charged over his manhandling of a female reporter during a rally. This comes after a particularly tawdry few days in the Republican presidential battle as Mr Trump and Mr Cruz engaged in a war of words over their spouses.
The New York property developer has been able to maintain his front-runner status for months despite countless controversies and conflagrations. This time may be different, however.
Recent events are likely to cause further damage to Mr Trump's already poor standing with female voters. The Republican presidential pack has been whittled to just three candidates, with the not-Trump vote consolidating behind Mr Cruz.
Mr Trump's path to securing the Republican nomination is a narrow one, so the slightest stumble could deny him the prize outright. Then it's on to the convention, where party loyalists and a growing cadre of Cruz-friendly activists hold sway.
The charge comes during a difficult time for Mr Trump, just ahead of next week's Wisconsin primary where he is neck-and-neck with Senator Ted Cruz.
Earlier on Tuesday, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker endorsed Mr Cruz for president.
Mr Trump will participate in a CNN town hall event on Tuesday night when all three Republican contenders will face questions.
He is currently well ahead in the Republican race with 739 delegates to Cruz's 465.
Ohio Governor John Kasich is some way behind with 143, with the 1,237 needed to win the nomination probably out of his reach.

It comes after Mr Carswell said in an article in the Times on Saturday that Mr Farage ""needs to take a break now"".
A bitter internal row has developed within UKIP after Mr Farage's resignation was rejected by the party.
Mr Carswell said: ""I'm suggesting he takes a break as leader. I'm not suggesting he takes a break from being leader.
""Clearly the national executive has the authority, they're the ruling body.
""I'm told that they made a decision. I'm told it was a procedurally correct decision, he is the leader but I think it's important that as leader he takes a break and I think it's important that we work out how these complex questions are answered by a team.
""No one person has all the answers. I'm particularly concerned about tone, making sure we get a tone that ensures that the 27 million people who didn't vote for UKIP last week may be persuaded to vote for us in future.""
The party has been beset by wrangling since Mr Farage agreed to stay on as leader, days after standing down after failing to get elected in Thanet South.
He had pledged before the general election that he would quit the post if he failed to get elected to Parliament.
Senior aide Matthew Richardson has left the party, following claims from MEP Patrick O'Flynn that Mr Farage had fallen under the influence of ""inexperienced"" advisers.
UKIP has also confirmed the departure of Mr Farage's chief of staff Raheem Kassam.
Mr Farage ruled out quitting as leader on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, saying he had ""phenomenal"" support, and has challenged his critics to decide whether they want to stay in the party.
In his article, Mr Carswell had said that ""knowing how difficult it is to lead a party makes me admire Nigel Farage all the more"".

""Winning that last game against Hong Kong was pretty crucial for us,"" batsman Coetzer told BBC Scotland.
""Coming away with that against our name was hugely important.""
That eight-wicket triumph took its time too - 21 attempts over 18 years - and the 32-year-old thinks more fixtures against higher-ranking teams like Afghanistan are vital if they are to continue building on that hard-fought success.
""The schedule is very bare at the moment and, if you are trying to produce players to compete against the top 12 nations in the world, that's going to be very hard to do if you're not playing any cricket,"" said Coetzer.
Scotland and Afghanistan met during the World T20 in Nagpur in March, when this week's visitors secured a 14-run victory along with qualification from the group stages, where they also beat the eventual winners West Indies.
But Coetzer believes the Scots are coming at this series, being played at The Grange in Edinburgh on Monday and Wednesday, with the strongest squad they have probably ever had.
""We've got some options with the bat and some more options with the ball now, so it's really given us a more rounded squad,"" said the vice-captain.
And, after that win over Hong Kong the team, led by Preston Mommsen, will be ""quietly confident"" they can put pressure on the visitors in what he thinks will be a ""tightly contested"" series.
With the temperature in Afghanistan hitting the mid-30s, Coetzer believes there could be an advantage against the team ranked 10th in the world.
""At training, they all turned up well wrapped up as it's only 13 degrees and I guess that's not what they're used to,"" he said.
""The pitch conditions too, the wicket may well suit our players and hopefully things like that will go in our favour - you've got to make your home ground a fortress wherever that is and that's The Grange at the minute.""
Someone who has a heads-up on the disappointment of a Scottish summer is Lalchand Rajput - the former India and Scotland international who has taken charge of Afghanistan for their tour of Scotland, Ireland and the Netherlands.
The 54-year-old from Mumbai spent 10 seasons with Perthshire and another five with Strathmore and may know a thing or two about July temperatures here.
While Rajput has been quoted as calling Scotland his second home, that fondness will be swept aside as he takes the reins for the first time against the Scots, although Coetzer claims they are not expecting any massive surprises.
Having tasted success on the world stage this year, Scotland are hoping to use that to build excitement around the sport nationally.
That is perhaps hindered somewhat by the fact they do not play again until 14 and 16 August against the United Arab Emirates in Aberdeen.

The policemen were found guilty of staging a pre-arranged extrajudicial killing known as a fake encounter.
Encounters are partly a response to India's slow and dysfunctional criminal justice system, correspondents say.
Police often see cases evaporate as trials are delayed and witnesses turn hostile.
The latest high-profile case to come to court dates back 25 years ago to when a group of Sikh families, including children, was travelling by bus through the state Uttar Pradesh in northern India after visiting holy sites.
Police officers stopped the bus in Pilibhit and forced some of the men to get out.
Later, joined by more policemen, they divided the Sikh men into groups, led them into the jungle and shot them dead.
Why India's 'fake encounters' are shockingly common
Afterwards, police lied about what happened. They claimed that the men were militants and armed - at the time, there had been a spate of attacks in the region by Sikh groups fighting for a separate homeland.
The Central Bureau for Investigation (CBI) said that the motive for the killings was to earn awards and recognition for killing ""terrorists"", NDTV reported.
The court in sentencing the men said that police officers who were holding important posts must be behind the killings , but the CBI had kept them away from the investigation, The Indian Express reported,
The court said that the CBI officer investigating the case was not fully free to take decisions relating to it without constantly referring to his senior officers and that several people who should have been accused were instead set free or not charged.

Part of her job was to make sure people who had committed ""significant crimes"" but were living in the community, complied with Crown Court orders issued under the Mental Health Act.
Ms Doherty said visits had happened every six weeks but council mental health services manager Andrew Cole, giving evidence on the first of a two-day hearing, said the visits were less frequent.

178,179,"Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) figures show medics spent 32,000 hours waiting at A&E departments in 2015-16 compared with 16,000 in 2014-15.
YAS said waiting time ""was one of the most significant issues"" it faced.
A shortage of available hospital beds has been given as one of the problems causing knock-on delays at A&E.
Dr David Macklin, Executive Director of Operations at YAS, said handover waiting times were ""a system problem"" for the NHS, not just in Yorkshire, and said blame could not be attached to individual hospitals.
""We have numerous occasions where we have multiple vehicles queued at hospitals,"" he said.
""Emergency departments across Yorkshire are working incredibly hard to manage their demand and that means sometimes ambulances are queuing.
""Patients who are not seriously injured may need to wait.""
Professor Keith Willett from NHS England said the increase in waiting times was ""concerning"" and added there were ""a multitude of reasons"" for the rise.
""One of the biggest problems is the pressure on the beds in the hospital,"" he said.
""That's because the hospitals are finding it increasingly difficult to move patients and their care back into the community.""
The figures were supplied after a Freedom of Information request by the BBC.
Just five hospitals - one each in East, South and West Yorkshire and two in North Yorkshire - accounted for about 70% of the total waiting time.
The handover time is counted only after 15 minutes have elapsed at A&E.

179,180,"Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show 3.7 million workers travel for two hours or longer every weekday.
Frances O'Grady of the Trades Union Congress, which published the figures, called on employers to do more to prevent ""excessive"" journeys.
The average daily commute lasted 57.1 minutes in 2015, the ONS data showed.
Ms O'Grady blamed stagnant wages for bulging commuting times, paired with high house prices and rental costs.
""Employers cannot turn a blind eye to this problem,"" she said. ""Long commutes eat into our family time and can be bad for our working lives too.""
Back in 2010, 2.8 million people made daily commutes of two hours or more, compared with 3.7 million today, according to the ONS's Labour Force Survey.
The survey, which is based on responses from nearly 90,000 workers and excludes those who work from home, found that:
The TUC said workers were now less likely to be able to afford to live near their places of work.
The cost of renting a home in the UK rose faster than the cost of living in the year to September, according to ONS figures.
Meanwhile, UK property prices saw an 8.4% annual increase up to August.
Longer periods travelling to and from work have therefore become an accepted part of many people's daily routine.
""It makes life difficult but it's become the norm,"" said Nick Seymour, a solicitor from Exeter, who spends at least three hours a day travelling by car and train to and from Bristol.
Once a week, he also travels to his firm's office in Cardiff - a four-hour-plus round-trip.
""I've been doing this for months and am surprised how many people do the same route,"" he said.
Mr Seymour, 43, said the Â£5,000 cost of train tickets, not including petrol and parking, was worth it to avoid the upheaval of relocating.
""I am considering moving, but my wife and son are based here in Exeter,"" he said.
The compromise is missing out on eight-year-old son Harry's parents' evenings and school plays - not to mention delays and crowded trains.
""It can be a daily nightmare,"" he said. ""I normally stand because it's too busy, which is frustrating if you've had a long day.""
Other commuters are going to great lengths to avoid overcrowded or delayed trains.
Phil Cresswell, who works in media advertising, cycles 230 miles a week on his daily journey from Leatherhead in Surrey to central London.
He says spending his ""14th winter"" on the bicycle is worth it to save ""several thousands of pounds a year"" on train tickets as well as the cost of a gym membership.
""I live on the edge of the Surrey hills and it's great for cycling,"" he said.
Mr Cresswell, 51, admits that some people think the 46-mile round trip is extreme.
""But I think sitting on trains or buses for similar times going nowhere is extreme,"" he said.
Another unconventional commuter is Sam Cookney, who recently packed in his own five-and-a-half-hour round trip between Barcelona and London.
In a blog post in 2013, he explained that flying from Barcelona for four days a week was cheaper than renting a flat in the capital.
Mr Cookney, 33, moved to Barcelona last year but decided making the trip four times a week would be ""excessive"", and instead travelled to London a few times a month.

180,181,"The Project Loon team, part of the company’s X research lab, said it was now able to use machine learning to predict weather systems.
It means the firm has far greater control over where its balloons go, making it possible to focus on a specific region, rather than circumnavigating the globe.
Clustering a small number of balloons greatly reduces the cost of the idea, Google’s “captain of moonshots”, Astro Teller, told reporters.
""We can now run an experiment and try to give service in a particular place in the world with ten, twenty or thirty balloons,” he said, rather than the hundreds needed previously.
“Real users” will be able to use the system in the “coming months”, he added - but he did not specify where the initial roll out would take place.
Rural ambition
Google’s aim is to provide connectivity to the around four billion people in the world who do not have access to the internet, particularly those in difficult-to-reach rural areas.
Rather than undertake huge construction projects to replicate connectivity networks in the developed world, the firm has instead experimented with beaming down connectivity from a network of huge, tennis-court sized balloons.
The balloons float in the stratosphere around 11 miles high. By raising or lowering altitude, the balloons can be caught in different weather streams, changing direction.
By using machine-learning algorithms, Google thinks it has cracked a way to predict weather with enough accuracy to make it possible to hover balloons over a relatively small area for a long period of time.
Last last year the firm was able to keep a cluster of balloons over Peru for three months.
Spin off
Over the past year Google has come under increasing pressure from its shareholders to rein in the costs of its more outlandish ideas.
Last month, the firm has spun off its self-driving project into a new company - Waymo - and has stepped up attempts to commercialise the technology amid criticism it was taking too long to make money from its work.
Mr Teller said Project Loon was one of the more “mature” moonshot ideas at the company, but while it was entering into contracts with telecoms firms, Google was in “no rush” to make Project Loon a stand-alone business.
“The service has a much better chance of being profitable which is obviously exciting for us,” he said.
""Things have gone much better than we anticipated they could go. That has made the prospects of Loon even better than we had anticipated.”
Falling out of the sky
One key hurdle for the company to overcome is the reliability of its balloons. To date, the record for continuous balloon flight has been 190 days.
At a research lab within Google’s campus in Mountain View, California, development teams painstakingly analyse each failed balloons on a huge scanner nicknamed “Billie Jean” owning to light panels reminiscent of the illuminating pavement in Michael Jackson’s iconic music video.
Other technologies trying to achieve similar goals have been tested by Google and others. The company recently shut down Project Titan, an effort to use solar-powered drones to deliver connectivity to a wide area. The programme was cancelled owing to economic and technology difficulties, the company said.
Facebook has attempted to work with similar technology. It’s Project Aquila drone, which is being developed in the UK, suffered a major setback when one of its craft crashed last June.
On the challenge facing Project Loon, Mr Teller admitted that many at the company did not think it would ever actually work.
“If we’d known how hard it was going to be, we probably never would have tried,” he wrote in a blog post published on Thursday.

Barker, 22, won the women's 25km points race having previously claimed two silver medals in Hong Kong.
British Cycling have admitted it had not paid ""sufficient care and attention"" to riders' wellbeing.
""It's about time they had good press about all the good work they do,"" Barker told BBC Radio Wales Sport.
An investigation into the culture at British Cycling was launched last year after ex-riders complained about their treatment.
In March, British Cycling apologised for any ""failings"" in its performance programme and promised to be more caring to riders following accusations of sexism and bullying.
But Wales' Barker, who won silver medals in the madison and scratch races at the championships, said she could not have achieved her success in Hong Kong without the support of British Cycling.

186,187,"The network will comprise at least 600 spacecraft in the first instance, but could eventually encompass more than 2,000.
The aim is to deliver broadband links from orbit to every corner of the globe.
In particular, the project wants every school to have a connection.
Building so large a constellation requires a step-change in the manufacture of satellites - especially for Airbus.
It can take Europe’s biggest space company many months and hundreds of millions of dollars to build some of today’s specialist platforms. But for the OneWeb venture, it is all about high volume and low cost.
That means new assembly line methods akin to those in factories producing cars and planes.
The idea is to turn out three units per shift at well less than a million dollars a piece.
The boss of Airbus, Tom Enders, concedes he initially thought the OneWeb concept to be fantasy.
""Everything in space as you know traditionally has been 'gold-plated'; it had to work perfectly, [and have] the most expensive materials, etc.
""Here, we’ve had to go other ways, to be really commercial and calculating according to the target cost because that is very decisive in the whole business case for OneWeb,"" he told BBC News.
Airbus and OneWeb have inaugurated the first assembly line in Toulouse, France. Two further lines will be set up in a soon-to-open factory complex in Florida.
The most obvious difference you notice between these new lines and the conventional satellite cleanroom is the trolley robot, which moves the developing satellites between the various work stations. But the ""revolution"" here goes far beyond automation; it requires a whole chain of suppliers and their components to scale their work to a different game plan.
The first 10 satellites to come off the Toulouse assembly line have a deadline to launch in April next year.
Another batch will follow into orbit around November. And then the launch cadence will kick on apace.
The establishment of the OneWeb constellation requires the greatest rocket campaign in the history of spaceflight.
More than 20 Soyuz vehicles have been booked to throw clusters of 32-36 satellites into a web some 1,200km above the Earth.
There should be just under 300 on station by the end of 2020, the start of 2021; more than 600 about a year or so later; and then over 800 by the middle of the decade.
OneWeb and Airbus are not the only companies planning a mega-constellation in the sky. SpaceX, Boeing, ViaSat and others have all sought regulatory approval. But not everyone will succeed in getting the necessary multi-billion-dollar financing, and Airbus believes the OneWeb concept has first-mover advantage.
Equity of $1.7bn has already been raised, and talks are ongoing to secure the loans needed to complete the roll-out. OneWeb describes itself as a ""truly global company"" but it has company registration in the UK's Channel Islands. And, as such, it must deal with the UK Space Agency as the licensing authority.
""A lot of our revenues are going to flow through the UK. So, from an economic perspective, it is going to be very important for the UK,"" said OneWeb CEO Eric Béranger.
""And when you have people locally, you are also fostering an ecosystem. And I think the UK being at the forefront of regulatory thinking on constellations will foster an environment that puts the UK ahead of many countries.""
One aspect that the UKSA is sure to take a keen interest in is debris mitigation. There is considerable concern that a proliferation of multi-satellite networks could lead to large volumes of junk and a cascade of collisions.
The fear is that space could eventually become unusable.
A recent study - sponsored by the European Space Agency and supported by Airbus itself - found that the new constellations would need to de-orbit their old, redundant spacecraft within five years or run the risk of seriously escalating the probability of objects hitting each other.
Brian Holz, who is CEO of the OneWeb/Airbus manufacturing joint venture, said the ambition of his constellation was to set new standards in debris mitigation.
""We can bring down the satellites and re-enter within two years; we've made that commitment,"" he told BBC News.
""We've put extra hardware into the system to improve the reliability of that de-orbit process. We're also committing to put a small adapter device on to each spacecraft that will allow those spacecraft, in the small probability that one of them dies on the way down, to be grabbed by a small chase vehicle and pulled out of orbit.""
Time will tell how disruptive the new manufacturing approaches adopted in Toulouse will be to the satellite industry as a whole.
Airbus and OneWeb hope also to be making satellites for other companies on their assembly lines. But not every platform in the sky will require such volumes and a good number of spacecraft will still need the bespoke treatment.
""Not everything here is application to the whole space industry. When we launch to Jupiter, there are things that will remain gold-plated whether we like it or not; unless of course we start to manufacture 900 satellites to go to Jupiter but this is not the case today,” said Nicolas Chamussy, who runs the satellite division of Airbus.

Google can also collect location information from phones, allowing it to work out when a user has seen an ad, and whether they have searched for the product advertised and gone to an offline shop to buy it.
It introduced store visit measurements back in 2014, using the location data on mobiles to track when people visited a store.

It added that Google's ""third-party partnerships"" already capture approximately 70% of credit and debit card transactions in the US, but did not reveal who the partners were or how information was captured.
Google will not have access to the details about what individuals spend - instead they learn the value of all purchases in a certain time period.

""To accomplish this, we developed a new, custom encryption technology that ensures users' data remains private, secure, and anonymous.""
""What's really fascinating to me is that as the companies become increasingly intrusive in terms of their data collection, they also become more secretive,"" Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center told the Washington Post.
The measurement of store sales will be aggregated and anonymised and no location data will be shared with advertisers.
Users can opt out of the service by going to their ads setting page and unchecking the box that says: ""Also use Google Account activity and information to personalise ads on these websites and apps and store that data in your Google Account"".
Users can also disable personalisation for all Google ads. And they can pause or delete their location history.

The Bab al-Aziziya compound includes all three such networks, and it was presumed that their disruption would disorient regime soldiers on the front line, cut off field commanders from Tripoli, and sow confusion in the ranks.
But was the strike also an assassination attempt?
Assassination of a head of state is illegal under international law, and forbidden by various US presidential orders. On the other hand, the targeted killing of those woven into the enemy chain of command is shrouded in legal ambiguity.
Given the personalistic nature of the regime, and the ""all means necessary"" clause in UN Resolution 1973, it might be argued that killing Col Muammar Gaddafi and certain members of his family - such as his son Khamis, commander of an elite military brigade - would be permissible, even if it posed a risk to those non-combatants around the regime.
Legality, though, indicates neither legitimacy nor prudence. This strike, and the death of Saif al-Arab, have produced little military result at the greatest diplomatic and symbolic cost to Nato.
Saif al-Arab was, unlike his brothers, not a senior military commander or propagandist. His death is redolent of the 1986 US strike on the same compound.
That raid killed a girl who Col Gaddafi later claimed was his adopted daughter and, in the scarred buildings and craters, furnished him with a long-lasting symbol of defiance.
The propaganda value of such unintended deaths is potentially severe.
In the 1991 Gulf War, a US stealth bomber directed two bombs at what was claimed to be a command-and-control bunker, but was in fact an Iraqi civilian shelter.
The result was 315 deaths, including 130 children. Col Gaddafi, like Saddam Hussein before him, will take every opportunity to exploit such errors to paint Western powers as indiscriminate aggressors.
Moreover, this is no longer a conventional war in which top-down direction is crucial. Pro-Gaddafi forces in both the besieged western city of Misrata and in the east have adapted to Nato's air power and are using increasingly unorthodox tactics.
They need not rely on a stream of detailed orders from Tripoli, and can cause considerable harm to civilians without this guidance.
Nato is understandably frustrated at the diminishing returns of air strikes, since it has destroyed most accessible targets. But killing commanders and disrupting communications is far less important than the key task of degrading heavy military equipment, such as tanks and artillery.
If the strike had killed Col Gaddafi himself, would it then have been at least a military success?
One of the greatest mistakes of the Iraq war was assuming that, with the departure of Saddam Hussein, the state apparatus could simply be transferred to new ownership.
Col Gaddafi's death could see Saif al-Islam Gaddafi take the reins, galvanise supporters, and continue the war with equal intensity. It would be dangerous and short-sighted to portray even effective assassination as a silver bullet.
Perhaps, though, the demonstration to the regime that no safe haven exists, and that only capitulation would bring security, justified these risks?
There is no doubt that, along with the military aim of disrupting command-and-control hubs, Nato sought a psychological effect, conscious of the possibility of ""accidental assassination"".
The problem is that the direction of this effect is unclear. The dramatic visual impact of this air strike, and the death of those disconnected from political and military leadership, will harden the diplomatic opposition to the war, from Russia and China amongst others.
More consequentially, it will anger the alliance's warier members, like Germany and Turkey, and inflame parts of Arab and African public opinion.
It may eventually leave Britain and France bearing the military burden alone, with modest but limited assistance from a cagey US administration eager to keep at arm's length from this European war.
Col Gaddafi's overarching strategy has never been to win a conventional war, but to induce symbolically prominent casualties, drive a wedge between more committed and more ambivalent members of the coalition, and knock away the pillars of political support on which this intervention was built.
Thus far, the coalition had sought, rightly, to purchase coalition longevity at the price of campaign intensity. If that balance continues to shift towards the latter, Nato runs the risk of playing into the regime's hands.

193,194,"It carries the simple name e-Delicious, and it takes the form of a box about the size of a large printer, containing sensors, and some computer circuitry, which act as an electronic tongue and nose.
It was developed by Thailand's National Innovation Agency, at a total cost of $1m (£640,000), after former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinwatra complained about the poor versions of Thai food she was subjected to during her overseas trips.
A Thai Delicious committee was formed - a bit like the French Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée for food and wine - and around 200 people were invited to sample different versions of classic Thai dishes like tom yum gung (sour prawn soup) and kaeng khiao wan (green curry).
Whichever version was the consensus winner was taken as the standard, although the designers acknowledge that as the sampling was done in Bangkok, inevitably their standards for now are Bangkok versions.
The e-Delicious machine has nine sensors in it to measure the balance of six Thai flavours - sweet, sour, bitter, salty, savoury and spicy - and the food's aroma.
There is also a sensor to assess the dish's visual presentation, which is always very important in Thai cooking.
But can it actually tell you if the dish is any good?
""The machine can't tell you if something is delicious or not,"" says Nakah Thawichawatt, an entrepreneur who carries the grand title of Innovation Ambassador.
""The sensors give a taste-reading that we can understand. So if we like a certain taste, but can't explain what that taste is to someone else, the machine will able to decipher it, and record the data as a standard for other dishes.""
We decided to give the e-Delicious a test. We had seen it sample low-cost versions of the recipes in its database - only three for now, but soon to reach 10 - and found them all wanting.
But how would it cope with the tom yum gung that is judged by many in Bangkok to be the finest in the city?
You won't find it in a ritzy restaurant in Bangkok's upmarket neighbourhoods, where Italian or Japanese cuisine is popular.
Jay Fai, a formidable-looking woman in trademark beanie-hat and fire-engine slash of lipstick, is sometimes called the Mozart of the Wok, for the lightning speed and instinctive flair with which she wields that most essential tool for East Asian cooking.
Her pad kee mao, or drunken noodles, is renowned: thick strips of white rice noodles fried in seconds over a roaring charcoal brazier, the meat, seafood, vegetables and chillies seared, glazed and smoky.
But it is her tom yum gung they queue up for, despite a price tag that reaches $50 (£32) for a large bowl.
Jay Fai tells me she learned her recipes from the old women who used to cook for the community on the village where she grew up.
She is meticulous about ingredients, searching for the very freshest jumbo prawns, the most fragrant herbs - and tom yum gung relies a great deal on the galangal, lemon grass and lime leaves that flavour it, along with the fermented fish sauce, tamarind, lime juice, chillies and red onions.
Watching her hurling great handfuls of herbs into the furiously boiling pot, it is hard to see any precision.
And yet, after a couple of minutes she produces a soup of exquisite, overpowering taste and aroma. Once eaten, never forgotten, and for this reviewer, never equalled.
At the Thai Delicious lab we spooned some of Jay Fai's soup into two glass beakers - one for taste, one for smell - and slid them into the e-Delicious machine.
After a minute's processing, it delivered its verdict; for taste, 90%. For aroma, 100% - the highest score of any tom yum gung it had assessed.
So perhaps a machine can judge great cooking.
For a final view I called the chef at the first Thai restaurant ever to win a Michelin star: David Thompson, a true global culinary celebrity.
His Bangkok restaurant Nahm has repeatedly been voted as one of the world's finest.
""It's an impossible dream, to set one standard,"" he said. ""Taste is so subjective.""
""There are standards, but the art of cooking is the epitome of humanity, with differences in taste, seasoning and technique that express the cook's character.""
And what about a taste robot?
""It's a gimmick, a foolish idea,"" he said. ""Any cook, any sound practitioner or craftsman knows that a robot can never analyse the product of the human hand.""
The developers of the e-Delicious machine are undeterred.
Despite its high cost - at least $18,000 (£11,455) per unit - they hope they can sell a few to each country where Thai food has taken off, to offer at least a consistent standard by which Thai restaurants can come and have their versions of the Thai classics judged.
And if that does not take off, they have also come up with a Thai Delicious app for smartphones.","At a small laboratory in a Bangkok suburb, a group of scientists has come up with what they hope is the answer to an old conundrum: how to tell if a Thai dish is authentic or not.",30110282,"The e-Delicious machine, developed by Thailand's National Innovation Agency, is a device that can assess the taste and aroma of Thai dishes and determine if they meet the standards of classic Thai recipes, but some chefs and experts are skeptical about its ability to accurately judge the subjective experience of taste.",0,"Article: {}

Fury upset Klitschko last November to secure the WBA, IBF and WBO heavyweight titles but was charged by the UK Anti-Doping Agency (Ukad) in June.
A provisional suspension was lifted pending an independent investigation.
Fury, who fights Klitschko at the Manchester Arena, has denied any wrongdoing and threatened to sue Ukad.
Co-promoter Frank Warren said: ""After all the injuries and contractual problems, there is no danger of the fight not happening.""
I'm just waiting for my revenge. I'm obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back.
The road to Fury-Klitschko II has been a rocky one. It was originally scheduled for July before the 28-year-old Englishman turned an ankle in training.
In June, the media got wind that Fury and his cousin Hughie, also a heavyweight boxer, had been charged with a doping offence after the banned substance nandrolone was allegedly discovered in their urine samples.
However, the samples were taken 19 months ago, nine months before Fury outpointed his Ukrainian rival, 40, in Dusseldorf.
Fury claims he was told by Ukad that he would face no action over the test and that a blood test taken at the time, as well as all tests since, revealed no traces. Hughie's case will also be reviewed by the National Anti-Doping Panel.
Fury's long-time promoter Mick Hennessy said he was ""very, very confident"" that his fighter would be exonerated after the investigation.
Fury did not attend Monday's news conference in London because his car broke down on the way down from his home in Morecambe.
But his uncle and trainer Peter Fury said the boxer was ""very upset"" with Ukad and the way he has been treated by the British public.
""There's been chaos around this fight, especially with Ukad slipping statements out to the press,"" said Peter Fury.
""Tyson was found guilty before he was even tried. But I told him that the main thing is he knows what the truth is and that it will come out eventually.""
At a news conference to announce the first fight between the two rivals, Fury turned up as Batman, prompting Klitschko to speculate that perhaps he had dressed as the Invisible Man on Monday.
Klitschko, who had threatened to sue Fury's team over alleged contract tampering, also suggested his rival might not even show up on fight night.
""I wouldn't have been surprised if Tyson Fury had turned up and sung a song, so I'm not surprised he hasn't turned up at all,"" said Klitschko, whose defeat by Fury in their first encounter was his first for more than 11 years.
""Even if it doesn't happen in October, I will wait. I've never had such a long break between fights but I've been active, even if I haven't been competing.
""I'm just waiting for my revenge. I just hope he's going to turn up.
""I'm enjoying being the challenger. It has been a great experience for me and it has made me obsessed with the goal of getting the belts back again.""
""I don't feel my age. I'm still capable of performing as an athlete and I've just gained more experience as a fighter. And I'm not concerned about ring rust, because ring rust is in your head.""
Asked how the rematch would be different, Klitschko said: ""The end of the fight is going to be different. I'm not just obsessed about winning this fight, I'm obsessed about winning impressively.""
Since beating Klitschko, Fury has been stripped of his IBF title for refusing to fight the governing body's mandatory challenger.
The IBF belt is now held by Fury's compatriot Anthony Joshua, while American Deontay Wilder is the WBC champion.

Oracle surged to victory by 44 seconds to retain the Cup they won in 2010.
The Kiwis won four of the first five races, making Oracle modify their boat and call Ainslie from the warm-up crew.
The British sailing legend, 36, a four-time Olympic champion, was drafted in as tactician in place of American veteran John Kostecki and was instrumental in the US outfit's resurgence.
""It's been one of the most amazing comebacks ever, I think, almost in any sport but certainly in sailing and to be a part of that is a huge privilege,"" said Ainslie.
Ainslie combined superbly with Oracle's Australian skipper James Spithill and strategist Tom Slingsby, another Australian who won Laser gold at London 2012, to drag the syndicate back from the brink in the most remarkable turnaround in the event's 162-year history.
""To be perfectly honest, we had a mountain to climb,"" Ainslie added. ""We knew we had to sort ourselves out. We had to get the boat going faster. We did that.
""The designers did a great job and we had to start sailing better. We got the momentum going and we started believing in ourselves. When you do that, you can become quite strong. ""

But the US outfit, bankrolled by software billionaire Larry Ellison, were soon up to speed and won 10 of the next 12 races to lift the oldest trophy in international sport, known affectionately as the ""Auld Mug"".
The Kiwis, led by skipper Dean Barker, came within two minutes of glory in race 13 in uncharacteristic light winds before organisers abandoned the race because the 40-minute time limit had elapsed.
In the decider in fresh breeze and sunshine on San Francisco Bay, Team New Zealand edged a tight start and beat Oracle to the first mark. The Kiwis stayed clear around the second mark but lost the lead to the Americans early on the upwind leg.
After briefly retaking the advantage, the Kiwis then watched as Oracle stormed ahead with remarkable upwind pace and remained clear for a comfortable win.

""On your own, you're nothing, but a team like this can make you look great. We were facing the barrel of a gun at 8-1 and the guys didn't even flinch. Thanks to San Francisco, this is one hell of a day.""

""I'm incredibly proud of our team and what they've achieved, but I'm gutted we didn't get the last win we needed to take the Cup back to New Zealand.""
As winners, Oracle will decide on the format, venue and timing of the 35th America's Cup.
The US syndicate first won the Cup in 2010, when they beat holders Alinghi of Switzerland in a one-off match in huge multihulls following protracted legal wrangling.
Ellison and Oracle Team USA boss Russell Coutts, who won the Cup for New Zealand in 1995 and 2000 before defecting to Alinghi for 2003, devised a new concept for the 2013 competition.
They opted for revolutionary 72ft catamarans with rigid wing sails - and foiling daggerboards later pioneered by the Kiwis - which allowed the boats to reach startling speeds of more than 50mph.
Races were brought inshore to make it more accessible for fans, while cutting-edge TV production with on-screen graphics were introduced to make it more appealing for a new audience of TV viewers.
But the format was controversial and designs untested, with critics fearing for the safety of sailors.
Oracle capsized last year, but it was the death of British Olympian Andrew Simpson in a training accident in May that prompted wide-ranging safety measures, including upper wind-speed limits and personal breathing apparatus.
Critics also pointed to spiralling costs, with only three teams - Artemis Racing of Sweden, Emirates Team New Zealand and Luna Rossa Challenge of Italy - emerging to compete in the Louis Vuitton Cup challenger series for the right to take on Oracle.
Artemis were unable to mount a meaningful campaign after Simpson's death, as Team New Zealand outclassed Luna Rossa in a one-sided Louis Vuitton Cup final.
But despite Team New Zealand's early stranglehold and a number of races postponed because of unfavourable winds, the America's Cup showed that match-racing in giant catamarans can be hugely exciting and is likely to be the future of the event.",Sir Ben Ainslie's Oracle Team USA sealed one of sport's greatest comebacks when they overhauled an 8-1 deficit to beat Team New Zealand in the America's Cup decider in San Francisco.,24274103,"Oracle Team USA, led by skipper James Spithill and tactician Ben Ainslie, made a remarkable comeback in the America's Cup, overtaking Team New Zealand to win the trophy after being docked two points for cheating, with Ainslie playing a crucial role in the US outfit's resurgence.",0,"Article: {}

Black bags are currently collected fortnightly.
The council's head of environment, Richard Brown said there will be ""high public interest"" whatever they come up with.
A report before the policy scrutiny committee outlined the challenges faced by the council's waste service as a result of funding pressures.
It said Â£1.2m needed to be saved over the next four years. This is in addition to potential fines for missing statutory performance targets.
Five options were presented to the committee. They looked at what was being collected, how often and by what means.
Options for black bin bag collection were weekly, fortnightly and three-weekly, while limiting the number of customer-provided sacks to two or three.

206,208,"The writer's political play This House has just transferred to London's West End, four years after it premiered at The National Theatre.
Asked what his next project will be, Graham told BBC News: ""I'm working on a TV drama about the referendum campaign.
""I think [Brexit] is going to be the main occupying idea in all writers' heads for the next five or 10 years.""
He added: ""That doesn't mean necessarily writing a dramatic re-enactment of referendum night, I think it just means the new mood we're living in, which is very different, a bit scary, very divisive, very angry, very confused.""
But Graham confirmed that his TV drama will ""specifically tackle what happened"" in the run-up to the EU referendum on 23 June.
The playwright has previously written a short play about Brexit for The Guardian as well as The Vote, a play set in a polling station, which was televised on More4 on the night of the 2015 general election.
His other credits include musical Finding Neverland - for which Graham wrote the script and Gary Barlow the music and lyrics - and Privacy, which made its debut on Broadway earlier this year starring Daniel Radcliffe.
This House deals with the struggles of the Labour government between 1974 and 1979.
It debuted at the National Theatre in 2012, and recently had a run at the Chichester Theatre before transferring to the West End.
The play's director Jeremy Herrin said he was ""delighted"" by the reaction the play has had.
""We haven't really changed much of it, James has kept the same script,"" he told the BBC.
""When we first did it, the audience's obsession was much more about the coalition government in 2010 and how that was working out, and now it's much more about what's happening in the Labour Party.""
He added: ""It's much more about dignity and honour in politics, and whether the procedure can reflect our natures.
""Particularly post-Trump, it feels like that's the big question in the production - is it possible to be a decent human being in a parliamentary framework? So the play starts to answer that question.""
The Guardian's Michael Billington described This House as ""enthralling"" in his five star review of the play after its West End opening.
""Graham brilliantly captures the daily machinations of politics,"" he wrote. ""The whole ensemble contributes to a thrilling play that both relives history and transcends it.""
Writing in The Telegraph, Dominic Cavendish said This House is ""the most intelligent, entertaining and informative political drama of this decade"".
He added: ""This House is a must for those who want to learn more (or be reminded about) the very peculiar workings of Westminster and its often quietly heroic occupants.""
The play was described as ""magnificently sharp and witty"" by Fiona Mountford in The Evening Standard.
""Whoever would have thought that the intricacies of a minority government struggling to pass a series of bills would have been so engrossing?""
She added: ""Both a treat and a triumph, this is a superlative night out in the West End.""
Comedian Jack Whitehall, who also attended Wednesday evening's press performance, described it on Twitter as an ""incredible, amazing production"".
Culture Minister Matt Hancock said it was a ""brilliant portrayal of 1970s political drama"".

The Islamic State (IS) group, which holds territory in the north and west, said it was behind some of the attacks.

The eatery was popular with members of the Popular Mobilisation, a predominantly Shia militia which has taken a lead role in the fight against IS, the Associated Press reports.

208,210,"Mr Navalny could now be barred from running in the Moscow mayoral election set for September. He also joins a growing list of opponents of President Vladimir Putin who have ended up on the wrong side of the law or in exile, or have met their deaths in suspicious circumstances.
When Mr Putin first became president in 2000, he immediately set about curbing the power of the oligarchs - the group of billionaires who exerted huge influence over Russia's political system and media.
His first victim was media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky, the owner of NTV, a station that at the time was highly critical of Moscow's war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and was home to the satirical puppet show Kukly, which mercilessly mocked the new president.
When Mr Gusinsky refused to allow the Kremlin to influence NTV's editorial policy he quickly found himself charged with fraud in June 2000, and fled the country shortly afterwards.
Within months, he was joined by his fellow media magnate and political fixer Boris Berezovsky.
Mr Berezovsky is believed to have played a key role in helping Mr Putin into power in 2000. But he quickly fell out of favour with the new regime and sought refuge in the UK.
Mr Berezovsky continued to plot against Mr Putin and to be held up as a bogeyman by the Russian media until he was found dead in the bathroom of his Berkshire home in March this year. Police have said that there is no evidence of anybody else being involved in his death.
Perhaps most famously Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the former head of the now defunct oil company, Yukos, was targeted when (like Mr Navalny) he accused Mr Putin and his associates of conniving in massive corruption.
He has subsequently been convicted in two trials of tax evasion and fraud. Following his second trial in 2010, Amnesty International recognised Mr Khodorkovsky and his co-defendant, Platon Lebedev, as ""prisoners of conscience"".
Mr Khodorkovsky is due for release in 2014, but there are signs that he could face further charges.
Political opposition to Mr Putin is becoming an increasingly risky business, with numerous activists facing charges or in jail.
Two members of feminist band Pussy Riot are serving two-year prison sentences for ""hooliganism motivated by religious hatred"" after performing an ""anti-Putin punk prayer"" in Moscow's main Orthodox cathedral in February 2012. A third member of the band had her sentence suspended on appeal.
Meanwhile, criminal charges of affray, incitement to violence and assaulting police officers are pending against more than 20 activists involved in disturbances at a demonstration in Moscow on the eve of Mr Putin's inauguration as president for a third term in May 2012.
Sergei Udaltsov, a left-wing leader of the protest movement, is under house arrest after being charged with incitement to mass disorder on the basis of video evidence shown on Russian TV. If found guilty, Mr Udaltsov (like Mr Navalny) could face a substantial prison sentence.
Some members of the Russian opposition, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, continue to defy Mr Putin despite regular harassment and detention for public order offences.
Like Mr Navalny, Mr Nemtsov is a member of the opposition's alternative parliament, the Coordination Council. He is also co-author of a report accusing Mr Putin of leading Russia to ruin.
Another member of the Coordination Council, former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, has joined the growing list of Russia's political emigres.
But, as the fate of former FSB (Federal Security Service) officer Alexander Litvinenko showed, even exile carries risks for Mr Putin's opponents.
Mr Litvinenko died in London in 2006 after being poisoned by radioactive polonium.
It is not just oligarchs and politicians who have to fear Putin's disfavour. Journalists and TV presenters, too, have to be wary of offending the Kremlin.
Ksenia Sobchak, whose father Anatoly was Mr Putin's political mentor, was a familiar face on light entertainment shows on Russia TV until she joined the protest movement following the disputed parliamentary election in 2011.
Since then, her lucrative contracts on mainstream TV have dried up and her appearances have been confined to the niche liberal channel Dozhd - a refuge for several dissident journalists.
Mr Putin makes little secret of his hostility to journalists who challenge his authority.
Shortly after the murder in 2006 of Anna Politkovskaya, a reporter with opposition newspaper Novaya Gazeta and fierce critic of the Kremlin's policies in Chechnya, Mr Putin dismissed her political influence as ""negligible"".
Ms Politkovskaya is one of five Novaya Gazeta journalists who have been murdered or died in suspicious circumstances since 2000.

In doing so, the country has rejected the advice of barrister Amal Clooney, who had urged Greece to take Britain to the International Criminal Court.
The Marbles were taken from Greece's Parthenon by Lord Elgin 200 years ago.
Greece insists the Parthenon Sculptures - as they are properly known - were taken illegally and has pursued a high-profile campaign in recent years for their return, latterly with the help of Mrs Clooney.
Mrs Clooney reportedly submitted a 150-page report to the Greek government this week urging it to formally request the repatriation of the marbles and take Britain to the International Criminal Court if it refused.
But Greece's culture minister Nikos Xydakis told the country's Mega TV: ""One cannot go to court over whatever issue. Besides, in international courts the outcome is uncertain"".
He said he believed attitudes to the future of the Marbles were slowly changing and would favour Greece in a diplomatic approach.
For 30 years, Athens has been locked in a bitter dispute over its demand for the marbles to be returned.

211,213,"They talk of a boy who dressed smartly and worked hard, but who barely said a word during his time at school.
Police officers have said he may have had a personality or developmental disorder, while one relative told ABC News he was ""obviously not well"".
Lanza appears to have kept a low profile throughout his life. US media report that unusually, his high school yearbook of 2010 contained no photograph of him.
""Camera shy"" was the comment by his entry.
Unlike the majority of his peers, Lanza apparently had no Facebook page. His online footprint was minimal. He appears not to have been known to the police.
Adam Lanza lived with his mother in a well-to-do neighbourhood of Newtown, Connecticut. The house is about five miles (8km) from Sandy Hook School, which he attended as a child.
He went on to Newtown High School, but made few friends. His mother pulled him out of the school and taught him at home because she was unhappy with the school district's plan for his education.
His aunt, Marsha Lanza, said that Adam was ""definitely the challenge to the family in that house"".
""Every family has one. I have one. They have one. â€¦ But he was a very bright boy, he was smart,"" she said.
Intelligent but shy and nervous were the most common memories of those who learnt beside him.
Richard Novia, who was head of security at Newtown High School, said it was clear Lanza had ""some disabilities"".
He was protective of his personal space and sometimes appeared to completely withdraw into himself or to ""take flight"", Mr Novia told AP, meaning his mother had to be called in to resolve the problem.
""You had yourself a very scared young boy, who was very nervous around people he could trust or he refused to speak with.""
Mr Novia helped to run a technology club, which Lanza attended, and said he had to keep a close eye on him while the club was using soldering equipment or electrical equipment.
""If that boy would've burned himself, he would not have known it or felt it physically,"" he said.
An inability to respond to sensation, and a difficult in relating to other people, could be an indication of Asperger's Syndrome (a form of autism), say experts.
They stress there is no direct link between the condition and aggression. People with the condition can sometimes struggle to express themselves in socially expected ways, however.
Olivia DeVivo was a student with Lanza in the 10th grade, at about the age of 15. She told the Associated Press he was ""very shy and didn't make an effort to interact with anybody"".
""Now looking back, it's kind of like 'OK, he had all these signs,' but you can't say every shy person would do something like this,"" she said.
A former school bus driver in the town, Marsha Moskowitz, said she remembered the Lanza boys.
""You know the trouble kids, and you figure, 'Pfft, that one's going to be trouble.' But I never would have thought that about them,"" she told the Hartford Courant newspaper.
Marsha Lanza told the Associated Press that Adam had been raised by kind, nurturing parents, who would not have hesitated to seek counselling for their son if he needed it.
The parents divorced in 2009, having separated at least three years earlier. His father, Peter Lanza, moved to Stamford, Connecticut, and recently remarried.
His mother, Nancy, remained in the family home, where it is thought she was killed by her son. She had previously worked in finance, but her divorce settlement left her well off and she stayed at home.
Friends said she was popular and sociable. An acquaintance, Jim Leff, wrote on his blog that she was ""a friend-of-friends who I periodically would briefly bump into, and who always seemed kind-hearted... and, yes, a bit high-strung. But with ample reason, as it turns out.""
Contrary to initial reports, Nancy Lanza never worked as a teacher at Sandy Hook Elementary School.
She was a gun enthusiast who is reported to have taken her sons with her to the shooting range. Adam Lanza used her legally purchased Bushmaster assault rifle to carry out his attack. He was also carrying his mother's two handguns, a Glock pistol and a Sig Sauer. Police found a shotgun in his car.
Adam Lanza's elder brother, 24-year-old Ryan, who was initially named in the media as the suspected gunman, has been helping police with their investigation. US media is reporting that he told them he had had no contact with his brother since 2010.
In a statement issued to the media, Lanza's father said: ""No words can truly express how heartbroken we are.

212,214,"Writing in her autobiography, she claimed the director ""threw himself"" on top of her in the back of his limousine and tried to kiss her.
The actress described the encounter as ""an awful, awful moment"".
Hedren added that she didn't tell anyone because ""sexual harassment and stalking were terms that didn't exist"" in the early 1960s.
She continued: ""Besides, he was Alfred Hitchcock, one of Universal's superstars, and I was just a lucky little blonde model he'd rescued from relative obscurity. Which one of us was more valuable to the studio, him or me?""
Hedren appeared in The Birds in 1963 and the following year starred in Marnie - both of which were directed by Hitchcock.
The actress, now 86, made the claims in her autobiography Tippi: A Memoir, which is published in November.
She has spoken in the past about the director's alleged treatment of her, but has gone into more detail in the memoir.
Hedren described a later encounter in Hitchcock's office where the director ""suddenly grabbed"" her and ""put his hands"" on her.
She wrote: ""It was sexual, it was perverse, and it was ugly, and I couldn't have been more shocked and more repulsed.
""The harder I fought him, the more aggressive he became. Then he started adding threats, as if he could do anything to me that was worse than what he was trying to do at that moment.""
After refusing his demands, Hedren said Hitchcock ""looked directly into my eyes, his face red with rage, and promised, 'I'll ruin your career.'""
The actress said Hitchcock then made her life difficult, refusing to submit her work for the Oscar nominations or let her take on other acting roles while he still had her under contract.
Hedren, whose daughter Melanie Griffith is also an actress, said: ""I've made it my mission ever since to see to it that while Hitchcock may have ruined my career, I never gave him the power to ruin my life.""
She went on to say that, despite his treatment of her, she felt ""a wave of sadness"" when he died in 1980.
""It surprised everyone that I went to Hitchcock's funeral,"" she wrote, adding: ""As far as I was concerned, there was no unfinished business between us, nothing more that needed to be said.

213,215,"The retailer has been under fire over zero hours contracts and disclosure that staff at a warehouse were paid less than the minimum wage.
Independent shareholders had called for changes to the way the company was run.
Sources told the BBC that Mr Forsey was ""not coerced"", and that Mr Ashley is a permanent replacement, not temporary.
The billionaire businessman has given up his role as executive deputy chairman.
BBC business correspondent Joe Lynam said sources told him that the shake-up was not part of a plan to take Sports Direct private.
There has been speculation that, following months of criticism of the company, Mr Ashley wanted to remove Sports Direct from the stock market.
Mr Ashley, who owns more than 50% of the company, said in a statement: ""I feel like I have lost my right arm, but I do hope to have the opportunity to work with Dave again in the future.""
Mr Forsey has worked for the retailer for 32 years after starting as a part-time worker when he was 18.
Earlier this year he agreed to forgo a £3.7m share award in recognition of the problems at the company.
Mr Forsey said: ""I have given my entire working life to the company and in return the company has given me amazing opportunities and experiences.""
Sports Direct's board made two other changes, promoting Karen Byers to the role of global head of operations, and Sean Nevitt to the role of global head of commercial.
Amid criticism over Sports Direct's working practices and bad publicity, there had been calls by shareholders for the removal of chairman Keith Hellawell.
The company, which has around 450 retail outlets, came under the spotlight after an investigation uncovered that staff were kept on site at its giant Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire after their shifts for body searches.
These took so long that their pay effectively dipped below the minimum wage.
Mr Ashley, Sports Direct's billionaire founder, was called to answer questions from MPs, who compared working practices at the warehouse with ""that of a Victorian workhouse than that of a modern High Street retailer"".
In the wake of that, the sportswear chain's lawyers produced a critical report of its working conditions.
The company was criticised for its use of zero hours contracts. It says it will offer workers who want them guaranteed hours. It also said it would put a worker on the board.
That report also criticised Mr Forsey for failing to inform the Sports Direct board about some of the issues at Shirebrook.
But calls for an independent review continued and earlier this week, Sports Direct said it would authorise such a study of working practices and corporate governance, following concerns raised by shareholders.
Mr Ashley denied knowing much about the way Shirebrook operated, telling the BBC: ""You'd be surprised how little I knew of what was going on.""
Like so many in the company's hierarchy, Karen Byers, Sports Direct's new global head of operations met founder Mike Ashley informally and has known him a very long time.
She's been with the company for more than 20 years and it is said she got the job after trying to sell Mike Ashley a pair of jeans. Despite being head of retail at a publicly-listed retail giant with 30,000 employees for much at that time, she's very low profile indeed.
Earlier this year Mike Ashley himself singled her out in a rare interview he gave to the Times newspaper: ""Karen Byers runs Sports Direct. She runs the retail, all the money comes out the retail, [the warehouse workers and store managers] are her army. She is the person who sets the rules. Not me.""
One investment analyst firm said she was well regarded inside the company and out. The same firm though said she was not known for her ""flowery or evasive approach"". Just like her boss.
Paul Blomfield, a member of the Business Innovation and Skills committee which grilled Mike Ashley in June, is not convinced by the changes: ""What our committee wanted to happen was for the company to seriously address what was, not just problems around the edges, but systemic labour exploitation in the workplace. And whether Mr Ashley is the person to do that - given the evidence he gave to our committee - is yet to be seen.""
Mike Fox, from shareholder Royal London Asset Management, wasn't impressed with Friday's board changes either: ""The installation of Mike Ashley as chief executive, consolidating his influence at the top of the business, is unlikely to reassure anyone.""
He said the way the company was run had long been a problem and that Sports Direct still needed a new chairman before it could rebuild trust with investors.
Sarah Wilson, chief executive of shareholder pressure group, Manifest, told BBC Radio 5 live the move added another corporate governance problem: ""Are we going to see [Mike Ashley] step down from his other job as deputy chairman?
""Had Mike Ashley listened to shareholders four or five years ago, we might not be in the situation we're in at the moment.""
She said the company's actions were not just damaging to shareholders but ""undermined the general public's perception of capitalism - full stop"".
Nevertheless, market reaction suggests most investors were pleased that Mike Ashley would have a more direct role in the company and the shares were up about 5% in morning trade.
Mr Ashley's brash style is unorthodox for the founder and executive of a leading UK company. The owner of Newcastle United football club was photographed with a wad of cash when he took shareholders and journalists on a tour of the Shirebrook site after the shareholders' meeting.

217,219,"Michael Gunn, a retired chartered accountant, wants to spend some of it on a new roof for the church hall.
But in defiance of experts, he also wants to use the money for a transatlantic cruise.
The changes take effect on Bank Holiday Monday, so Mr Gunn will receive the payment on Tuesday morning.
""I had no idea they'd whisk me into the limelight, and say I am the first,"" he told the BBC. ""But I don't mind that.""
Initially he wants to donate cash to the fund for the church hall roof - in the village of Newton Poppleford - after it burnt down in a fire.
But later in the year he is planning to take his wife across the Atlantic on board the Queen Mary Two.
Mr Gunn was not prepared to say how much he would be taking out of his pension pot, but he has taken care to heed warnings about tax bills.
""What I like about this is that you are totally in charge of how much tax you are exposed to - to stay within a lower tax band,"" he said.
Last week the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said thousands of people withdrawing money might find themselves paying much more tax than they needed to.
Other experts have pointed out that, in any case, people taking out cash will have to pay what is called ""emergency tax"".
Unless individuals can show a P45 tax form, HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) will treat any payments as if they are a new monthly salary.
In other words, they will charge tax on the basis that the new income is repeated every month for a year.
So anyone cashing in a pension of Â£18,000 - assuming nothing is taken tax-free- would be charged an immediate tax bill of Â£6,592.
Those in that position will have to reclaim the tax using forms P50 or P53.
However HMRC has promised they will get the money back within a month.
Meanwhile, hundreds of staff from Citizens Advice - and Citizens Advice Scotland - are preparing to offer free face-to-face interviews with anyone who needs help, from Tuesday.
Those aged 55 or over can go to one of 500 offices in England and Wales, or 90 in Scotland. Those living in very remote areas of Scotland can arrange home visits.
But customers will only receive ""guidance"", not advice.
""What we don't do is provide any details of which companies people can go to for pensions - or which particular products,"" said Richard Chilton, one of those who will be conducting the interviews.
""But we provide guidance on what the options are,"" he said.
Anyone wanting to book an interview, or receive telephone guidance, should call the Pension Wise service, on 030 0330 1001.

221,223,"Businessman Jeffrey Spector, 54, of St Annes, Lancashire, died on Friday following a six-year illness.
He was surrounded by friends and family at a meal shortly before his death at the clinic, which aids accompanied suicide.
His wife Elaine and three daughters said they respected his decision.
The family said in a statement: ""Whilst we are now in a state of all-consuming grief and miss Jeffrey very much, we also recognise that he is now at peace and away from the fear which surrounded him in the last few weeks of his life.
""Jeffrey ended his life with dignity and control which was his overwhelming desire.""
In an interview with the Blackpool Gazette last week, Mr Spector said: ""If I am paralysed and can't speak, send me to the spirit world.""
He reportedly said the condition was affecting his nervous system.
Friend Linda Earle, who had known him for 20 years, said: ""He's fought it every step of the way. I've never known a man try so hard.
""I don't blame him for a minute....it's no one else's decision but his own.""
Journalist David Graham told BBC Radio Lancashire he had spoken to Mr Spector at his hotel near the clinic in Zurich.
Mr Graham said Mr Spector, a director of an advertising agency, had had a series of consultations with leading surgeons across the UK.
""He had one operation which failed and I think that spurred him on the Dignitas route,"" said Mr Graham.
In England and Wales, the Suicide Act 1961 makes it an offence to encourage or assist a suicide or a suicide attempt.
Former Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer said he would attempt to reintroduce a bill that would allow assisted dying in the UK.
He said it was ""completely wrong"" that terminally ill people did not have the option to end their life.
""Whatever your take on the subject, it should be debated,"" Lord Falconer told the BBC.
Last year the Director of Public Prosecutions, Alison Saunders, clarified assisted suicide guidelines, making the prosecution of health professionals less likely.
However, in April, disability rights campaigners who said assisted suicide policy was too ""liberal"" won permission to bring a legal challenge to her policy.
Rob George, president of the Association for Palliative Medicine, said he was concerned about any possible law change.
He said: ""This is a dangerous distraction from providing decent health care, and actually it's the dying that we need to look after.
""Our job is to look after people as they die... not in order that they die.""
However, the daughter of a woman who died at Dignitas last year said she wanted the law to change so that terminally ill people could end their life at home.
Jayne Bramwell's daughter Lindsay said that it would help to ""ease the path for everyone involved and make what is a horrendous time a bit easier"".
She said it was ""enormously distressing"" for her mother to have to travel to Switzerland in a wheelchair.
""She just wanted to be at home and have all her family with her..."" she said.
In 2008, a paralysed rugby player from Worcester died at Dignitas.
Daniel James, 23, had a collapsed spine following an accident during training with Nuneaton Rugby Club. The Director of Public Prosecutions said prosecutions in the case would not be in the public interest.
Dignitas, which said it aided ""accompanied suicide"", often described as assisted suicide, has not commented specifically on the Jeffrey Spector case.

It blasted off on a Vega rocket from South America just after 13:40 GMT.
The test data could also inform future Mars landing technologies.
The demonstrator flew east around the globe, before coming down in the water west of the Galapagos Islands at about 15:20 GMT.
The wedge-shaped IXV (Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle) was designed to gather information on how space objects fall back to Earth.
Commenting on the flight, Esa director-general Jean-Jacques Dordain said: ""It couldn't have gone better.
""But the mission itself is not over because now it is necessary to analyse all the data gathered during the flight.""
At the time the craft re-entered the atmosphere, it was moving at 7.5km/s. As it pushed against the air, the temperatures on its leading surfaces would have soared to 1,700C.
Flaps and thrusters controlled the trajectory, ensuring the IXV came down close to a recovery ship.
A parachute system deployed in the very late stages of the flight and put the two-tonne vehicle gently in the ocean. Floatation balloons came out to stop it from sinking.
Europe's expertise on re-entry technologies is more limited than, say, the US's or Russia's - something it wants to change with the help of the IXV.
Esa's project manager Giorgio Tumino told BBC News: ""Europe is excellent at going to orbit; we have all the launchers, for example. We also have great knowhow in operating complex systems in orbit. But where we are a bit behind is in the knowledge of how to come back from orbit.
""So, if we are to close the circle - go to orbit, stay in orbit, come back from orbit - we need to master this third leg as well as other spacefaring nations.""
Esa has already approved a follow-on spacecraft, called Pride, which looks very similar in design to the X-37B, a robotic craft operated by the American military.
No-one is quite sure what missions are flown by the X-37B, but they are likely to include the early testing of new technologies for future satellites.
This could be a role also for Europe's Pride vehicle. In-orbit servicing of satellites is a capability often discussed in this context as well.
Esa nations will meet shortly to define these roles.
""We need still to agree with all the member states all the different types of operations in orbit.

No clear reason was given for the sackings, but analysts say Mr Kiir and Mr Machar have been embroiled in a power struggle for months.
South Sudan has suffered from chronic economic problems since it split from Sudan in 2011.
There was tight security outside ministry buildings on Wednesday, while radio broadcasts urged people to remain calm, the AFP news agency reports.
Its stability has been hampered by lingering rows over territory and oil with its northern neighbour.
Recently some of Mr Kiir's colleagues have hinted at discontent with his leadership.
Local reports say Mr Kiir is battling to maintain control of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), the former rebel group that now runs the country.
Mr Machar, who had been stripped of some of his powers in April, had hinted that he may stand against Mr Kiir for leadership of the SPLM before the next presidential election in 2015.
By Nyambura WambuguBBC News, Juba
Dissolving the cabinet in South Sudan hints at a wider attempt by the president to restructure not only the government but power and access to power in the country.
There have been reports in recent weeks of strained relations within the governing SPLM and the relationship between the president and his deputy are said to be at an all-time low.
Although the cabinet restructuring has been a long time coming, its timing is curious and raises suspicions that the president could be using his executive powers to stamp out dissent in the party and disagreement within his government.
Whether the sacking of the entire cabinet will succeed in calming the disquiet within South Sudan's political circles remains to be seen -there is also a real fear that this might further divide the country along ethnic lines.
The BBC's Nyambura Wambugu in the capital, Juba, says there is a real fear that the sacking could further divide the country along ethnic lines.
Mr Kiir is from the Dinka community, which is the largest in South Sudan, while Mr Machar is from the second-largest group, the Nuer, some of whom have complained about Dinka domination.
Under-secretaries have been put in charge of the departments and the government insists it can function smoothly until new ministers are appointed.
Barnaba Marial Benjamin, who had been information minister until Tuesday, characterised the sackings as a ""major reshuffle"" and said it was part of Mr Kiir's constitutional mandate.
""Some of these people will come back and some will not,"" Mr Benjamin AFP.
Among the other leaders to be dismissed was Pagan Amum, the top negotiator in peace talks with Sudan.
He was removed from his post as SPLM secretary general and the decree said he would be investigated for mismanaging the party.
Last month Mr Kiir sacked two other senior ministers embroiled in a multi-million dollar financial scandal, a decision reportedly criticised by Mr Amum.
It was unclear whether Tuesday's decree had any link to the scandal.
South Sudanese journalist Nhial Bol said Mr Kiir had probably acted to end the paralysis in his government.
""Things have not been moving in the government because of this internal fighting over who is going to control the SPLM,"" Mr Bol told Reuters news agency.
South Sudan is rich in oil, but is one of Africa's least developed countries, with few paved roads and poor health and educational facilities.
It gained independence from Sudan in July 2011 after a decades-long civil war.
However, the oil refineries are on Sudanese territory, so the South relies on its northern neighbour to get its product on to the market.","South Sudan's president has sacked his entire cabinet, in an apparent power struggle with other senior leaders.",23428557,"South Sudan's President Salva Kiir dismissed all cabinet ministers and the vice president, Riek Machar, in a move that may be a power play to maintain control of the ruling Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) party ahead of the 2015 presidential election, amid ongoing tensions and economic struggles in the young nation.",0,"Article: {}

232,234,"LGC Forensics, the biggest commercial provider, said the private sector was ready to take on the work of the FSS, but expressed concern that the forensics market was shrinking.
The government announced last year that the FSS would close, with as many of its operations as possible being transferred or sold off.
The government wants private enterprise, which currently makes up 40% of the market, to fill the gap left behind by the FSS.
But some experts are concerned that an over-emphasis on profits could threaten the quality of science.
The FSS analyses evidence from crime scenes in England and Wales, but has been losing about £2m a month.
In a written submission to the inquiry, Steve Allen, the managing director of LGC Forensics, commented: ""The closure of the FSS will not damage the prospects for forensic science in the UK so long as its wind-down is properly implemented and is used by the government as an opportunity to support a properly regulated market of a sufficient size to enable competition between dedicated market participants.""
The Home Office has tasked the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) with managing the gradual wind down of the FSS.
Written evidence from David Hartshorne and Roger Derbyshire, directors at commercial provider Cellmark, said there would be no negative impacts on the quality or impartiality of forensic evidence.
""Forensic scientists in the private sector have exactly the same motivation to support the criminal justice system and the victims of crime as those in the public sector,"" they said.
""[Private sector scientists'] ethics and impartiality are independent of the organisation for whom they work; and ultimately, when they stand in the witness box to provide evidence, they are representing themselves rather than the company that employs them.""
In a written response to parliamentary questions on 1 February, Crime Reduction Minister James Brokenshire said advice from ACPO, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) and others suggested that the UK forensics market would contract from £170 million in 2009 towards about £110 million by 2015.
In addition, police forces have been bringing forensic work in-house, in order to make cost savings. And commentators say this could pose an impediment to the future expansion of the private forensics market.
Some forensic scientists have expressed dismay at the FSS's closure, voicing concerns about the quality of science, the retention of expertise and the future of forensic research and development (R&D) once the service is closed down.
In a letter to New Scientist magazine in January, Professor Alec Jeffreys, who pioneered the technique of genetic fingerprinting at the University of Leicester, said the decision to close the FSS could not be in the interests of justice.
""Who will provide the expertise for complex and interdisciplinary investigations, and who will develop and refine new technologies? The private sector is most unlikely to fill this void,"" he wrote.
As reported by BBC News last month, Peter Gill, professor of forensic genetics at the University of Oslo, said there was a mismatch between the government's aim to commercialise forensic science and the requirement of courts for openness.
He added that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details were kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues.
Mr Brokenshire has said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. This course is questioned by Prospect union, which represents scientists and engineers, in their evidence to the inquiry.
""Currently the forensic science regulator sits in the Home Office, but... Prospect understands that there are very limited powers and no statutory influence,"" the union wrote.
It added: ""Additional regulatory powers will be needed to ensure that there is a level playing field between police forces and private contractors. It will also be essential to ensure that forensic science practitioners have recognisable and respected qualifications and a professional code of ethics.""
Professor Allan Jamieson, director of the Forensic Institute in Glasgow, which is a commercial supplier of forensic services, said there was ""no reason to expect that, if properly managed, this market cannot deliver the required service at a fair price"".
But he highlighted the need for the involvement of the wider scientific community in UK forensic science to prevent it from becoming isolated.
""It cannot be known whether any provider has met the scientific standard if there is no scientific research to measure the standard against,"" he wrote in his submission.
""Perhaps properly funding this essential research is the obvious, logical, and necessary step to prevent the feared decline of standards in forensic science.""
The FSS is headquartered in Birmingham, with a number of laboratories around England and Wales; it has already closed laboratories at Chepstow and central Birmingham to help bring costs under control. The service previously employed about 1,600 staff.

Supporters say it is a handy way for the Indian government to tackle corruption.

So why is it holding elections? And how reliable are they?
Local elections have been held in North Korea since 1999 - let's not forget that the country's full name is, technically, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
Sunday's elections are to decide provincial governors, mayors and local assemblies in the country of almost 25m people.
The number of seats is determined by each district's population.
In the second provincial elections in 2003, one report said 26,650 ""officials, workers, peasants and intellectuals"" were elected.
The choice is limited - there is only one candidate on the ballot in each district, and while the selection of candidates is made by the governing coalition, they are closely overseen by Kim Jong-un's Workers' Party.
Ahead of last year's elections to name deputies for the country's assembly, The Economist reported that voting did not take place in secret, and any dissenting votes must be placed in a separate ballot box.
Abstaining or voting no are considered acts of treason.
In the last local election, in 2011, there was a turnout of 99.7%, with the state news agency saying those unable to vote were abroad or on the high seas.
Having such a high reported turnout has its advantages for the state, observers say, in that it acts as an informal census.
""The government checks the list of voters and if your name is not on the list, they will investigate it"", one North Korean defector told the NK News website.
""It is often during election that the government finds out about defectors and people who have been missed.""

Thousands more have also commented via the Sina Weibo microblog.
Mr Bai has spent seven years and more than one million yuan ($150,000; Â£117,000) on the resort, which is in a spacious mountainous region of Hangzhou in eastern Zhejiang province.
It has assault courses and long walking paths for the dogs. There is also a cemetery at the site, where 26 of Bai's former ""comrades"" are buried.
In an interview with local paper Qianjiang Evening News in June, Mr Bai explained the reason for setting up the home.
He said it was largely because he didn't want to take the simple route of euthanising one of his dogs, Sonny, after the elderly Alsatian contracted skin cancer.
Mr Bai claimed that rather than following vets' advice and having the animal put to sleep, he spent time giving daily medicinal baths to bring Sonny's illness under control.
After that experience, he said he reached an understanding that retired dogs, much as humans, ""need daily care"".
Mr Bai has been a police dog handler since 2004, and has trained over 30 police dogs. Currently, 16 of his former dogs are residents at the retirement home.
""They have accompanied me for over 10 years; you could say they are my work comrades, or even my family,"" he told local media in June.
Responding to the latest video, Sino Weibo user Pinxieyougong says Mr Bai is ""worth our admiration. We should see more of this [behaviour] across the nation,"" she adds, ""After all, these dogs are civil servants.""
Other users agree, calling the dogs ""national heroes"". One user says they ""should be given a pension"" for the contributions they make to the country.

250,252,"Accident and emergency waiting times for patients have lagged behind other parts of the UK.
Two years ago, a major hospital in Belfast, Royal Victoria, was said to be ""at breaking point"", as a backlog of patients built up and a major incident was declared.
But, even with the latest provisional figures showing a decline in A&E performance, there is a determination among clinicians and nursing staff to draw a line and build a level of service to be proud of.
There is evidence of a change of mood with the opening in August of an emergency department at Royal Victoria, part of a new Â£150m critical care facility.
Doctors, bruised by the turmoil in the 2013-14 winter, have developed new ways of working, designed to speed the flow of patients through the system.
It's early days, but there are some encouraging signs - in recent months, there has been a 10% year-on-year increase in the number of patients treated or assessed within four hours.
The most recent data for November, though, shows an increase of five percentage points year-on-year.
The hospital points out it has dramatically reduced the number waiting 12 hours or more.
A key policy at the Royal Victoria is putting senior clinicians close to the ""front door"" of the emergency department.
Their task is to quickly triage patients and send them through different treatment streams.

Video: How a hospital can grind to a halt
The idea is to avoid a build-up of people waiting in reception.
Badly injured or sick patients are dispatched through the system in the normal way, but a more sophisticated approach has been developed for those who are less seriously ill.
A critical-assessment unit next to the emergency department receives patients, with the aim of dealing with their medical needs within the day.
This could involve an initial appraisal and then sending a patient home for the night with an appointment booked the next day.
Known as a ""virtual ward"", the idea is to carry out treatment without patients needing overnight stays, so reducing pressure on bed occupancy.
Specialist equipment is made available to this unit, allowing doctors to order scans and other procedures to accelerate the patient's progress.
Royal Victoria and other emergency departments are facing deep-rooted pressures.
Northern Ireland does not have a 111 or NHS Direct helpline to guide patients, where appropriate, away from A&E towards other forms of treatment closer to home.
And there are only a few minor injuries clinics to take the pressure off the major hospitals.
The Northern Ireland Health and Social Care Board has announced measures to boost GP out-of-hours services and promote alternatives to turning up at A&E.
The NHS has to cope with long-standing health problems in some areas, including mental health, which can be linked to economic decline and deprivation.
The integration of health and social care offers Northern Ireland the opportunity to tackle major problems common to all parts of the United Kingdom.
Problems caring for the elderly at home and in their local communities have left most UK hospitals struggling to discharge patients and free up beds for new patients to occupy.
Southern Health and Social Care Trust in Northern Ireland is pioneering consultant-led care of the elderly in the community, offering, in effect, hospital care in a patient's own home.
The service aims to treat at home patients with a wider range of acute illnesses.
In its first year, the pilot service has prevented about 440 hospital admissions.
With 1.8 million people, it will always be a challenge for Northern Ireland to sustain a full range of NHS services and specialist care.
There is clearly a will to rise to that challenge, but no-one is denying the task may get harder with rising attendances at hospitals, an ageing population and complex health needs.",The NHS in Northern Ireland has not had a good press in recent years.,35112351,"Despite past challenges, the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast has made improvements in its emergency department waiting times by implementing new ways of working and specialized equipment, but the hospital and the larger healthcare system in Northern Ireland continue to face long-standing pressures and challenges in providing quality care to the population.",0,"Article: {}

""I thought maybe I would stop, then I thought it would be a sabbatical, but now I do not think I will return to coaching,"" Van Gaal was quoted as saying in Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf.
Van Gaal also had spells in charge of Ajax, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and AZ.
He made the announcement on Monday after receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Dutch government for his contribution to football.
He cited family issues for his decision, with De Telegraaf saying it was partly motivated by the sudden death of his daughter's husband last month.
""So much has happened in my family, you become a human being again with your nose pressed to the facts,"" he added.
The Dutchman also revealed he turned down lucrative offers to continue his coaching career in the Far East.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Van Gaal played as a midfielder for Ajax, Royal Antwerp, Telstar, Sparta Rotterdam and AZ between 1972 and 1987 before moving into coaching, first as an assistant at AZ followed by the same role at Ajax.
He replaced Leo Beenhakker as Ajax head coach in 1991 and went on to preside over a period of sustained success, winning the Dutch league title on three occasions as well as the 1992 Uefa Cup and the 1995 Champions League title.
Van Gaal was asked to emulate that success at Spanish giants Barcelona. He inherited Bobby Robson's side in 1997 and led them to two successive La Liga titles and the Copa del Rey.
His country came calling in 2000, but his first stint in charge lasted less than two years when Netherlands failed to qualify for the 2002 World Cup, the first time they had missed the competition since 1986.
The Dutchman's second spell at Barcelona was even shorter - eight months - as he left midway through the season with the club hovering just above the relegation zone.

He then guided AZ Alkmaar to the 2005-06 Eredivisie title before moving to the Bundesliga, where he helped Bayern Munich to the 2009-10 Bundesliga title.
The Dutch national side approached Van Gaal again in 2012 and this time the Netherlands became one of the first two European countries, along with Italy, to qualify for Brazil 2014, where they finished in third place.
After much speculation, he joined United in May 2014, signing a three-year contract to succeed David Moyes.

The money will be distributed to ""community-led"" groups to encourage the building of affordable housing.
Labour's John Healey said last year saw the lowest level of new affordable homes built since 1991.
The government says second-home ownership is at an all-time high and is crowding out first-time buyers by artificially raising prices.
It reports that there were 340,000 second homes in England in 2013/14 - a rise of 98,000 in five years.
In March the then chancellor, George Osborne, announced that £60m raised by an additional 3% on stamp duty on second homes would be spent on ""community-led housing developments in coastal and rural communities"".
The Department for Communities and Local Government said the £60m fund had since been broadened out to include areas with high levels of second homes or where the affordability gap was a particular problem.
It announced that the South West is set to get £19,125,110. This will be split between 25 local authorities in Devon, Cornwall, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Wiltshire, Somerset, Dorset and the Isles of Scilly.
The South East - outside London - will receive the second highest amount, £11,336,157. The East of England will get £8.9m, Yorkshire and Humberside £6.4m and the North-West nearly £6m.
Friday's breakdown also includes £2.3m for London, as well as shares for the East Midlands (£2.7m). West Midlands (£1.9m) and north-east England (£1.3m).
In all, 150 councils will share the money over five years, to be distributed to community-led housing groups to spend on building and the development of house-building skills..
Cornelius Olivier, a Labour councillor in Cornwall, told BBC Radio 5live: ""We have a big problem in Cornwall in that the gap between what people can earn and what housing costs is bigger than almost anywhere else in the country and one of the main reasons is because we have over 10,000 second homes in Cornwall.""
Housing Minister Gavin Barwell said: ""The high number of second homes can be a frustration for many who struggle to find an affordable home in their community.
""This new fund will help tackle that by boosting supply and making sure community groups are at the heart of delivering new homes, so that this is a country that works for everyone.""
During the first year of the scheme, funding will focus on improving skills and reviewing housing needs in different areas.
It ""must then be used to deliver housing on the ground for local people"" during the second year.
But Labour's Mr Healey said: ""Another day, another announcement but still the lowest level of new affordable homes built last year since 1991.

Councillor Martin Tett, for the Local Government Association,

261,263,"If that happens, the ice loss could push up global oceans by 2m, or more.
The claim is based on an assessment of the rocks underlying the ice stream.
Scientists tell the journal Nature that should the front of the glacier retreat about 150km from its current position, it will then enter a runaway reversal that takes it 200-250km further inland.
Most of the big glaciers in the east of the White Continent appear relatively quiescent; Totten is something of an exception.
It is experiencing a thinning rate of about half a metre per year, according to the latest satellite measurements.
Previous research indicates this is probably being driven by warm ocean water getting under and melting the floating front of the glacier.
What Alan Aitken and colleagues have now done is examine a possible future for Totten if the shrinkage continues.
They have used gravity and magnetic data recorded over the entire catchment feeding the glacier to understand its past behaviour.
They find that the underlying sedimentary rocks at the modern front of Totten are heavily eroded, as are the rocks in fjords deep in the interior of the catchment. The inference is that these sections are where persistent, moving ice has had time to grind down the geology.
It is the mid-region, however, that piques the team's interest. Here, the sediments are relatively thick, suggesting that ice fronts have historically been resident in this section for only short periods.
This mid-region is also where the rock bed dips inland - a geometry that glaciologists say is naturally unstable and accelerates any glacier retreat.
""What this all tells us is that once the ice margin starts to go back, it goes back quite rapidly to a newer, stable position way inland. And if you do that our modelling indicates you will lose ice equivalent to 1.5-2m of sea level rise,"" co-author Prof Martin Siegert from Imperial College London, UK, told BBC News.
The last time Totten retreated to the deep interior of the France-sized catchment was probably in the Pliocene Epoch, he added.
""Three-point-five million years ago, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were in the region of 400 parts per million - so about where they are now. The atmosphere was a couple of degrees warmer than it is now, which is in line with what we expect for the end of this century if we do nothing about it. The Pliocene is where we're headed.""
Even so, the timescale for the far retreat inland would be on the order of centuries, on current trends.
The international community has of course committed itself to doing something about climate change, promising at the Paris talks in December to try to keep the global atmospheric temperature rise above pre-industrial levels to ""well below 2C"".
Various analyses, however, suggest a 2.7C increase is a more likely outcome, based on the voluntary national curbs to greenhouse gas emissions promised at the meeting.
And that variance could be significant, according to research presented at the recent European Geosciences Union meeting in Vienna last month.
Prof Rob DeConto from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst, US, has modelled possible ice losses from the Antarctic continent based on the two temperature figures.
For a 2C rise, he found minimal change by the end of this century. On the other hand, for 2.7C he identified ice losses equivalent to many tens of centimetres of sea-level rise.
""There's threshold behaviour in the Antarctic ice sheet system,"" Prof DeConto told reporters at EGU.
""We don't know exactly where that line is, but according to these results somewhere between 2C and 2.7C makes a very big difference.""

262,264,"Portugal international centre-back Alves became Caixinha's first signing as Rangers boss last week.
And McCarthy, who was at Porto when Alves was breaking through, insists he will prove a shrewd capture.
""He'll bring something different to Rangers and beef up their defence, so he's the right defender to bring in,"" McCarthy told BBC Scotland.
""Bruno has a wealth of experience, he's played at the highest level and he's a winner.
""He'll give them a bit more stability at the back, more bite, he's a leader and he'll organise that defence. His communication won't be a problem because his English is very good.
""Bruno is very composed and calm on the ball so he will help the way the manager wants to play things from the back. Bruno is the perfect fit for what the manager is trying to bring to Rangers right now.""
As impressed as McCarthy is by the signing of Alves, he reckons Rangers will have to bring in a few more players of a similar calibre before they will be in a position to seriously challenge Celtic.
Brendan Rodgers' side finished 39 points ahead of the Ibrox outfit as they won the Premiership and went on to secure an unbeaten domestic treble.
""I'm not too sure he'll be able to change that because Celtic are so strong,"" McCarthy said. ""It's going to take more than one Bruno Alves in that Rangers side to take the title from Celtic, but if they sign a couple more players like Bruno, then I think Rangers are in with a shout of giving Celtic a run for their money.""
Alves began his career at Porto and had various loan spells before becoming a first-team regular, winning nine major honour with the Dragons.
He joined Zenit Saint Petersburg for £18m in 2010, with whom he won two league titles and the Russian Super Cup before joining Turkish giants Fenerbahce for £4.5m in 2013.
There he won one league title and the Turkish Super Cup and then in 2016 he moved to Italian Serie A side Cagliari, from whom he joined Rangers.
Part of the Portugal squad that won the European Championships in 2016, Alves has 89 caps for his national side, and McCarthy is convinced the defender has a lot more football left in him, despite being 35 years old.
""He's a fitness fanatic and looks after himself exceptionally well so that will keep him going for a few years,"" he added. ""The experience that he'll bring, Rangers really need it from what I've seen last season.""
And the South African has assured Rangers fans that while Alves is the type of robust defender they need, he will not be a regular in the notebooks of Scotland's referees.
""Everybody has a bit of temper in him but Bruno will choose his moments wisely, he's a senior player in that squad and he has to be an example,"" McCarthy added.
""He can't do silly things that leave the team hanging because they will depend on his experience and to guide the young players. I don't think he'll end up in hot water too many times but he'll bring some fight to that Rangers defence.""",Benni McCarthy says his former Porto team-mate Bruno Alves is the perfect fit for Pedro Caixinha's Rangers.,40143695,"According to former Porto teammate and South African international midfielder McCarthy, Rangers' new signing Bruno Alves will bring stability and leadership to the team's defense, but more signings of a similar caliber will be needed to seriously challenge Celtic for the Premiership title.",0,"Article: {}

Miss Partridge, a zookeeper, died a day later. An inquest recorded her death was the result of an accident.
She died from ""an acute bleed"" as a result of a trauma and suffered a cardiac arrest, the inquest heard.
More on Lily Partridge, and other Devon and Cornwall news
Front row forward Miss Partridge, who was a founder member of the Exonian Ladies team based at Topsham RFC, collapsed at the side of the pitch.
Team captain Katie Lunnon said she saw Miss Partridge walk off the pitch and complain of a headache - but nobody saw the clash with an opponent.
She said: ""I didn't really think anything of it as it was very cold and we were soaked through.
""Lily was kneeling down for a bit and then she said she felt sick and was leaning forward on all fours.""
She said the player then collapsed, and was given CPR when she stopped breathing.
The senior university lecturer added Miss Partridge had suffered two concussions earlier that year, for which she had sought medical attention.
Coroner John Tomalin praised Miss Partridge's parents Jeff and Liz for their ""brave decision"" over her organ donation ""at a time when they were trying to cope with the impending death of their daughter"".
Her parents said they wanted to see rugby players at all levels receive proper treatment for head injuries, including brain scans.
However, an expert who gave evidence at her inquest said two previous concussions Miss Partridge had suffered while playing had not contributed to her death.
In a statement, her parents said: ""Lily loved playing rugby and her dream was to represent Devon. She was the victim of a tragic accident.""
They added she had seen her GP after the previous concussions and followed RFU protocols in not playing for a time afterwards.
They added: ""A brain scan may have spotted any weakness caused by those head injuries.
""If we had known that her life may be in danger by playing rugby again, obviously she would have stopped immediately.
""It is a great game involving big, strong, heavy, fit athletes but we need to make it as safe as possible.
""There are many thousands of girls and women playing rugby and Lily, like us, wants that to continue.""
Consultant radiologist Dr Michael Thomas told the hearing Miss Partridge's two previous rugby concussions were not connected to her death.

267,269,"The key moment was a fumble by Mayo keeper Robert Hennelly early in the second half which gifted Dublin a penalty scored by Diarmuid Connolly.
Hennelly was a late inclusion in place of David Clarke but the move backfired.
Deep in injury-time, Cillian O'Connor missed a difficult free which would have levelled the scores.
Lee Keegan's goal put Mayo ahead midway through the first period but Dublin regrouped to lead 0-10 to 1-6 by half-time.
Hennelly struggled badly with his kick-outs early on with one of his misdirected clearances leading to the black carding of the influential Keegan late in the first half in what was a huge blow for the Connacht county.
Earlier, Dublin's Jonny Cooper was also black carded and a number other players from both sides - notably Dublin's John Small - were fortunate not to suffer the same fate.
In the end, Dublin's stronger bench proved decisive as Cormac Costello came on to kick the champions' three final scores from play.
Cillian O'Connor's ninth point of the contest left the minimum between the teams with three minutes of injury-time left but the Mayo free-taker then missed a high-pressure free from 40 metres which would have levelled the scores again.
As Dublin celebrated back-to-back titles for the first time since the county's triumphs in 1976 and '77, Mayo's players looked crestfallen as they attempted to come to terms with a fifth All-Ireland final defeat in 12 years.
With Hennelly struggling to pick out team-mates from his kick-outs, Dublin moved into a 0-4 to 0-0 lead by the sixth minute which included three Dean Rock points - two of which were from play.
But Mayo were on terms within six minutes after a run of four points started by Patrick Durcan's superb point.
Two Rock frees edged Dublin ahead again but Mayo were suddenly in the lead as the over-lapping Keegan took a perfectly weighted pass from Aidan O'Shea before hammering past Stephen Cluxton from 14 yards.
Cooper's black carding moments later for a hand trip appeared a further boost for Mayo but the Dubs outscored them 0-4 to 0-2 during the remainder of the first period to lead 0-10 to 1-6 at the break.
Mayo regained the lead within two minutes of the restart but were soon three in arrears after another Rock free was followed by Hennelly's howler as he was forced to concede a penalty after spilling a harmless looking ball, with his inevitable black carding followed by Connolly superbly stroking past Clarke.
Mayo cut Dublin's lead to the minimum on four occasions during the remaining half hour of action but their habitual woes of errant shooting and a lack of composure prevented them from getting on terms.
Once again, Aidan O'Shea was not the force that Mayo would have hoped for despite his good work for their first-half goal.

268,270,"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Thursday that the Russian air force would continue its support of the Syrian armed forces.
He also urged Washington to deliver on a pledge to separate moderate Syrian opposition fighters from ""terrorists"".
US Secretary of State John Kerry warned the US was ""on the verge"" of suspending talks with Russia over Syria.
""It's irrational, in the context of the kind of bombing taking place, to be sitting there, trying to take things seriously,"" he told a conference in Washington.
""There is no notion or indication of seriousness of purpose with what is taking place right now.""
The Russian foreign ministry said a US refusal to co-operate would be a gift to ""terrorists"".
The US and Russia have been negotiating for months to try to secure a cessation of hostilities but the latest truce collapsed last week after only a few days and attacks on eastern Aleppo have since intensified.
The US warned on Wednesday it would end talks on military co-operation unless Moscow stopped the bombing.
The recent cessation deal was meant to lead to joint Russian-US air strikes on so-called Islamic State and Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (formerly known as al-Nusra Front).
However Russia has complained the US has not done enough to separate the more moderate rebel groups, which it backs, from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham. Many of these groups have formed a strategic alliance with the more powerful Jabhat Fateh al-Sham and fight alongside it.
Despite growing tensions between the two nations, Mr Peskov said Russia remains interested in pursuing talks with the US in an effort to resolve the crisis in Syria.
His comments echo a statement from Moscow, which insisted it would send diplomats to Geneva to discuss ways of normalising the situation with the US.
US Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Thursday that national security agencies were reviewing all options to try to end the Syrian civil war.
He said President Barack Obama had asked ""all of the agencies to put forward options, some familiar, some new, that we are very actively reviewing"".
""When we are able to work through these in the days ahead we'll have an opportunity to come back and talk about them in detail,"" he said.
Meanwhile Turkey has said it will work with Russia on putting in place another ceasefire after the previous agreement collapsed.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told reporters in Ankara ""we are more than ready"" but emphasised that nations have to try harder to find a political resolution in order for an agreement to be effective.
Aleppo has come under heavy aerial bombardment since the partial truce deal disintegrated a week ago.
Some 250,000 people are trapped in the east in appalling conditions, under siege from Russian-backed Syrian forces.
UN aid chief Stephen O'Brien has warned that Aleppo is facing an unprecedented humanitarian crisis.
Mr O'Brien, the under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, told the UN Security Council Aleppo had descended into a ""merciless abyss of humanitarian catastrophe unlike any we have witnessed in Syria"".

269,271,"After two hours of talks with President Vladimir Putin and Foreign Secretary Sergei Lavrov in Moscow, he said that the ""two foremost nuclear powers cannot have this relationship"".
Although there was some ""common ground"" on Syria, ""broad differences"" remained.
Mr Lavrov said the two sides needed to overcome ""time-bomb issues"" inherited from Barack Obama's administration.
Tensions have risen since a suspected chemical attack on the rebel-held Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun last week that left 89 people dead.
The US and its allies blamed the Syrian government, and the US fired 59 cruise missiles at Syria's Shayrat airbase in response.
Syria denied carrying out the chemical attack and has the support of its main ally, Russia, which on Wednesday vetoed a motion brought to the UN Security Council which would have required Bashar al-Assad's government to co-operate with investigators.
It is the eighth time Moscow has used its veto to protect Syria.
Both Mr Tillerson and Mr Lavrov said the discussions were frank.
Mr Tillerson said: ""I expressed the view that the current state of US-Russia relations is at a low point. There is a low level of trust between our two countries.""
He added: ""We need to attempt to put an end to this steady degradation, which is doing nothing to restore the trust between our two countries or to make progress on the issues of greatest importance to both of us.""
It was a view echoed by President Donald Trump later, who said at a press briefing with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg: ""We may be at an all-time low in terms of our relationship with Russia.""
Mr Trump said ""it would be a fantastic thing"" if the nations improved ties, but warned ""it may be just the opposite"".
Mr Lavrov said a pragmatic conversation was needed to remove the ""irritants that piled up under the Obama administration"".
Both ministers said there was agreement on working towards a stable and unified Syria, and in defeating so-called Islamic State and other terrorist groups.
Both agreed to work towards an international investigation of the chemical attack.
But it was obvious there were many differences.
Mr Tillerson said there was clear evidence that the recent chemical attack ""was planned, directed and executed by Syrian regime forces"".
He said the reign of Bashar al-Assad must end and that Mr Trump's description of the Syrian president as ""an animal"" was ""a characterisation President Assad has brought on himself"".
Mr Lavrov said there was no evidence Syria was behind the chemical attack and pointed to the turmoil that had been brought to other nations when leaders had been removed.
There was little concrete to come from the meeting, although the fact Mr Putin granted Mr Tillerson an audience - which had been in doubt - was a measure of success.
Mr Putin did say he was ready to restore the US-Russia air safety agreement over Syria, and Mr Tillerson said there would be working groups set up on smaller issues.
Ahead of the meeting, Mr Lavrov said Russia had ""a lot of questions regarding very ambiguous and contradictory ideas... coming from Washington"".
Afterwards he said ""we understand each other better"" and there were ""many prospects for co-operation with the US"".
He said there were ""certain time-bomb issues inherited from the previous administration - we know to overcome these obstacles we have to make efforts and that the Americans must move towards us as well"".
Earlier, the US and Russian presidents revealed the wide gulf between them over Syria.
Referring to Mr Assad in a Fox Business Network interview, Mr Trump said: ""Frankly, Putin is backing a person that's truly an evil person... if Russia didn't go in and back this animal, you wouldn't have a problem right now."" He later called Mr Assad a ""butcher"".
Speaking on Mir television, Mr Putin rejected allegations that Syria was behind the chemical attack, saying Syria had given up its chemical stockpile.
He said: ""Where is the proof that Syrian troops used chemical weapons? There isn't any.""
Referring to the US air strike, he said: ""But there was a violation of international law. That is an obvious fact.""
And despite hopes that US-Russia ties would improve under a Trump presidency, Mr Putin said: ""One could say that the level of trust on a working level, especially on the military level, has not improved, but rather has deteriorated.""",US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson says ties with Russia are at a low point and must improve.,39573744,"US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov had a tense meeting in Moscow, with both sides expressing skepticism and mistrust towards each other, and agreeing only on the need for an international investigation into the recent chemical attack in Syria, despite their differences on the issue and the state of US-Russia relations.",0,"Article: {}

Immigration minister Damian Green blamed the last government - but Labour said the report was damning.
The latest report from the inspector focuses on a previously unknown problem in the UKBA, concerning people from outside Europe who have deadlines to leave the UK.
Many of these people are students and if they do not leave when told to do so, they are added to the ""migration refusal pool"" (MRP).
""There are over 150,000 cases nationally of migrants who have been refused an extension of stay in the UK,"" said Mr Vine.
""The Agency does not know how many of these individuals have left the country or are waiting to be removed.
""I also saw no evidence that there is a clear plan in place for the Agency to deal with this stream of work to ensure this does not become another backlog.
""I believe it can and must do more to demonstrate it is dealing with this issue in a more proactive manner.""
The report said the number of MRP cases had grown from 153,000 in October of last year to almost 160,000 by mid-December.
Mr Vine said: ""The Agency needs much more effective planning in place to deal with this stream of work in order to ensure it removes individuals still in the UK who have no right to be here, while setting out clear performance targets to manage these cases much more effectively.""
Immigration Minister Damian Green said ""Under the last government there was no effective strategy in place to ensure migrants left at the end of their time in the UK. The UK Border Agency is now working through a group of potential over-stayers to identify those who have not left.
""This includes checking passenger records using our e-borders database which now covers all flights outside Europe.

271,273,"Waiting times are ""unacceptably high"" and must be top priority, the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) said in a ""manifesto"" ahead of May's assembly election.
The RCS says almost 450,000 patients are waiting for treatment - 10% higher than three years ago.
But the Welsh government said waiting times have been cut since devolution.
Tim Havard, RCS director and a consultant general surgeon, said people are living longer and the NHS is treating more patients than ever before, which ""must be celebrated"".
But he said much more needs to be done to tackle deteriorating waiting times, which could have a ""huge impact on individual patients"".
""The equivalent of one-in-seven Welsh people are awaiting treatment and there is no sign of this improving,"" he said.
""The 26 and 36 week planned surgery targets are not being met. Instances of patients waiting over a year for knee surgery should not be tolerated.""
Mr Havard said despite initiatives, demand continued to grow.
""Many of the causes of high waiting times are complex and will not be solved overnight, but the focus given to tackling high waiting times in heart surgery demonstrates the NHS can improve access when this is made a priority,"" he added.
The RCS wants all parties to prioritise tackling waiting lists in their election manifestos.
The surgeons' organisation had warned back in July 2013 that cardiac patients were dying waiting for surgery in Cardiff and the Vale.
At the time, 279 patients were waiting longer than the six-month target. Now, only around 42 patients have  long waits.
Heart patients from south and west Wales were treated in hospitals in London, Birmingham and at a private hospital in Bristol, to cut the backlog.
Mr Havard also told BBC Wales that operations were being cancelled on a weekly basis, because of the lack of critical care beds.
A recent report for the Welsh government shows Wales has the lowest number of critical care beds in Europe.
Analysis by Owain Clarke, BBC Wales health correspondent.
If patients face delays before surgery not only do they spend longer in pain but their health can deteriorate meaning more risks
The RCS is concerned the problem is being made worse by too many scheduled operations, even major ones, having to be postponed at the last moment because intensive care beds are not available.
A lot been achieved in reducing delays in cardiac surgery, but the RCS argues ""short term"" solutions are no longer adequate - and in my view that is a clear warning to politicians of all parties.
Some specialist hospital services in Wales - the surgeons argue - are spread too thinly and are close to collapse - yet the RCS thinks politicians have been unable or unwilling to make the case for change.
The RCS in its State of Surgery report also called for:
A Welsh government spokesman said: ""We are pleased the Royal College's report recognises people in Wales are living longer thanks to the care they receive from the Welsh NHS, which is treating more patients than ever before.
""This government's top priority is the NHS. Since devolution, waiting times have been cut dramatically. Thanks to our record level of investment in the NHS, today, eight out of 10 patients are waiting less than 26 weeks for treatment, while the average wait at the end of September was just under 11 weeks.""
But the spokesman said an ageing population and ""people's lifestyle choices"" contribute ""significant additional demands"" on the NHS.
""We recognise that waiting times in Wales are too long at present. To tackle this, we have launched the planned care programme to transform the way that services are delivered. A series of plans, designed by clinicians, will help to deliver sustainable services and improve patient experience to ensure patients are seen in the right place, at the right time, by the right person.""
The Welsh Conservatives' Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: ""This is yet more evidence that Welsh patients are getting a raw deal.
""In England, just 6% of the population is on a waiting list. Here, it's 15% - one in seven. That's a national scandal.""

The Melton Fields project would have consisted of 510 houses and a care home. The company also applied for permission for an alternative smaller scheme of 390 homes.

VW cars which are three years old, or have done 36,000 miles, are typically worth 42.21% of their original value, the magazine said.
That is 2.7% lower than in September 2015, just before the scandal broke.
However, across the industry as a whole, second hand values have fallen by 2% over the same timeframe, suggesting that Volkswagens have performed only slightly worse than the average car on the market.
""I'm sure there are motorists out there who were rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of used VW prices falling off a cliff because of the emissions debacle,"" said What Car? editor Steve Huntingford.
""That simply hasn't come to pass, however, and while the VW story continues to rumble on a year after the story first came to light, the Golf and Polo are still among the most popular new cars in the UK.""
The German car-maker admitted on 16 September last year that software had switched diesel engines to a ""clean mode"" whenever they were tested for emissions.
VW has recalled 200,000 cars in the UK as a result.
But while it is offering to repair them, it is not offering owners compensation.
VW drivers in the US have been offered up to $10,000 each to make up for the deception.
The What Car? research suggested that cars made by VW under the Audi brand experienced a similar drop in value to VW-badged cars over the past year.
It also found that the value of second hand Seat and Skoda models, also made by the VW group, fell by less than 0.5% over the 12-month period.","Second hand Volkswagens appear to be holding their value well, a motoring magazine says, despite the emissions scandal which emerged a year ago.",37338972,"Sure!

On Friday, CIA officials told US media they had concluded that Russians hackers were trying to help Mr Trump.
Russian officials have repeatedly denied the hacking accusations.
Mr Trump said it might have been Russia but it was impossible to know.
""They have no idea if it's Russia or China or somebody sitting in a bed some place,"" he said.
President Barack Obama has ordered a complete review of the hacks, which targeted emails at the Democratic Party and the emails of a key aide to presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.
The contents of the emails, passed to Wikileaks and posted online, were embarrassing to the Democrats and shook up the presidential campaign.
Senior Republicans have now joined Democrats in calling for a full investigation.
Republican Senator John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a joint statement on Sunday with top Democrats that the CIA's report ""should alarm every American"".
He said in an interview that the congressional investigation should be more thorough than the one ordered by the White House.
In October, US government officials pointed the finger at Russia, accusing it of meddling in the campaign to undermine the electoral process.
But on Friday, the intelligence community went further when US media reports said the CIA had ""high confidence"" that Russians were trying to influence the election in Mr Trump's favour.
Russians had hacked the Republican party but chose not to reveal the contents of what they found, the reports said.
But Mr Trump told Fox News Sunday: ""I think it's ridiculous. I think it's just another excuse. I don't believe it.""
He said the Democrats were behind the news reports, not the CIA, because they suffered such a big defeat.
While backing the Obama review, the president-elect warned that it should not pin the blame solely on Russia but on other countries or individuals too.
Republican party spokesman Sean Spicer said the party had not been hacked and the intelligence report was wrong.
Mr Trump also said in the interview he did not need daily intelligence briefings.
""I'm a smart person, I don't need to be told the same thing in the same way for eight years.""
Elsewhere in the interview, he said:

Among SNP sources, the chatter was that she would give an ultimatum to Theresa May that if she could not negotiate a differentiated Brexit deal for Scotland she would push for a second independence referendum.
Forget that. Scotland's first minister has gone the whole hog, saying she will next week push the button on a second independence referendum by putting legislation to the Scottish Parliament.
Sturgeon can probably win that in Holyrood, but can she win the referendum?
Her announcement will delight her many many supporters.
She is undoubtedly a hugely effective and talented politician. During the last referendum, the SNP's support grew very significantly and they managed to enthuse many thousands of new members to their cause.

285,287,"They found that targeting a part of the brain called the parietal lobe improved the ability of volunteers to solve numerical problems.
They hope the discovery could help people with dyscalculia, who may struggle with numbers.
Another expert said effects on other brain functions would need checking.
The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology.
Some studies have suggested that up to one in five people have trouble with maths, affecting not just their ability to complete problems but also to manage everyday activities such as telling the time and managing money.
Neuroscientists believe that activity within the parietal lobe plays a crucial role in this ability, or the lack of it.
When magnetic fields were used in earlier research to disrupt electrical activity in this part of the brain, previously numerate volunteers temporarily developed discalculia, finding it much harder to solve maths problems.
The latest research goes a step further, using a one milliamp current to stimulate the parietal lobe of a small number of students.
The current could not be felt, and had no measurable effect on other brain functions.
As it was turned on, the volunteers tried to learn a puzzle which involved substituting numbers for symbols.
Those given the current from right to left across the parietal lobe did significantly better when given, compared to those who were given no electrical stimulation.
The direction of the current was important - those given stimulation running in the opposite direction, left to right, did markedly worse at these puzzles than those given no current, with their ability matching that of an average six-year-old.
The effects were not short-lived, either. When the volunteers whose performance improved was re-tested six months later, the benefits appear to have persisted.
There was no wider effect on general maths ability in either group, just on the ability to complete the puzzles learned as the current was applied.
Dr Cohen Kadosh, who led the study, said: ""We are not advising people to go around giving themselves electric shocks, but we are extremely excited by the potential of our findings and are now looking into the underlying brain changes.
""We've shown before that we can induce dyscalculia, and now it seems we might be able to make someone better at maths, so we really want to see if we can help people with dyscalculia.

""Electrical stimulation is unlikely to turn you into the next Einstein, but if we're lucky it might be able to help some people to cope better with maths.""
Dr Christopher Chambers, from the School of Psychology at Cardiff University, said that the results were ""intriguing"", and offered the prospect not just of improving numerical skills, but having an impact on a wider range of conditions.
He said: ""The ability to tweak activity in parts of the brain, turning it slightly 'up' or 'down' at will, opens the door to treating a range of psychiatric and neurological problems, like compulsive gambling or visual impairments following stroke.""
However, he said that the study did not prove that the learning of maths skills was improved, just that the volunteers were better at linking arbitrary numbers and symbols, and he warned that researchers needed to make sure other parts of the brain were unaffected.
""This is still an exciting new piece of research, but if we don't know how selective the effects of brain stimulation are then we don't know what other brain systems could also be affected, either positively or negatively.""
Sue Flohr, from the British Dyslexia Association, which also provides support for people with dyscalculia, said the research was welcome.
She said: ""It's certainly an under-recognised condition, but it can ruin lives.

Mr Duterte's outburst came after at a press conference where he told reporters he would not accept Mr Obama raising any concerns about the war on drugs in the Philippines.
""You must be respectful. Do not just throw away questions and statements. Son of a whore, I will curse you in that forum,"" Mr Duterte said, apparently in reference to the US president.

Mrs May noted Sir Tony Robinson, who played Baldrick, was a Labour member.
Sir Tony later described the pair as ""a beardy man and a grumpy lady"".
During Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Corbyn and Mrs May argued over the government's yet-to-be-announced stance for when negotiations for leaving the European Union begin next year.
The Labour leader accused the prime minister of presiding over a ""shambolic Tory Brexit"" and called for clarity and warned of the effect of it might have on the Irish border.
Mrs May pledged no return to the ""borders of the past"", saying a Common Travel Area had existed since 1923, and accused Mr Corbyn of trying to ""frustrate the will of the British people"" over the EU referendum.
The government has said it will formally trigger Brexit talks by the end of next March, but has consistently refused to offer a ""running commentary"" on its negotiating stance.
Prime Minister's Questions took an unusual turn when Mr Corbyn made reference to Baldrick, the turnip-loving and intellectually challenged servant to Rowan Atkinson's 1980s historical comedy character Edmund Blackadder.
He said: ""When you're searching for the real meaning and the importance behind the prime minister's statement (on the recent European Council summit), you have to consult the great philosophers.
""The only one I could come up with is Baldrick, who says, 'Our cunning plan is to have no plan.""'

Mrs May responded: ""I'm interested that you chose Baldrick. Of course, the actor playing Baldrick was a member of the Labour Party, as I recall.""
Sir Tony is a long-serving activist who has chaired proceedings at the party's annual conference - he has also been a recent critic of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.

296,298,"She told The Sun her three rivals were all ""continuity Miliband"" candidates who would not connect with aspirational low and middle income voters.
It come as another contender, Yvette Cooper, sets out a plan to create two million high tech jobs.
Ms Cooper, Ms Kendall, Andy Burnham and Jeremy Corbyn will take part in a leadership hustings later.
The four MPs are vying to succeed Mr Miliband as Labour leader, with the result of the election to be announced in early September.
The campaign so far has been dominated by the candidates' attitudes to Labour's election defeat and how far they are willing to distance themselves from the policies put forward by Mr Miliband.
Claims by Ms Kendall and her supporters that only she would break from the past have led to a war of words between their rival camps.
In an interview with the Sun, Ms Kendall said she made no apology for calling for a complete change of approach, claiming that ""if we stick with what we have been saying for the last five or eight years, we will have the same result"".
""I think I am the only person in this race that isn't continuity Miliband,"" she said. ""The other candidates haven't spelled out how they would be different from Ed Miliband.""
In a direct appeal to readers of the Sun, which was highly critical of Mr Miliband's leadership, Ms Kendall said Labour needed to show it could be trusted with people's money and had more to say to homeowners and those who run their own business.
""We have got to get back to the values of the British people - work, responsibility, wanting to get on, wanting to be a success, and being proud of that - not making people ashamed or think somehow that they are doing something wrong.""
During a campaign visit to the University of Manchester, Ms Cooper will argue that Britain is being ""left behind"" as a country, with its spending on research and development and science lagging behind that of other comparable European economies.
Even when major scientific discoveries are made in the UK, such as with graphene - a material that has been been touted as having the scope to transform electronics - she said the UK has often been slow to exploit their commercial potential.
Acknowledging that Labour's relationship with business is in ""real need of recovery"", she said a future Labour government must aspire to spend 3% of the UK's national output on science and R&D to bring it into line with the likes of Germany.
Such a financial commitment, backed by a 10-year plan, was needed to create two million high-skilled manufacturing jobs, she said.
""Britain can't compete with Brazil or Indonesia on low-wage, low-skills jobs,"" she said.
""But with high-skilled jobs in emergent technologies, in the harnessing of new technologies such as graphene, we can do what we've done before: punch well above our weight as a small island off the coast of Europe. That should be Labour's mission.""
All small businesses, she argued, should have guaranteed access to high-speed broadband since the digital economy was crucial to Britain's future long-term competitiveness.
Stressing that Labour must be the champion of innovation as the route to greater productivity, she recalled Harold Wilson's famous prediction in 1963 that a new Britain would be forged in the ""white heat"" of a scientific revolution.
""Just as Labour championed the white heat of technology in the 1960s, so today we need to champion the white flashing constellations of the networked world"".
The Conservatives have pledged to spend 2.5% of GDP on science and R&D by 2020 while Chancellor George Osborne has said Manchester will be heart of a northern powerhouse, underpinned by investment in world-class science and research facilities.

Back at the bird reserve, the mood changed slightly as the day dawned, the birds started singing and the winter sun struggled to pierce the hazy clouds.
The media were now at the gate in force and the men there were more reluctant to talk.
""We need to stick to the narrative,"" one told us as he explained why we needed to wait for their leader Ammon Bundy.
Down a slight hill, we could now see the headquarters clearly, the red roofs of the sheds standing out against the snow.
Several dark-clad figures moved around in the complex.
At the top of a metal observation tower two men surveyed the surroundings.
There was not much for them to see apart from satellite trucks, camera crews and a solitary, unexplained drone.
For miles around there was no sign at all of any law enforcement officers although the word in Burns, some 30 minutes away, is that the hotels are packed with FBI agents.
Critics of this occupation are putting pressure on the federal authorities to enforce the law and end it. They have accused the occupiers of this building of being domestic terrorists, using force to impose their will.
Those involved insist they are patriots and they claim they have the law on their side. The US constitution prohibits the federal government from owning this land, they say.
When Mr Bundy emerged to speak to the media he refused to tell me how many people were inside the bird sanctuary or how many were armed but, after the news conference, camera crews were given a limited tour of the site.
Several children also came along although the militia men said the youngsters were visitors who were not staying on the site.
We were told we would not be shown anything relating to ""operational security"" or anything that would ""put lives at risk"" and, indeed, we were kept away from any weapons on the site.
A number of US government vehicles sat in the car park, covered in snow.
We were not allowed into most of the buildings and saw no more than a dozen men and one woman inside.
We were taken into a building where one of the protestors said he had been sleeping. It appeared to be a gym for the federal employees who usually manage this land.
There were cans of chicken noodle soup, oranges, apples and other food.
Through a glass window we could see a man and a woman cooking food in a kitchen. The site appeared to be in good condition.
Not all of the men here were keen to talk but those who were have urged supporters to take up arms and join them to assert the rights of ranchers in the American west, rights which they say have been trampled by a federal government over-reaching its authority.
They say they are prepared to stay here for years to make that point and, so far, there is no sign at all of them leaving or being forced from this land.

The first carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is expected to be operational in 2020.
""We are going to see a bigger Royal Navy and the flagship... will be here in Portsmouth,"" Michael Fallon said.
The 60 Pacific 24 rigid-hulled inflatable boats will be built by BAE systems to ""guard the carriers in the harbour and our new frigates and destroyers"", Mr Fallon said.
He said they will also enhance security by providing a rapid response in rescue, anti-piracy and counter-narcotics missions in the area.
Mr Fallon said: ""Through the defence review, defence spending is going to go up every April for the rest of this parliament.
He said as part of the larger investment, the government will also be able to provide the new aircraft carriers with sufficient fighter jets.
""We have said we will maintain a minimum fleet of 19 destroyers and frigates, but as the older frigates are retired we also hope to add a lighter frigate between the offshore patrol vessel and Type 26 and to build more of those as well.""
Mr Fallon's visit to Portsmouth Naval Base comes as work has begun to rebuild the jetty for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth in 2017.
Floating cranes are also dredging Portsmouth harbour to prepare deeper channels for the aircraft carriers to sail from the base, which are the largest ships ever built for the Royal Navy.
""This is a huge financial investment in making sure the channel is wide enough, in enlarging the jetty here so they can take the carriers and in making sure the carriers are properly guarded,"" Mr Fallon said.
Taller than Nelson's Column and longer than Portsmouth's Spinnaker Tower laid on its side, the new carriers will displace 65,000 tonnes of water.

Orient edged the opening exchanges but lost defender Tom Parkes through injury before Steven Alzate was denied on the edge of the area by keeper Glenn Morris.
Crawley had failed to score in their previous three home games but leading marksman James Collins swooped to give them the lead with his 20th goal of the season midway through the half.
The former Shrewsbury striker struck by heading in a free-kick from Josh Payne and, although keeper Sam Sargeant got a hand to the ball, it flew into the corner of the net.
Crawley took a firm grip of the game by scoring twice in the space of four minutes before the interval.
Defender Joe McNerney rose unchallenged to head home a Payne free-kick from 12 yards on 29 minutes and then, from an Andre Blackman set-piece, Dutch midfielder Enzio Boldewijn forced the ball home.
Crawley, who had won only two of their previous 13 games, threatened again when a header from skipper Jimmy Smith was saved by Sargeant shortly after the break.
Boldewijn, after earlier firing wide from 25 yards, should have increased the lead when putting the ball wastefully wide from a pass by Collins.

308,310,"Maya Kodnani, an ex-minister and aide to Chief Minister Narendra Modi, is the most senior figure so far convicted.
Thirty others received life sentences for their part in the killings in Naroda Patiya, a suburb of Ahmedabad.
The riots left more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, dead, and were among India's worst outbreaks of unrest.
The rioting began after 60 Hindu pilgrims died in a train fire blamed on Muslims in the town of Godhra.
Kodnani was not a minister at the time of the riots, but was appointed junior minister for women and child development by Mr Modi in 2007.
She quit her post when she was arrested in 2009 in connection with the massacre but remained a member of the state assembly.
On Wednesday she was convicted of murder, attempted murder and conspiracy. Thirty-one others were also found guilty of involvement in the case. One of those convicted has never been brought to justice and was tried in absentia.
Babu Bajrangi, a former leader of the hardline Hindu group Bajrang Dal, was found guilty on the same charges as Kodnani. He has been sentenced to remain in jail until he dies.
Announcing the sentences on Friday, Judge Jyotsna Yagnik named Kodnani as ""a kingpin of riots"" in the Naroda Patiya area.
""Communal riots are like cancer on constitutional secularism and the incident in Naroda Patiya was a black chapter in the history of the Indian constitution,"" the Press Trust of India quoted him as saying.
""Acts of communal [religious] violence are brutal, inhuman and shameful. It was a clear incident of human rights violation as 97 people were killed brutally within a day which included helpless women, children, aged persons.
""The climax of this inhuman and brutal act of violence was reflected in [the] murder of an infant, who was 20 days old,"" the judge said.
Following Kodnani's conviction on Wednesday, Gujarat's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government quickly distanced itself from her saying that she had not been a state minister at the time of the riots.
Correspondents, however, say her conviction is an embarrassment for Mr Modi who elevated her to ministerial office in 2007 despite being aware that her role in the riots was being investigated.
Gujarat assembly elections are due later in the year and the Congress party is bound to use the court ruling to criticise Mr Modi during the campaign.
Mr Modi, touted by some as a future prime minister, has been accused of not doing anything to stop the riots - a charge he has always denied.
Ninety-five bodies were found after the Naroda Patiya massacre - the worst of the Gujarat riots cases - on 28 February 2002. The bodies of two other people missing after the massacre and presumed dead were never found.
The trial began in August 2009 and charges were brought against 62 people. One of the accused died during the trial.

309,311,"Tumours can ""seed"" themselves elsewhere in the body and this process is behind 90% of cancer deaths.
The mouse study, published in Nature, showed altering the immune system slowed the spread of skin cancers to the lungs.
Cancer Research UK said the early work gave new insight into how tumours spread and may lead to new treatments.
The spread of cancer - known as metastasis - is a fight between a rapidly mutating cancer and the rest of the body.
The team at the Sanger Institute in Cambridge was trying to figure out what affected tumour spread in the body.
Researchers created 810 sets of genetically modified lab mice to discover which sections of the DNA were involved in the body resisting a cancer's spread.
The animals were injected with melanomas (skin cancer) and the team counted the number of tumours that formed in the lung.
Their hunt led them to discover 23 sections of DNA, or genes, that made it either easier or harder for a cancer to spread.
Many of them were involved in controlling the immune system.
Targeting one gene - called Spns2 - led to a three-quarters reduction in tumours spreading to the lungs.
""It regulated the balance of immune cells within the lung,"" Dr David Adams, one of the team, told the BBC News website.
""It changes the balance of cells that play a role in killing tumour cells and those that switch off the immune system.""
The field of immunotherapy - harnessing the power of the immune system to fight cancer - has delivered dramatic results for some patients.
A rare few with a terminal diagnosis have seen all signs of cancer disappear from their body, although the drugs still fail to work in many patients.
Dr Adams said: ""We've learnt some interesting new biology that we might be able to use - it's told us this gene is involved in tumour growth.""
Drugs that target Spns2 could produce the same cancer-slowing effect but that remains a distant prospect.
Dr Justine Alford, from Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study in mice gives a new insight into the genes that play a role in cancer spreading and may highlight a potential way to treat cancer in the future.
""Cancer that has spread is tough to treat, so research such as this is vital in the search for ways to tackle this process.""

313,315,"When he was growing up in the 1960s, vegetable oil was still a precious commodity and used sparingly.
Fast-forward to today and oil is now so abundant and cheaply available that most of us use it liberally in our cooking - chucking it in anything from salad dressings to deep fat frying.
It's not only in our home cooking, oil is also an ingredient in most of the items we buy from the supermarket.
In fact, vegetable oil, specifically soy bean oil and palm oil, are two of the eight ingredients, alongside wheat, rice, maize, sugar, barley and potato, that are now estimated to provide a staggering 85% of the world's calories.
Increasingly, no matter what country we live in, we all eat similar diets which are heavy in calories and low in nutrients.
It's a development that Prof Benton, a strategic research dean at the University of Leeds specialising in food security and sustainability, links directly to global trade.
The production of vegetable oils and oil crops have both increased considerably over the past three decades.
The rise has been  driven by a combination of trade agreements, which have made it cheaper and easier to export and import oil, and various government policies. Policy incentives in countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, aimed at ramping up production for export, have helped to lower the cost of vegetable oil, for example.
""Competing in a global market requires a highly efficient production process driving scale and cheapness. Now we have a food system built on incredibly cheap calories,"" says Prof Benton.
Of course, this food trade has in many cases helped reduce famine and, as Prof Benton points out, means the ""poorest of poor have access to cheap calories"".
But he says this trade - which means more people are eating less healthy imports, rather than what is locally available - may also have helped to make us fatter.
Over 50% of the world's population is not of a ""healthy weight"", according to Prof Benton's recent report on food production. And worldwide obesity has more than doubled since 1980.
""The poorest anywhere still struggle to get sufficient calories and are underweight, but in our rich countries, poverty often does not stop people being able to eat (and drink) calories, but it does stop them having a nutrient-rich diet,"" the report says.
Prof Corinna Hawkes, director of the Centre for Food Policy at City, University of London, says the greatest increase in sources of calories since the globalisation era began, has come from oil crops.
""There was a very sudden and marked increase in the availability of soybean and palm oil and that to me is directly related with policies that made it easier to trade,"" she says.
Oilseeds are now among the most widely traded crops, and most processed foods contain either palm oil or soybean oil, which can help extend shelf life, she says.
""Because it became much easier and cheaper for the processed food industry to import it there was no disincentive for using it,"" she says.
A small amount of fat is an essential part of a healthy, balanced diet. But fats are high in calories so eating a lot can increase the risk of becoming overweight or obese. Saturated and trans fats are also associated with heart disease.
Prof Hawkes says that the low cost and availability of oil has meant some countries' cooking habits have changed. In China, for example, food is deep fried in high quantities of oil and in Brazil, people use larger amounts of oil in traditional dishes.
But alongside the increased trade of oil crops, she says, it's important to note that trade in fruit and vegetables has also increased, meaning many people's diets have actually improved.
This discrepancy is what Prof Hawkes calls the ""quinoa question"". Increasing western demand for the so-called ""superfood"", which has been grown high in the Andes for thousands of years, has been blamed for its skyrocketing price and unavailability for people in the countries it first came from.
The question goes to the heart of the controversy surrounding globalisation: that its rise has disproportionately benefited people who are already advantaged.
So while people clued-up on nutrition and health may be getting healthier thanks to global trade, those without this knowledge have seen their diet deteriorate.
However, the findings of a recent study by the London School of Economics (LSE), which looked at 26 countries between 1989 and 2005 when globalisation dramatically expanded, contradict this.
The research concluded that ""social globalisation"" - changes in the way we work and live - was what was making us fat, rather than the wider availability of cheaper and more calorific foods driven by global trade.
Basically, the fact that we are are now increasingly able to work, shop and socialise whilst barely moving a muscle is to blame, says study author Dr Joan Costa-Font.
""Our food intake is driven towards meeting the needs of a pre-global [socially speaking] world, where people would have to walk to places, and where there would not be as many energy-saving activities as today. Individuals would have closer personal social contacts, and would cook and spend more time on daily chores,"" he says.
Dr Costa-Font says the research suggests that once people adapt their diet and lifestyle to these changes - basically move more and eat less - more normal weights will again prevail.
He points to the US as an example. While obesity levels are alarmingly high at almost 35%, he notes that this level has stayed pretty much the same over the past decade.
""That's good news. That's already something.
""It may be that the US is beginning to start to learn how to eat and adjust its lifestyle to a global one. The hypothesis is that this rise in obesity is only transitory.""","A teaspoon of oil, measured out with precision, is how Professor Tim Benton remembers his mother preparing items for frying.",39254804,"The increased availability and affordability of vegetable oils due to global trade has led to a significant shift in the world's diet, with more people consuming more calories and becoming overweight or obese, but it's not just about the food, the way we live and work has also contributed to the rise in obesity.",0,"Article: {}

316,318,"They were made 110 years ago by the Wall family who lived in New Southgate in North London.
There are 24 clear recordings on wax cylinders which were made using a phonograph machine between 1902 and 1917.
Music curators say the sound quality of the music recorded is outstanding.
The recordings were found at the former home of David Brown, Cromwell Wall's grandson, in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire and donated to St Neot's Museum. It was then discovered that the recordings were made in London.
Cromwell Wall's great-great grandchildren, Layla and Zac Jordan, from Sandy in Bedfordshire, heard the recordings for the first time when they visited the Museum of London.
Cromwell and Minnie Wall had nine children, eight of whom appear on the recordings. All the recordings are bursting with vibrancy and life, according to Julia Hoffbrand who is the curator at the Museum of London who helped restore the recordings.
""When I first heard the recordings the hairs on my arms stood on end,"" she said. ""It was fantastic. We had an idea of what was on the recordings because Cromwell had written very full descriptions on the cylinder boxes but it was really like a window opening into the past. It was like being in the same room as the family and their friends"".
Many of the recordings were made at family gatherings over Christmas and New Year.
Cromwell Wall, who made the recordings, wheeled the phonograph along the streets in his children's pram in order to record the sound of Old Southgate Church bells pealing out New Year.
Some of the later recordings were made during WWI when three of the sons, who feature in earlier recordings were away at war. One son, Oliver, died of pneumonia in a French hospital three weeks before peace was declared.
The recordings were restored this summer and many of the relatives heard them for the first time in October. It brought back some great memories for Oliver Wall, one of Cromwell's grandchildren.
""It was a wonderful atmosphere. I remember the occasions always at Christmas and we always had big parties and singing round the piano with grandpa playing and he used to take us marching upstairs and all over the big house they had.""
His cousin Daphne reminisces how their grandfather used to dress up as Father Christmas.
""There was a great deal of excitement,"" she said. ""It was fun!""
It is very unusual for recordings on wax phonograph cylinders to survive for so long. Phonographs were introduced for use in offices as dictating machines and so it is extremely rare for them to be used to record domestic sounds and occasions.
""We were thrilled,"" says Julia Hoffbrand. ""Phonographs and cylinders were expensive so you had to have a certain level of income to record and a level of skill and care to make recordings and to take care of the cylinders.""
The cylinders themselves are similar to old fashioned vinyl records in that the phonograph would make indentations into the cylinder which could then be replayed.  Bill Lowry, digital collections manager at the Museum was among those who helped restore the cylinders.
""We tried to reduce any noise by cleaning the cylinder first with a fine brush that can get in between the groove and once we had the best playback from the cylinder we then digitally cleaned them up.""

Cardiff Crown Court heard the group was arrested as part of one of the largest undercover operations in Wales.
Four were convicted after trial, while six others pleaded guilty to their part in the conspiracy from 2013-2014.
Arrests were made after police seized 40kg (88lbs) of the drug in 2014.
Most was found inside a speaker and a suitcase in a car stopped on the M5, while a smaller amount was discovered in the footwell of a taxi in Newport.
Officers said the seizure had prevented half a million drug deals, the court heard.

Earlier this year, 10-year-old Ying Ying mated naturally and was also artificially inseminated.
However, the staff at Ocean Park are unsure which method has resulted in the successful pregnancy.
Ying Ying was sent to mainland China's Sichuan province this spring to take part in a breeding programme.
The 100kg female - described by the park as ""inquisitive, active and vigilant"" - attempted to mate naturally with two male pandas on five different occasions and one of the attempts was deemed successful.

Overall in 2015 house prices rose by 4.5%, with the average price of a property in the UK now at Â£196,999.
Separately the Land Registry for England and Wales reported that prices rose by 5.6% in the year to November. It said the average price of a house or flat was Â£186,325.
Nationwide said the growth in house prices broadly matched growth in average salaries, adding that it expected to see a similar pace of growth next year.
Rival lender Halifax calculates that prices are rising twice as fast.
Its most recent survey suggested that prices went up by 9% in the year to November.
London remained the strongest performing region for the fifth year running, with average prices up 12% compared with a year ago, according to Nationwide.
But it did not expect house prices in the capital to continue to see above average growth next year, pointing to the fact that property was becoming unaffordable for many in the city.
Average prices in the London are now 50% above their pre-crisis peak in 2007, while in contrast property values in Northern Ireland remain 44% below their pre-crisis peak, despite rising by 6.5% in the last three months of the year.
Across the UK as a whole, prices are around 7% higher, Nationwide added.
Scotland was the only part of the UK that saw a fall in average house prices, with values down 1.9% in the three months to the end of December compared with the same period a year ago.
Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist, forecast average house prices would accelerate at a modest pace, despite the likelihood of interest rate rises from the middle of next year.
""Further healthy gains in employment and rising wages are likely to bolster buyer sentiment, while borrowing costs are expected to rise only gradually. However, the main concern is that construction activity will lag behind strengthening demand, putting upward pressure on house prices and eventually reducing affordability,"" he added.
Overall, Mr Gardner forecast average house price growth of between 3% and 6% nationally in 2016.
He also raised concerns about regional variations in house prices, linking strong house price growth in some regions to higher rates of employment growth.

The UN did not explain why the project with Wonder Woman, announced in October, would end on Friday.
But spokesman Jeffrey Brez said campaigns using fictional characters often lasted no longer than a few months, Reuters news agency reported.

Warner Bros and DC Entertainment are supporting a year-long campaign by the UN and its children's agency, Unicef, for gender equality and women's empowerment.
In the petition against the character's appointment, opponents said the image she projected was ""not culturally encompassing or sensitive"".

City should have gone ahead through Scotland's Jane Ross, but she hesitated after rounding the Brondby goalkeeper.
The Danish side host the second leg on Wednesday, 16 November.
Facing an organised Brondby outfit who have reached the semi-finals on three occasions, City struggled to create chances in the first half but right-back Lucy Bronze did force a good low save from visiting keeper Katrine Abel.
The hosts could have gone behind, but England stopper Karen Bardsley was alert to produce a low, one-handed save to deny Nanna Christiansen.
After half-time the energetic Ross raced clear and calmly rounded Abel, but, with the goal gaping, defender Simone Sorensen had time to recover and intercept the danger.
As City began to dominate, England Under-19 international Walsh produced the game's finest moment, finding the far corner with a crisp effort from outside the area which capped another excellent individual performance in the holding role.
City, who won a domestic double in 2016 by adding the Continental Cup to their maiden league title, have now kept 20 clean sheets in 26 matches in all competitions this year.
Brondby pushed for an away goal late on but Bardsley tipped away Veje Katrine's curling effort in the closing stages - a save which could prove crucial.
City manager Nick Cushing was full of praise for young star Walsh after the game, hailing her as one of the best midfielders in the FA Women's Super League.
""I'm glad she scored because I think her performances have been up there with the best, if not the best, players in the league,"" he told BBC Sport.
""She's been one of our key performers consistently.

Universities will be asked to publicly justify how they can pay their heads more than the prime minister.
The question of university value has been under scrutiny, with fees increasing to £9,250 in England.
In a speech to university leaders on Thursday, Mr Johnson will call for universities to set out much clearer contracts for students on what they can expect.
He will promise better ""consumer protection"" for students.
An annual study has shown a decreasing sense of value for money among students - with concerns about getting fewer teaching hours than they expected.
Mr Johnson will highlight concerns over increases in vice-chancellors' pay - with dozens of university heads now receiving over £300,000 and some being paid more than £400,000.
""When students and taxpayers invest so heavily in our higher education system, value for money should be guaranteed.  Yet, I am still hearing students say that their course is poor quality.
""This is not good enough, especially when some vice-chancellors take home a wage that in some cases exceeds that of the prime minister.""
There have been concerns about the rising costs of university in England - with tuition fees increasing to £9,250 and interest rates on loans rising to 6.1%.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies says that average debts for graduates will now be over £50,000 - and that interest charges will have reached £5,800 before students have even graduated.
Former education minister Lord Adonis says such high levels of interest are ""indefensible"" and predicts that they will be changed.
And the head of the Russell Group of leading universities has described such interest charges as ""out of touch"" and called for them to be reviewed.

The main contributor to growth was streaming, but vinyl revenues rose by more than two thirds.
However, more revenues could be generated by platforms such as Youtube, the BPI said.
Revenue from physical formats dipped below £300m last year, but remained just above the £274m generated by streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and Deezer.
Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI and the Brit Awards, said the increase in revenues was encouraging, as more and more consumers enjoyed the benefits of subscribing to a streaming service or rediscovered the joys of vinyl.
""Britain's world-leading music sector has the potential for sustained growth in the years ahead, but this exciting future can only be realised if government makes creative businesses a priority post-Brexit,"" he added.
UK artists needed to be able to tour freely in EU markets, and UK businesses needed to be able to employ the best talent, Mr Taylor argued.
He added that strong intellectual property protections would need to be included in trade talks with third party countries.

""We will in due course explore all options in the design of future trade agreements, including the role of intellectual property rights in boosting UK exports in overseas markets.""

327,329,"Some two dozen behemoths were identified, all with masses in excess of a hundred times that of the Sun.
Four were known previously, including the remarkable colossus catalogued as R136a1, which is 250 times as massive as our home star.
But the new survey finds many more of the super-objects in a tight patch of sky within the Large Magellanic Cloud.
""In just a tiny bit of this satellite galaxy, we see perhaps a couple of dozen stars with more than a 100 solar masses, of which nine are in a tight core just a few light-years across,"" explained Prof Paul Crowther from Sheffield University, UK.
""But that two dozen number - that's probably more than are in the entire Milky Way Galaxy for this type of star,"" he told BBC News.
The observations are to be published shortly in the Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society.
They build on earlier work reported in 2010 that first described R136a1 - the most massive and most luminous star identified to date.
That study used data gathered principally by a ground-based telescope in Chile.
This follow-up research employed the pin-sharp resolution and ultraviolet sensitivity of the orbiting Hubble telescope to tease out yet more detail.
In 2010, astronomers saw four monster stars including R136a1 in the central core. Thanks to Hubble, they detect a further five.
The stars are not only extremely massive, but they are also extremely bright. Together, these nine stars outshine our Sun by a factor of 30 million, said Prof Crowther.
""Because they are so massive, they are all close to their so-called Eddington limit, which is the maximum luminosity a star can have before it rips itself apart; and so they've got really powerful outflows. They are shedding mass at a fair rate of knots,"" the astronomer added - up to an Earth mass of gaseous material per month.
The question is why this tight corner of space, located in the Tarantula Nebula of the LMC, harbours so many giants.
Prof Crowther thinks it is because the gas and dust in the region has become compressed as the Large Magellanic Cloud has skirted the edge of the Milky Way. One thing is for sure - none of these monster stars will be around for more than a few million years. To burn so bright is to burn briefly.
""A lot of these stars will be in binaries (in pairs), and when they die they'll produce black holes, which will merge at some point in the dim and distant future. And when they do they'll produce gravitational waves.
""The first detection of gravitational waves [reported by Advanced LIGO last month] was from the merger of a pair of 30-solar-mass black holes. They probably came from 100-solar-mass stars.""

His partner Chloe Ross revealed he had been suffering migraines for weeks but had dismissed it as pre-match stress.
Towell was taking part in a welterweight title eliminator against Welsh fighter Dale Evans
Many tributes have been paid to the young fighter from Dundee - known as ""Iron Mike"" - who is only the third professional boxer to die in the UK from apparently fight-related injuries in 21 years.
He passed away with his family at his bedside at Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.
In a Facebook post, his partner Ms Ross said he had suffered brain damage but ""fought right to the end"", surviving for 12 hours after life support was turned off.
""I'm absolutely heartbroken to say my annoying best friend passed away tonight at 11.02 very peacefully,"" she wrote.

The St Andrew's Sporting Club fight took place at Glasgow's Radisson Blu Hotel on Thursday evening.
Towell was knocked down in the first round of the fight before recovering to continue the match.
Referee Victor Loughlin stopped the fight in the fifth round shortly after Towell was knocked down by Carmarthen fighter Evans for a second time.
He received treatment in the ring and was given oxygen before being taken to an ambulance on a stretcher.
A spokesman for St Andrew's Sporting Club later said that Towell's management team was not aware of any headache problems leading up to the fight.
Spencer Oliver, the former European Super Bantamweight champion who was placed in a coma after being injured in a fight in 1998, said Towell would not have been allowed to fight if there had been doubts about his health.
He said: ""He would have to have had all his medical tests. He was in a British title eliminator so all his brain scans would have been up to date and everything would have been in place with Mike going into that contest.""
But boxing promoter Frank Warren raised concerns about the reports that Towell had been suffering from headaches.
He said: ""If that's true, obviously he shouldn't have been fighting.  And I'm quite sure, the doctor, who examines the boxers and the medicals, if they had of known that, they would not have allowed him to box.
""So, obviously once the British Boxing Board of Control complete their investigation into the matter, they'll be able to give further comment on that.""

Towell's family were joined by his manager, Tommy Gilmour, during his final hours.
Mr Gilmour said: ""He was Iron Mike to the end, he kept fighting till the last, and we have lost an exciting boxer but, more importantly, a very special man.
""I am devastated and all my thoughts are with Mike's mum Tracey, his partner Chloe and their little son Rocco.""
Many well known figures in boxing paid tribute to Towell.

Residents say the militants drove into the towns and began shooting, looting and burning houses.
In a separate attack, a young female suicide bomber reportedly killed at least 10 people in the neighbouring state of Yobe.
A witness said the girl, who detonated explosives in the town of Gujba on Tuesday, was about 12 years old.
The Islamist group has not commented on the attack but it is known for carrying out such bombings.
Earlier this year, the Nigerian army seized Gujba from the militant group Boko Haram.
Some 18,000 people have been killed in Nigeria since the group began a campaign of violence in 2009.
One resident who fled Debiro Hawul said that the attack had taken the village by surprise.
""It never occurred to us we would be the next target,"" Umaru Markus told the AFP news agency.
""The gunmen slaughtered 22 people who were not fast enough in fleeing and went about looting homes, grains silos and drug stores,"" he added.
Tuesday's attack in Gujba happened at about 11:00 local time (10:00 GMT).
""It was a suicide attack by a girl of around 12 years,"" said witness Hussaini Aisami.
""She went into the market and headed straight to the grain section. She detonated her explosives in the middle of traders and customers.""
That attack came a day after two female suicide bombers attacked the north-eastern city of Maiduguri, killing at least 20 people.
And in January, at least 19 people were killed by a bomb strapped to a girl aged about 10 in Maiduguri.
Maiduguri is where Boko Haram first emerged, and the Nigerian military has recently begun moving its headquarters from the capital Abuja to the city.

It is the sector's longest period of falling sentiment since 2009 - in the midst of the financial crisis.
The survey of 115 companies found low interest rates and potential restricted EU market access were seen as risks.
But while 28% of the respondents were gloomier, 15% were more optimistic.
And almost 40% of the firms surveyed reported healthy profits in the last quarter.
Rain Newton-Smith, the CBI's chief economist, blamed the dip in sentiment on the ""uncertainty caused by Brexit to low interest rates, technological change and strong competition"".
She called on the chancellor Philip Hammond to ""set a clear direction for growth and prosperity"" in his Autumn Statement in November.
""With firms voicing strong concerns about the impact of Brexit, especially the risks to the wider economy in the years ahead, the government must allay their unease with clear plans for negotiations to leave the EU,"" Ms Newton-Smith added.
The CBI campaigned for Britain to remain in the EU ahead of June's referendum.
Meanwhile, a separate report by the manufacturers' organisation EEF found that the UK's industrial sector had continued to strengthen in 2016, and British firms had created more jobs than equivalent companies in other developed counties, with the exception of the US.

Hartlepool Borough's council asked the area's clinical commissioning group (CCG) to explore with the bidder how it could reach the required standard.
But, the CCG said it could not lawfully treat one bidder differently.
Care Fertility, which operates 15 clinics across Britain and supports fertility services in Hartlepool, said in January it was ""disappointed not to be awarded the contract"".
The council's audit and governance committee asked the CCG to discuss with the firm how it could reduce risks highlighted in its rejected tender.
The CCG said this was not ""reasonably practicable"".
""It is simply not the role of the CCG to guide bidders to make successful tenders,"" it said.
It would be an ""unusual and unwelcome"" precedent for the CCG to advise bidders and would lead to accusations of unfairness if it did not do the same for all other bidders in the future, it said.
It also said re-tendering would take too long, could increase clinical risk and prolong the gap in the delivery of the service and there was ""no guarantee that the outcome would be any different"".

Tim Jones, from the Heart of the South West Local Enterprise Partnership said: ""The French are major investors in our part of the world, EDF Energy, china clay, Brittany Ferries.
""The European partnership is crucial to the South West.  I can't make any judgement here that's going to be beneficial, short or long-term, in a business context.
""The community may have spoken but the business community is still the wealth creating vehicle and we have got to find a way through this.""
Cornwall businesswoman Melanie Evans said she was ""absolutely delighted"" at the result.
""The EU money has been spent unwisely in places on projects that have gone bankrupt and we now have the opportunity to take control of that funding,"" she said.
""We are in a deprived status and we have remained in deprived status even though that funding was coming in so it shows it hasn't worked.""
The people of Cornwall have voted to leave the EU - proof perhaps that money can't buy love.
While Britain as a whole has paid to be part of the EU, Cornwall is in the unusual position of being a net beneficiary.
Despite the huge investment in projects like the Combined Universities in Penryn, the Eden Project and Cornwall Airport Newquay, along with Superfast broadband - many people simply do not think they have felt any benefit.
And some say the fact that Cornwall still qualifies for this extra funding is an indication it hasn't sparked the growth intended.
Remain campaigners have warned Cornwall has always fared badly from Westminster and are not confident of future support of the scale seen from the EU.
But with five out of six Cornish MP's backing Leave during this campaign perhaps this vote here isn't surprising.
Eric Nicholls, Chairman of Cornwall Manufacturers' Group, said: ""Whether Cornwall will continue to receive its EU funding is far from certain, as are the pledges from the Remain side that this would be met from central government.""
Sarah Newton, Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth, who voted Remain, said she wanted to ""make sure the money gets into Cornwall so we can carry on making progress in getting well-paid jobs"".
Cllr Tim Dwelly, leader of the Labour Group at Cornwall Council, said: ""This is a disaster for Cornwall. Years of special EU funding for Cornwall are going to end.

The cable will help the tech giants move data more quickly and cheaply between their global data centres.
Tech companies typically have to pay telecommunications firms to use their cables, which can be costly. And the large amounts of data moving across those lines can make them slower.

Routers are being increasingly targeted by criminals keen to steal data or to help with large-scale web attacks.
Symantec has monitored the network of ""vaccinated"" devices but, so far, has not seen it put to malicious use.
Wifatch was first discovered in late 2014 and since then has been steadily scouring the web for routers and other smart devices running vulnerable software.
In a blogpost, Symantec said that once Wifatch finds and infects a vulnerable router it connects to other compromised devices to download software updates that make them harder to attack successfully.
In addition, it said, Wifatch tries to disinfect devices that have been compromised by malicious software. It regularly reboots devices to kill off malware running on them and return them to a clean state.
As far as Symantec can tell, Wifatch's payload has no malicious components and the growing network of compromised devices has never been used for attacks, said Symantec security analyst Mario Ballano.
The software also leaves a message on the router telling its owner to change the default passwords and update the firmware that controls the device.
Wifatch targets a wide variety of home routers that run variations of the Linux operating system. Symantec said that ""tens of thousands"" of gadgets were harbouring Wifatch. About a third of all the devices it had hit were in China with Brazil and Mexico making up another quarter of its victims.
Symantec remained cautious about the intentions of Wifatch despite its benign appearance.
""Wifatch is a piece of code that infects a device without user consent and, in that regard, is the same as any other piece of malware,"" said Mr Ballano.
""It should also be pointed out that Wifatch contains a number of general-purpose back doors that can be used by the author to carry out potentially malicious actions,"" he added.","A benevolent virus has been used to harden more than 10,000 home routers against cyber-attacks, says a security firm.",34423414,"Symantec has identified a program called Wifatch that is infecting vulnerable home routers and attempting to clean and secure them, but the company remains cautious about the program's intentions and warns that it could be used for malicious purposes.",0,"Article: {}

These men and women show off their favourite finds, and discuss the joys of mudlarking.
Dave Hiddleston, Limehouse
Long fascinated by history and collecting, Dave first discovered mudlarking while he was working on Cannon Street and saw people on the foreshore in wellington boots.
His favourite find is an English community cloth seal, which he believes was used to stamp cloth bags coming through London in about 1618.   It was inside a lump of burnt cinder.
Dave said: ""I am always encouraging others to go mudlarking. It is a great escape from the humdrum of modern life, and interesting doing research on your finds.
""Plus you get to meet some really interesting like-minded people.""
Edward Sandling, Vauxhall
Ted discovered mudlarking by chance. ""I was walking along South Bank,"" he said, ""and I just hopped over a gate and came down to the foreshore. You get a sense of quietude and the perspectives on the city are so different, just by that small change of level.""
He then noticed the objects at his feet, such as this pipe stem shaped like a horse's hoof. He said: ""I have finds that are older and perhaps more beautiful, but this is the one that set it all off.
""It's absolutely beautiful. To hold it and know that someone else was smoking it 150 to 200 years ago is amazing.""
Ted believes that London's beauty lies in the fact that it hasn't all been embanked, and its tides allow these things to be found on the beaches: ""It churns up discoveries every day. Every tide there are new things to be found.""
The one item he is holding out for is a Bartmann jug, decorated stoneware from Germany that was used to transport food, drink and goods. For Ted, ""they inspire thoughts of darkly forested mountains"".
Andrea Smith, Rotherhithe
Although she began only in October last year, Andrea makes time to go to the shore up to six times a week. She uses a metal detector, alongside her eyes and a trowel, to find shards of pottery such as this, painted with a willow pattern.
Andrea said: ""It does not happen often that a shard contains both doves.
""I have found great joy, serenity and peace with my soulmate and best friend, my husband Iain.  This shard represents this to me.""
Sara Cannizzaro, Vauxhall
It's the unexpectedness of mudlarking that drew Sara to it, in contrast to the routine of London life.
""I feel the excitement when I'm walking along the bank,"" she said. ""It's a way of making order out of chaos.""
Sara has managed to find a piece of Bartmann jug, which - from the splashes of cobalt blue glaze - she has dated to 1600-20, made in Frechen.
She said: ""The face that was impressed on the neck of these jugs is a prized find from all mudlarkers - everyone wants to find one!""
Mark Smalley, Rotherhithe
Mark picks the shore in Rotherhithe because of the area's history as the place where pilgrims sailed to America, making him believe it is easier to find trader tokens and hammered coins.
He uses a metal detector, explaining: ""You're looking for the black areas where there's a lot of erosion - that's hopefully where your history will be. The hard pack underneath holds the history.""
His favourite find is a potted ham jar lid, which despite being only Victorian, is very rare as it is intact.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) backed North Wales Police's actions.
An inquest jury concluded the death was accidental through taking cocaine.
The inquest in Abergele, Conwy county, heard Mr Owen, 24, suffered cardiac arrest as a result of taking the drug. He was found to have ""toxic"" levels of cocaine in his body.
He collapsed shortly after being held by members of the public because he was kicking cars as he made his way along Farm Road.
Police were called and Mr Owen was handcuffed but officers noticed almost immediately he had no pulse and attempts to revive him were unsuccessful.
The inquest focused on the attitude of the officers towards him.
Officers had also been called to other incidents in the days before Mr Owen's death including the one where the Taser was used.
The jury was told of concerns that more was not done to respond to his mental state and questions were raised about whether he was treated appropriately given the behaviour he was demonstrating.
The IPCC investigation looked at a number of complaints from Mr Owen's family about the police handling of the incidents.
It found where police used force, including deploying the Taser, it was necessary and appropriate.
It added police had taken steps to assist Mr Owen's welfare and to protect others and tried along with a member of the public to resuscitate him before paramedics arrived.

The fatal stabbing occurred in the living room of Ms Dunlop's Centuripe Avenue home in Ballymena last June.
The court heard that as a result of the attack, the couple's daughter suffered a ""complex and traumatic experience"".
McAuley was told by the judge, Mr Justice Weir, that he had caused ""enormous and permanent harm"" to his daughter.
The court heard that prior to the attack, on the evening of 14  June,  Ms Dunlop and McAuley had gone to her father's house.
As they made their way back home in a taxi accompanied by Ms Dunlop's step-mother, the taxi stopped at an off-licence where alcohol was bought.
When the taxi arrived back at Centuripe Avenue, Ms Dunlop's seven-year old daughter returned home from the babysitter's and they watched football on the TV.
A row between the couple then broke out - possibly over an ice cream that was given to the girl - which resulted in what Mr Justice Weir described as ""mutual pushing and pulling"".

He returned to the living room, where he stabbed his partner three times in the upper body in front of their daughter and Ms Dunlop's step-mother.
A wound to her chest, which passed through her left lung and heart, proved to be the fatal injury.

Saying the row was ""fuelled by drink and drugs"", the judge said a young woman had died in a row which was ""almost unbelievable in its triviality"".
Since murdering Ms Dunlop, the court heard McAuley had made the case that he acted as he did due to provocation.
However, the judge said that while he accepted the couple's 13-year relationship was on and off - largely due to McAuley's substance abuse - there was no history of violence between the couple, and there was ""no justification"" for McAuley's actions.

362,364,"The development could be the starting point for breeding a strain of ash to replace thousands expected to succumb to ash die-back in the next few years.
Ash die-back is now established and spreading within Britain
Researchers are hoping that genetics might yield the knowledge to fight back.
A joint project by the John Innes Centre, the Genome Analysis Centre and the Sainsbury Laboratory  - all based in Norwich - has reached this milestone just two months after receiving the samples.
Dr Mario Caccamo of the Genome Analysis Centre said: ""Speed is important to the research so that all those studying the epidemic can start to look for clues to tackle it.""
And they do mean everyone.
All the data is being put on a crowd sourcing website OpenAshDieBack to enable experts from around the world to help identify genes that might be connected to the trees' ability to withstand the fungus.
These genes could then be part of a breeding programme for resistant trees.
The samples for the latest research came from so-called ""tree 35"", a strain of ash from Denmark originally bred nearly 100 years ago, which has shown an ability to tolerate the fungal disease, when virtually all its Danish relatives were wiped out.
But just planting this variety in the UK would leave us with a narrow genetic base vulnerable to future diseases and not ideally suited to British growing conditions.
Prof  Allan Downie of the John Innes Centre believes this genetic understanding of both the lethal fungal infection and the surviving strain could help fill the impending gap in the canopy.
""We're trying to give nature a bit of a helping hand by identifying the right kind of (native) trees to do the appropriate crosses,"" he said.
""It would be wonderful to be part of the solution but the problem is enormous and the breeding is going to take a long time.""
In March, a related team sequenced the genome of the fungus that causes die-back.
The firm grip of this disease is evident in many of East Anglia's woodlands.
While filming with Countryfile in Suffolk, Paul Beales from Fera, the government's Food and Environment Research Agency, set up a search for the Chalara fraxinea fungus itself.
The symptoms of the disease were plain to see in scars on the trunk and skeletal canopies, but the source of the infection - the sporulating fungus - had not been found in Britain.
After half an hour on hands and knees in the leaf litter and some identification first by magnifying glass and then by genetic analyser, that all changed.
Paul Beales said: ""We've just got the sporing stage of this particular fungus picked up from the ground which has never been found in the UK before.  ""This is a first. It's here to stay.""
If that is true, breeding a tree which can survive alongside it is more crucial than ever.

The 100-page FBI document published on Monday says an unnamed FBI official was ""pressured"" in summer last year to change the classified Clinton email to unclassified.
The official said he had received a call from a colleague - whose name is also redacted - at the FBI's International Operations Division.
The colleague said he had been contacted by Mr Kennedy asking him to change the email's classification level in ""exchange for a 'quid pro quo'"".
The State Department, the FBI document says, offered to ""reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more Agents in countries where they are presently forbidden"".
Mr Kennedy, according to the FBI documents, followed up on this matter at a subsequent meeting, spending 15 minutes attempting to influence the FBI to unclassify the Clinton email.
He also pressed FBI assistant director of counterterrorism Michael Steinbach on the issue.
Republican House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said the revelation ""bears all the signs of a cover-up"".
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump tweeted: ""Unbelievable.""
Mr Kennedy, who has spent more than four decades at the State Department, was already a lightning rod for Republican criticism.
He oversaw both diplomatic security during the 2012 attacks in Benghazi and the records and IT departments during Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server.
But State Department Deputy spokesman Mark Toner denied any wrongdoing by Mr Kennedy.
""Under Secretary Kennedy sought to understand the FBI's process for withholding certain information from public release,"" Mr Toner said.
""As has been reported, there have been discussions within the interagency on issues of classification.""
The email in question was among some 100 messages recovered from Mrs Clinton's private email server that the FBI would ultimately designate as classified.
The FBI and State Department engaged in a review of the former secretary of state's emails as they were being made ready for public release.
FBI Director James Comey concluded in his investigation Mrs Clinton had been ""extremely careless"" in handling the classified material.
The scandal has fuelled the perception among many voters she is untrustworthy.

365,367,"It was a scrappy effort, which saved the game from going to what had seemed an inevitable penalty shootout.
Stevie Mallan though had earlier missed the game's best chance for the home side when he failed to score from the penalty spot.
St Mirren now lead Group G by three points.
It might have been picture postcard weather for the first half in Paisley, but there wasn't much to write home about.
St Mirren were too predictable with long balls floated forward for John Sutton and David Clarkson up front, although Mallan's dead ball delivery was, as always, a threat.
Ayr started well enough and Paul Cairney had a real early chance, but after that Saints looked comfortable at the back.
St Mirren's best chance of the half fell for Calum Gallacher who got on to the end of a lovely ball from Clarkson.
It was screaming for the first-time volley, but he chose the wrong option in taking a touch and the opportunity melted in the evening sun.
Things, we hoped, could only get better in the second half.
They did. A bit.
Lewis Morgan was highly impressive down the left side for the home team, embracing the concept of dazzling wing play and hitting the by-line before delivering the cross. But no-one could cash in.
He won his team a penalty with another dazzling run. The usually deadly Mallan took the spot kick, but United goalkeeper Greg Fleming produced a wonderful save to his right hand side to urge the game toward further penalties after 90 minutes.
But then central defender Baird chipped in with his last-minute effort, bundling the ball over the line after a scramble in the box.
Enough to set Saints proudly at the top of their section.
St Mirren manager Alex Rae: ""We struggled to get any intensity in the first half. I'm conscious of the fact it was really warm out there tonight.
""A lot of the boys are just not up to speed. This competition has come really early.
""Lewis Morgan tonight was sensational, driving at people. The boy is making a really big impact.
""I spoke to Stewart (Gilmour, the chairman) before the game, there may be funds for a loan deal, but we'll try and squeeze a few quid out of him.""
Ayr United manager Ian McCall: ""I thought it was a really poor game of football. We're a mile short in terms of bodies and fitness but a draw would have been fair. To lose one so late is hard to take.
""But, we've got two games left and if we win them two you never know.
""We need strikers. We need a wide player. We need a centre back. We're four or five short of where we want to be. The substitutes Alex (Rae) was able to make was the difference.""

The firm said the charity had blocked any contact for almost a year and it was considering seeking a court order.
The National Trust said it opposed any activities leading to the extraction of fossil fuels, so rejected requests.
Moves to look for shale gas in the Sherwood Forest area have proved controversial due to environmental concerns over extraction - known as fracking - and expansion of fossil fuel use.
Ineos said it already had permission from nearby landowners for the the non-invasive survey and its ability to extract gas would be ""significantly limited"" if it could not get on to Clumber Park.

369,371,"The Sentencing Council also suggests judges could give longer sentences to offenders who film their victims.
In a new consultation, the body says judges should closely consider the complex and damaging effect that a crime has on a victim.
The proposed new guidelines cover virtually all sexual offences.
The Sentencing Council is responsible for trying to ensure consistency in criminal sentencing across all courts in England and Wales and it draws up complex guidelines to assist judges.
The council said that its proposed guidelines for sexual offences aim to update the way the courts deal with 54 crimes, to take into account the tactics and technologies used by offenders, as well as the long-term damage done to a victim.
The guidelines cover almost every sexual offence that is recognised in the UK, from voyeurism to rape, and, if adopted, would play a key role in dealing with people convicted of historic allegations of sexual abuse when victims have come forward decades after the event.
In the 14-week consultation, the council said that judges should be able to send offenders to jail for longer where modern technology proves to be an aggravating factor in increasing the victim's suffering - such as filming abuse of a sexual assault and then distributing it to others.
Judges are concerned that they have seen a worrying increase in the number of cases where rapists have filmed their attack and the victim.
Previously the focus in sentencing has been largely on the physical act of the crime, such as which part of a body was violated, because the law defines each individual offence in a quite technical way.
The council's new guidelines make clear that this form of sentencing does not take sufficient account the potentially catastrophic long-term effect on the victim.
Under the new guidelines, judges would also be able to jail those guilty of so-called ""one-off"" rapes for a maximum of 19 years, a sentence that is currently only for offenders who attack more than once.
Judges can also take into account the behaviour of an offender before the specific offence, such as whether they use drugs and alcohol as part of their targeting.
Sentencing for sexual offences against children should also look at how the victim has been groomed or whether the assailant was in a position of trust.
Lord Justice Treacy of the council said: ""We're improving guidance for courts to help them deal with these incredibly complex, sensitive and serious offences.
""The perspective of victims is central to the council's considerations. We want to ensure sentences reflect everything the victim has been through and what the offender has done.
""We are looking at the whole context, not just the physical offence but also the tactics employed by offenders like grooming activity, the targeting of vulnerable victims or abuse of a position of trust.
""No one wants more people becoming victims, so protecting the public is a vital part of our proposals, whether this is by jailing offenders or through rigorous treatment to stop them reoffending.""
Psychological impact is already taken into consideration in assault and burglary guidelines, but Lord Justice Treacy told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that ""current [sexual offence] guidelines don't concentrate enough on the perspective of victims"".
Sexual violence campaigner Jill Saward, who was raped by two burglars who broke into her home in Ealing, London, in 1986, welcomed the proposals.
""For too long, the impact that [sexual violence] has had on victims has  been neglected in the whole justice process,"" she said.
In the aftermath of her attack, she saw a psychotherapist, a psycho-analyst and psychiatrist, but that was not mentioned in court, she said.
At the sentencing of her attackers, Mr Justice Leonard said that her trauma ""had not been so great"" - a comment he was censured for and apologised for later in his life.
""That reflected how little understanding there was. I'd been suicidal three times, I'd had post-traumatic stress disorder, which wasn't really recognised then,"" she said.
She added that victims often felt a sense of responsibility to other potential victims, and were relieved when their rapist was locked up for a long time, thereby preventing further attacks.",Sentences for rapists and other sex offenders in England and Wales could become tougher to recognise the long-term psychological harm they cause.,20619590,"The Sentencing Council in the UK is proposing new guidelines for sentencing sexual offenders that take into account the long-term psychological impact of the crime on victims, including the use of modern technology to increase suffering, and consider the victim's perspective as central to the sentencing process.",0,"Article: {}

Media playback is not supported on this device
As well as defender Terry and midfielder Matic, Chelsea have sold Asmir Begovic to Bournemouth, while last season's top scorer Diego Costa has been told he is free to leave.
The recruitment of midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko from Monaco, striker Alvaro Morata from Real Madrid, defender Antonio Rudiger from Roma and former Manchester City keeper Willy Caballero fills the gaps vacated by this quartet.
But Conte has made no secret of his desire to recruit more players to strengthen his first team for a season that sees the addition of Champions League matches to their fixture list.
Having also sold Nathan Ake to Bournemouth and loaned fellow defender Kurt Zouma to Stoke, the suspension of Cahill will further deplete Conte's resources.
Equally, Fabregas' ban deprives him of another midfielder, with Bakayoko, Hazard and Pedro all out injured.
Conte felt Cahill's dismissal was pivotal to the outcome of Saturday's game against Burnley, with Chelsea 3-0 down at the break following two goals from Sam Vokes and a Stephen Ward strike.
A debut goal from substitute Morata and a late David Luiz finish gave them hope, but Burnley held on for the win.

In CCTV footage shown to the High Court in Edinburgh, Mr Logie could be seen lying motionless on the ground after the assault.
Advocate depute Andrew Brown QC told the court: ""Witnesses speak to hearing the sound of a crack as the deceased's head hit the ground and he did not move thereafter.""
The construction manager suffered a brain injury and fracture to the back of his head following the attack at Friars Street on 7 August.
Spendiff, of Cullercoats, North Tyneside, admitted assaulting and killing Mr Logie by punching him on the head causing him to fall to the ground where he struck his head.
He also pled guilty to committing a breach of the peace along with Shaun McCarthy by conducting themselves in a disorderly manner and fighting with others.
Both also pled guilty to assaulting Paul Stubberfield and Stuart McKee in a taxi in Friars Street.
The court heard that Spendiff and McCarthy had gone out drinking for the evening after working together as technicians on wind turbines.
Mr Brown said that everyone appeared to be in good spirits, but a member of the stag party and another drinker then became involved in a heated argument.
After patrons left the pub, a general melee broke out which ended with the fatal blow to Mr Logie.
Mr Brown said: ""Spendiff punched the deceased, who again had his arms up and out to the side, once on the face with force causing him to collapse to the ground.
""He swung another punch at the deceased as he fell but missed.
""With the deceased now on the ground Spendiff initially moved away before returning and danced round the deceased, at all times being moved away by the accused McCarthy and at one stage a female passer-by.""
Mark Stewart QC, for Spendiff, said the killer had expressed his sorrow for the victim and his family.

379,381,"Five justices in the Supreme Court dismissed the challenge for an inquiry into the shootings at Batang Kali in 1948 by a four to one majority.
The families, who say the men were ""massacred"", had their case rejected by the UK Court of Appeal last year.
British forces at the time of the killings said the men were insurgents.
In the Supreme Court panel's judgement, one of the justices, Lord Kerr, described the case as ""shocking"" and said the ""overwhelming preponderance of currently available evidence"" showed ""wholly innocent men were mercilessly murdered"".
He said it was ""with regret"" that he dismissed the appeal.
""This is an instance where the law has proved itself unable to respond positively to the demand that there be redress for the historical wrong that the appellants so passionately believe has been perpetrated on them and their relatives,"" Lord Kerr said.
""That may reflect a deficiency in our system of law. It certainly does not represent any discredit on the honourable crusade that the appellants have pursued.""
Another of the justices, Lady Hale, said she would have allowed the appeal and said the UK government ""did not seriously consider the most cost-effective form which such an inquiry might take"".
""They did not seriously consider the ""bigger picture"": the public interest in properly inquiring into an event of this magnitude; the private interests of the relatives and survivors in knowing the truth and seeing the reputations of their deceased relatives vindicated,"" she said.
The appellants in the case - Chong Nyok Keyu, Loh Ah Choi, Lim Kok and Wooi Kum Thai, two of whom were at Batang Kali as children - were supported by the action group Condemning The Batang Kali Massacre, a campaign in Malaysia that includes 568 civil society organisations.
Michael Fordham QC, representing the appellants, told the court that the families wished to ""vindicate the legitimate interests of the deceased, in order to achieve justice, before they die themselves"".
Relatives argued that Article 2 - the right to life - of the European Convention on Human Rights imposes a duty on the UK to commission an independent inquiry, despite the killings occurring before the convention was drafted and signed.
It was argued on behalf of the government that the Human Rights Act ""does not have retrospective effect and does not impose an obligation to hold an inquiry into deaths occurring several decades before it came into force"".
The account of the British authorities at the time was that the deceased were justifiably shot while they were attempting to escape from the patrol.
An official explanation was contained in a written parliamentary answer in Hansard, published on 26 January 1949.
On 11 and 12 December 1948 - when Malaya was still a British colony - 24 villagers were killed by a platoon of Scots Guards during a raid at Batang Kali.
The men were Chinese migrant workers suspected by the British of helping rebels during the Malayan Emergency - a conflict between communist guerrillas and British and Commonwealth forces, which lasted 12 years.
An investigation at the time cleared the soldiers of wrongdoing, but in 1970 some of the soldiers said the villagers had been executed.
In the 1990s, authorities in Malaysia opened an investigation, but it was halted before a conclusion was reached.

It also lets the handhelds act as controllers for the firm's Internet Explorer web browser, which will launch on the console later this year.
The move poses a challenge to Nintendo's Wii U Game Pad.
While the Japanese company's product is specifically designed to enhance the experience of using its next-generation console, Microsoft is offering users a way to extend the functionality of its existing games machines via third-party devices they may already have.
""Xbox SmartGlass works with all the devices that you already own: the TV you already own, the phone you already own and the tablet you already own,"" said Marc Whitten, head of Microsoft's Xbox Live division.
""Xbox SmartGlass turns any TV into a smart TV.""
A demo showed the highly anticipated first-person shooter Halo 4 using the facility to trigger maps and other data about its in-game environment.
The announcement
 was made in Microsoft's keynote presentation at the E3 video games trade show in Los Angeles.
Mr Whitten added that SmartGlass would also enhance television programmes and films streamed through the Xbox.
He gave the example of a viewer watching Game of Thrones on their television and being able to look down at their tablets to see where on-screen characters were located on a map of the show's fantasy world.
The demonstration also showed how the linked device could bring up details about the cast and characters while the user was watching a film.
""It lets Microsoft say that you don't need to buy new hardware to have a two-screen experience,"" Stephen Totilo, editor of gaming website Kotaku, told the BBC.
""Nintendo looked to be ahead of everyone else on this, but now Microsoft is breathing down its neck. But there may be a little bit of smoke and mirrors here as I'm not convinced SmartGlass will have as much functionality as the Wii U offers.""
The app was also mocked by South Park's creator Trey Parker who was at the event to promote a new video game featuring his characters.
""How many times have you been watching an episode of South Park and thought I'd like to be able to watch this on my television while hooked into my mobile device which is being controlled by my tablet device which is hooked into my oven all while sitting in the refrigerator,"" he joked.
New uses for Microsoft's Kinect motion and voice sensor also featured heavily in the E3 presentation.
A tie-up with Nike

Voice commands were shown being used to change team formations in the next edition of the American Football simulation John Madden NFL, and to call in air strikes in the action game Splinter Cell Blacklist.
A new game called Wrecketer also allows players to use gestures to launch and guide missiles to destroy castles in a title based around a similar concept to Angry Birds.
Microsoft also promoted its device as an entertainment hub.
A new service called Xbox Music will offer ""over 30 million music tracks"" to the Xbox as well as Windows 8 and Windows Phone devices.
A video suggested the service would rival similar offerings from Spotify, Rdio and others. However, details were scant with no launch date or countries mentioned, and no comment about how it would affect the firm's existing Zune product.
US users were promised new content including NBA basketball games, Paramount Pictures movies and Nickelodeon children's programmes.
Much of the rest of the presentation was dedicated to trailers showcasing new titles in existing video game franchises such as Tomb Raider, Fable, Call of Duty and Resident Evil.
""We're probably getting a new Xbox console in 2013 so that will be what the next E3 is about, so they had to spend this year talking about the stuff that precedes it,"" said Mr Totilo.

387,389,"They want England, Wales and Northern Ireland brought in line with Scotland.
The bill proposes amending the 1988 Road Traffic Act to lower the blood-alcohol concentration limit from 80mg alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg.
The government said the current limit struck a balance between safety and personal freedom.
The bill, which will be debated in the Lords on Friday, also proposes lowering the limits for alcohol in breath and urine when driving a vehicle.
Because everyone has a different susceptibility to alcohol, health experts say it is difficult to quantify exactly how many units can be drunk before reaching the proposed new limit.
For the average man, it would be just under a pint of beer or a large glass of wine and for women, half a pint of beer or a small glass of wine.
In a letter to the Times, the Alcohol Health Alliance said the move would save lives and improve road safety.
The alliance, which is made up of organisations including the Royal College of Physicians, the British Medical Association and Alcohol Concern, said that at the current limit, drivers are six times more likely to die in a road traffic accident than those who have not drunk any alcohol.
It said a vote in favour of the bill would signal to the government that ""now is the time time to lower the drink-driving limit"".
Scotland lowered its drink-driving limit to the proposed new level in December 2014 and police figures show that drink-drive offences there fell by 17% in the first three months of 2015.
Northern Ireland is currently consulting on whether to lower its limit.
At present, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have one of the highest drink-driving limits in Europe.
The World Health Organization recommends a limit of 50mg/100ml.
Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, chair of the Alcohol Health Alliance and honorary professor in clinical science at the University of Liverpool, said the overriding reason for lowering the limit was that ""several hundreds of lives could be saved in England each year"".
And he said the scientific evidence for the change was strong.
""There is a wealth of published, peer-reviewed, high quality research on the impact of alcohol on psychomotor skills and judgement.
""While even low levels have an effect on these critical functions, the deterioration in performance moving from a blood level of 50 to 80mg per 100ml are striking.""
Prof Gilmore said there was public support for a lowering of the legal drink-drive limit at a time when drink-driving appears to be on the rise.
The Local Government Association recently estimated that lowering the current limit would also save nearly Â£300m a year by reducing police and ambulance call-outs and hospital admissions.
A spokesman for the Department for Transport said: ""The drink-driving limit for England and Wales strikes an important balance between safety and personal freedom.
""By having our limit, we are not criminalising those who drink a small amount a long time before driving, but our advice remains unchanged: don't take the risk by driving after you have had a drink.""

Freeing children to go out alone in their local area benefited their health and development, the researchers said.
Fear over traffic was the top reason for restricting freedom, they added.
The children and their parents were surveyed between 2010 and 2012 about what they were allowed to do in their local neighbourhoods without supervision.
This included:
The study said: ""A large proportion of children under 11 years old in most of the countries do not have the the freedom to get about their local area.
""Even the oldest children are restricted in what they are allowed to do, at an age when many of the rights of adulthood are close to being granted, including the right to drive vehicles on the road once the test has been passed.""

Election officials have urged patience.
Uhuru Kenyatta, who faces trial at the International Criminal Court, has been leading in early presidential results declared from Monday's tightly contested election.
He is due to stand trial at The Hague next month for allegedly fuelling violence after the disputed 2007 election. He denies the charge.
His closest rival is outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga.
With provisional results in from more than 40% of polling stations earlier on Wednesday, Mr Odinga had 42% of the vote compared with Mr Kenyatta's 53%.
However, Mr Odinga's allies remain confident that he will gain ground as results from his strongholds, including the Coast Province, are declared.
More than 1,000 people were killed in the violence which broke out in 2007-08 after Mr Odinga claimed he had been cheated of victory by supporters of President Mwai Kibaki, who is stepping down after two terms in office.
The BBC's Solomon Mugera in the capital, Nairobi, says Kenyans are becoming increasingly anxious about the delay in finalising the results.
Some businesses and schools across the country have remained shut since Monday's election, he says.
This has led to a shortage of goods, pushing up the prices of basic foodstuff in areas such as Kibera, the biggest slum in Nairobi and a stronghold of Mr Odinga, our correspondent adds.

Some electoral officials have had to drive hundreds of kilometres to the counting centre in Nairobi to deliver paper copies of the tally of their returns.
At about 13:00 local time, returning officers from only 53 of the 290 constituencies had arrived and the election commission said it would announce results from constituencies as they were ready.
Its website had stopped giving updated results from the presidential race on Wednesday, and was still showing figures from Tuesday night.
Our correspondent says the large number of spoiled ballots - about 6% of the total vote, well over double the number of votes cast for the third-placed candidate, Musailia Mudavadi - has become a major bone of contention.
Mr Odinga's Coalition of Reforms and Democracy (Cord) wants them to be counted, but Mr Kenyatta's Jubilee Coalition is resisting this.
Late on Tuesday, the election commission announced that the spoiled ballots would count in the overall vote total, increasing the likelihood of a run-off between the top two candidates, news agencies report.
Mr Kenyatta's running mate William Ruto, who is also facing a trial at the ICC, said foreign embassies may have influenced such a decision.
""We want to believe that this is not an attempt to deny the Jubilee Coalition a first-round victory as is clearly now on the wall,"" he is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying.
But the election commission now says a decision on what to do about the spoiled ballots will be taken after all other votes are counted, our correspondent reports.
If no agreement is reached, one of the presidential candidates is bound to mount a legal challenge, he says.
As there are different types of spoiled ballots, a possible compromise would be to include those that were annulled simply because they had been put in the wrong box - for instance, in the parliamentary box rather the presidential box - while excluding a ballot paper on which a person had voted for two candidates, our reporter says.
In the run-up to the election, the European Union (EU) said it would only have limited contact with a president who faced trial at the ICC, while US Assistant Secretary of State Johnnie Carson warned Kenyan voters that ""choices have consequences"".
The winning candidate must get more than 50% of the total votes cast and at least 25% of votes in half of the 47 counties.
If there is no clear winner, a second round of voting will take place, probably on 11 April.

392,394,"He called on Prime Minister Theresa May to accept all refugee children with a legal right to be in the UK, ahead of French plans to shut the ""Jungle"" camp.
Mr Jones said Wales was ready to support the UK government in welcoming greater numbers of vulnerable children.
The Home Office said its priority was to ensure the safety of children in the Calais camp.
Mr Jones made the case in a joint statement with Kirsty Davies-Warner, head of Oxfam Cymru; Mary Powell-Chandler, head of Save the Children in Wales; Huw Thomas, head of Christian Aid Wales, and Jim Barnaville, co-chair of Citizens Cymru Wales.
The statement said Mr Jones had written to the prime minister expressing ""our shared view that the UK government should take urgent action to resettle more unaccompanied refugee children in the UK and offering the support of Wales in welcoming them"".
With the French government set to demolish the Calais ""Jungle"" camp, the statement asked Mrs May to ""allow all those refugee children with a legal right to be in the UK into the country with the utmost urgency"".
""The children in the camp, some of whom have been as young as eight years old, have fled conflict and persecution and are now stuck in northern France, deeply traumatised and at considerable risk,"" the statement read.
""Every extra day we take places these children at greater risk.""
The Immigration Act included an amendment, originally put forward by Lord Dubs, that places a legal requirement on government to arrange for the transfer to the UK of unaccompanied refugee children from Europe.
The statement welcomed a commitment from the UK government to resettle children who have a legal right to be in the UK, but called on Ms May to do more, adding: ""Wales is ready to support the UK government in welcoming more vulnerable children as refugees via the Dubs amendment"".
The children's charity Unicef has appealed to the UK government to speed up the transfer of unaccompanied child refugees in Calais.
It has said it is concerned the planned closure of the camp will lead to children there disappearing before they are processed.
A Home Office spokesman said: ""Our priority must be to ensure the safety and security of the children in the Calais camp.""
He said that Home Secretary Amber Rudd had told the French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve that the UK government intended to transfer as many minors as possible eligible under the Dublin Regulation before the start of the clearance.
Under the Dublin Regulation, asylum seekers must make an initial asylum claim in the first EU state they reach, but can apply for asylum in other EU states if they have family there.
""In addition, children who are eligible to come to the UK under the Dubs Amendment to the Immigration Act 2016 must be looked after in safe facilities where their best interests are properly considered,"" the spokesman added.

398,400,"Motorcycles used as taxis and known as boda bodas are time-savers for people who need to get somewhere in Tanzania's north-western city of Mwanza.
They seem to be the only way to beat traffic jams. But when you get on the bike and wrap your arms around the driver, you are actually putting your life in his hands.
In the first half of this year, there were more than 5,000 road accidents in Tanzania. More than a quarter of them were motorcycle accidents.
Boda boda drivers are often blamed for causing the problems on Mwanza's roads. They might get you where you want to go quickly, but they have a reputation for driving recklessly.
There are hundreds of them competing for fares, which increases the risk of accidents.
But that is also where trainee doctor Marko Hingi saw an opportunity to turn boda boda drivers into true life-savers.
He was inspired by the fact that wherever there is a medical emergency in Mwanza, there is likely to be a motorcycle taxi driver nearby.
""We have human beings here and we can use them as volunteers to help,"" says Mr Hingi, who works at a hospital in the city.
He is also head of the Tanzania Rural Health Movement, which recruits boda boda drivers and turns them into first-responders, acting like paramedics.
""In the past when somebody got injured, he bled while people looked at him until he died,"" says Anicet Mase, one of Mr Hingi's volunteer drivers.
Now Mr Mase zips around Mwanza wearing a fluorescent orange vest and a backpack full of bandages and other first-aid kit.
He and the other volunteer drivers have been trained in basic first-aid, such as keeping airways open, stopping bleeding and splinting fractured bones.
The drivers also have mobile phones and are linked to a system called Beacon.
Mwanza's fire station receives calls reporting emergencies.
A dispatcher enters the details into the Beacon software, which then sends a text message to everyone linked to the system.
If a motorcycle taxi driver is nearby, he can respond to the emergency.
""We've designed [the Beacon] to be used in countries that don't have the resources to implement a robust EMS [Emergency Medical Services] system,"" says Michael McGee, the East Africa representative of Trek Medics International, which developed Beacon and runs a similar programme in the Dominican Republic.
This ""robust"" service involves people calling for ambulances on emergency numbers such as 999, 112 or 911.
But this is expensive and does not exist in many poorer countries. It is up to the sick and injured to get to hospital any way they can.
When Mr Hingi was six he remembers his sick mother walking to hospital, worrying that wild dogs would attack her on the way.
That childhood memory inspired Mr Hingi's dream to become a doctor and bring ambulances to Mwanza.
""Communities are suffering because they lack a good system to help them,"" he says.
As for Mr Mase, he is driven by the idea that boda boda drivers are now given the opportunity to counter their bad reputation for putting lives at risk on the roads.
A big part of his work is to deal with injuries caused on the roads.
About 90% of the 1.25 million people killed every year in traffic accidents die in low and middle income countries.
However, there is a limit to what motorbike drivers can do to help.
Some of Tanzania's roads are in too bad a condition for them to reach patients and evacuate them safely.
So, even though the motorcycles in Mwanza find it easier to avoid potholes and wind through traffic, there is work to be done before boda boda drivers can really claim to be saving lives rather than putting them at risk.","Tanzania's motorcycle taxi drivers, often associated with deadly road accidents, are being trained to become life-savers, writes Ross Velton.",38018716,"In Mwanza, Tanzania, boda boda motorcycle taxis are being used as volunteer first-responders to quickly reach medical emergencies and provide basic first-aid, thanks to a training program led by a local doctor and a text-messaging system called Beacon, but the drivers' safety and the poor road conditions pose limitations to their life-saving abilities.",0,"Article: {}

Earlier, Bianchi's father Philippe had described the situation as ""desperate"".

""He will not give up, I'm sure of that. I can see it. I believe it.""
He added in an interview with Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport: ""I speak to him. I know he can hear me.
""His doctors have told us that this is already a miracle, no-one has ever survived such a serious accident. But Jules won't give up.
""His trainer Andrea says that if there is one person who can make it happen with his will, it's Jules.""
Philippe said the family had been touched by the show of support from other Formula 1 drivers, who gathered at the front of the grid before the Russian Grand Prix, arms around each other's shoulders, forming a 'circle of solidarity' for Jules.
""I've never seen anything like that,"" Philippe said. ""It touched us very deeply. We thank every one of them. So many of them have been in touch, written to me; [Fernando] Alonso, [Jean-Eric] Vergne, [Felipe] Massa have given strong messages.
""[Lewis] Hamilton wrote me a beautiful email in which he says that if there is anything he can do, he's there. [Valentino] Rossi and [Marc] Marquez from Moto GP too.""
Philippe also said he is using the accident of seven-time world champion Michael Schumacher, who continues his recovery at home after suffering a head injury in a skiing accident in December, as a reference point.
""I was very sad when he got hurt,"" Philippe said. ""I kept wondering, like every one else 'Why don't they tell us more about how he is?'.
""But now I'm in the same position I understand. Everyone keeps asking me how Jules is but I can't reply, there is no answer. It's very serious but he's stable.

402,404,"Researchers funded by the charity found that by looking at a specific group of genes they were able to reliably detect underlying problems.
It follows the death of Sir David Frost's son Miles, who died suddenly from a condition thought to have been inherited from his father.
His family aims to raise Â£1.5m to make genetic testing available in the UK.
The eldest son of the late presenter and broadcaster died last year, aged 31, when he was out jogging near his family's home in Oxfordshire.
He was suffering from an undiagnosed heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Previous genetic tests looked at a small number of genes and were only able to identify specific conditions, leading to higher costs and longer diagnosis time - a major barrier to rolling the test out across the NHS.
But researchers from Imperial College London and the MRC Clinical Sciences Centre say the new test, which looks at 174 genes, is quicker and more reliable.
It has already been rolled out at the Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust in London , with around 40 patients per month being successfully tested.
Dr James Ware, a consultant cardiologist specialising in inherited heart conditions, said: ""Without a genetic test we often have to keep the whole family under regular surveillance for many years. This is hugely costly for both the families and the health system.
""By contrast, when a genetic test reveals the precise genetic abnormality causing the condition in one member of the family, it becomes simple to test other family members. Those who do not carry the faulty gene copy can be reassured and spared countless hospital visits.""
The research has been funded by the British Heart Foundation and the findings published in the Journal of Cardiovascular Translational Research.","A new blood test could help diagnose people with inherited heart conditions, the British Heart Foundation has said.",35607317,"Researchers have developed a new genetic test that can reliably detect underlying heart conditions by looking at a specific group of genes, which could potentially save the NHS millions of pounds and provide quicker diagnoses for families with inherited heart conditions.",1,"Article: {}

408,410,"Authorities believe 19 Gourma elephants have been killed for their tusks in the past month. There are estimated to be just 350-500 of the group left.
Poaching has been linked in the past to rebel groups in the region, who have connections to smuggling rings.
The Gourma elephants migrate around 600km (370 miles) a year to feed.
Because of the sparse vegetation in northern Mali they have a long-distance migration pattern that runs into Burkina Faso and Niger.
On Tuesday, Colonel Soumana Timbo of the government's nature conservation division asked MPs to provide military support to protect the species.
Mr Timbo told the BBC that the small number of rangers assigned to the region were already risking their lives.
""In the Gourma zone there is total insecurity. We have about 10 rangers covering about 1.25 million hectares, so it's quite insufficient,"" Mr Timbo said.
""If we send out two rangers on a motorbike they are risking their lives. So we really need joint patrols - military and rangers - and we need to focus all our efforts on stopping this massacre.""
Northern Mali has been a flashpoint of conflict since Mali's independence from French rule in 1960, with the Tuareg rebels campaigning for independence or more autonomy.
The region has been further destabilised by the emergence of jihadi groups including al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), which has targeted both the government and the rebels.
In its own attempt to combat poaching, South Africa has appointed a panel of experts to examine the viability of a legal rhino horn trade,
Levels of poaching have risen to record levels in South Africa. The country is thought to be home to around 20,000 rhinos, around 80% of the worldwide population.
There were 1,215 rhinos killed in South Africa in 2014, a 21% increase on the previous year, officials say.
The 21-member panel will examine whether a legal trade in rhino horn may reduce the number of animals targeted by poachers.
""It is important to emphasise that South Africa has not taken a position on the issue and will not do so until the committee has completed its work and presented its findings,"" the environment ministry said in a statement.","A rare population of elephants in northern Mali is being targeted by poachers, threatening its survival, a wildlife official has said.",31373711,"Authorities believe 19 Gourma elephants have been killed for their tusks in the past month, leaving only 350-500 individuals remaining, and are seeking military support to protect the species, while South Africa is considering legally trading rhino horn to reduce poaching, which has reached record levels with 1,215 rhinos killed in 2014.",0,"Article: {}

409,411,"A report to a UN ocean conference in New York points out that more than 60% of the ocean has no rules because it’s outside national jurisdiction.
It says the open ocean is at risk from climate change, over-fishing, deep sea mining, farm pollution and plastics.
The authors say one area – the Bay of Bengal - is at a tipping point which could impact on global fish stocks.
The report was commissioned to inform delegates preparing a UN resolution on governance of the open ocean.
Representatives in New York are preparing a text that could cover everything from establishing marine protected areas to distributing the benefits of valuable biotech products generated from the seas.
One of the report’s authors, Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University, told BBC News: “This is very, very important. A lot of states are looking towards developing industrial activities in the ocean – fishing, deep-sea mining, renewable energy… even aquaculture offshore.
“It’s really vital that we come to some international agreement on how to protect or manage biodiversity on high seas in the face of all these pressures.”
The UN is focusing discussion on three areas:
Together they are categorised under a new UN acronym – BBNJ. That’s Biodiversity Beyond National Jurisdiction.
Prof Rogers’ report is a review of new science over the past five years. He says he realises how little is known about some essential ocean processes, and mentions the Bay of Bengal issue as a source of great concern.
The issue there is nitrogen, which performs an positive role in fertilising algae at the bottom of the food chain, but can also have negative effects if there’s too much of it in the water.
At the moment, nitrogen fertilisers in the Bay of Bengal are running off farmland and over-fertilising algae. This in turn encourages bacteria, which capture oxygen. Slowly marine life in the area disappears.
But the Bay of Bengal is now on the verge of going one destructive stage more.
The report says if oxygen levels decrease further as a result of run-off or increasing water temperatures, then the entire ocean basin may flip to a no-oxygen status.
In one of Nature’s paradoxes, this would then lead to different bacteria actually removing nitrogen from the water.
Prof Rogers said the de-nitrified water would then be carried away by ocean currents, and greatly reduce ocean productivity elsewhere.
Dr Greg Cowie from Edinburgh University told BBC News that the growing dead zone in the Bay of Bengal would have enormous local consequences.
“You have to remember there are 400 million people living round the rim of the bay. There are half a million fishers. If the situation gets much worse we are going to get a huge human problem,” he said.
Christiana Figueres, a former chief climate negotiator, is joining a push at the UN for a formal treaty process to safeguard the high seas.
She says a healthy ocean can buffer the planet against changing climate by continuing to soak up CO2 emissions from the air.
She told BBC News: “As with the atmosphere, the high seas belong to everyone. But they have also been damaged by all.  What could be seen by some as the tragedy of the commons can also be recognized now as an opportunity for a radical recovery of the commons.”
The deep sea is the biggest store of CO2 emissions from humanity, as ocean circulation pulls in carbon from the atmosphere and tiny marine plants called phytoplankton soak it up.
These are then eaten by creatures called zooplankton and their bodies sink to the ocean floor.
The Oxford scientists say as the seas warm, the abundance of phytoplankton may fall. This will impact the whole food web, including fish stocks and the rate at which CO2 is locked up on the sea bed.
They also say raised sea temperatures have resulted in the rise of Vibriobacteria, which live in warm seas and have been associated with a global increase in illnesses like cholera, gastroenteritis, wound infections and septicaemia.
They echo the many recent warnings about increasing quantities of plastics large and small, although they say the effects are as yet poorly understood.
Their report says the effects of ocean mining must be carefully monitored, too.
Meanwhile, a third UK pub group has announced it will stop using plastic straws is a small contribution to reducing ocean plastic waste. The Liberation Group, based in the West Country and the Channel Islands, is supporting Jersey’s Straws Suck campaign.
It follows a BBC News story highlighting a plea for plastic straws to be taxed because  so many of them get blown into water courses.

""I'm not stupid enough to say I'm ready. I still think I have got a lot to learn. The last two-and-a-half years have been great for me.
""But I have not had any contact from Rangers. I don't know where these stories have come from.""
Despite his lack of senior managerial experience, Ferguson admitted he would ""run back"" to a club he helped to 15 domestic trophies as a player, including five league titles.
""It was a club I was at from eight years old,"" he noted. ""I left for a couple of years to go down to Blackburn but I came back.  It was a dream of mine to play for Rangers and then to captain them and win things.

While under-20s coach Graeme Murty remains in caretaker charge following Warburton's departure on 10 February, Ferguson believes other favourites for the role would not want the job on a temporary basis.

415,417,"Wales international Rhys Priestland's early penalty, followed by conversions of tries for both Leroy Houston and Ollie Devoto gave Bath a 17-0 lead.
Despite Irish scrum-half Brendan McKibbin's red card, Scott Steele's try whittled it back to 17-7 by the break.
But Bath ran in four second half-tries from Alafoti Faosiliva, Kyle Eastmond, Priestland and Nikola Matawalu.
Irish were always up against it from the 20th minute onwards after Australian scrum-half McKibbin was sent off for stamping on prop Henry Thomas's head.
And their only second-half response was a try from Fergus Mulchrone 11 minutes after the break, also converted by Shane Geraghty.
Former Exiles full-back Tom Homer, playing against his old club for the first time, then England fly-half George Ford took over Bath's second-half kicking duties.
Homer converted the first two before Ford came off the bench to also get on the scoresheet by improving the last two.
The fourth of Bath's six tries earned the visitors a bonus point as they recorded their eighth win in nine visits to the Madejski Stadium to hand the Exiles a fourth straight Premiership defeat.
Along with Newcastle, who were beaten at Worcester, Irish are one of two teams at the foot of the table still seeking their first point.
Bath confirmed on Friday that they had ""settled on agreeable terms"" to allow rugby league convert Burgess to return to the 13-man code and rejoin Australian side South Sydney Rabbitohs.
The momentum appeared to swing London Irish's way in the 20th minute when Bath flanker Alafoti Fa'osiliva was yellow carded for a late tackle and the Exiles were awarded a penalty try.
However, replays showed that in the build-up, Irish scrum-half McKibbin had stamped on Henry Thomas - for which referee Tom Foley brandished a red card and the penalty try was chalked off.
The effect of the extra man was not immediately apparent as, within five minutes of Faosiliva's return, Ollie Devoto was then sin-binned too for a late shoulder charge on Shane Geraghty.
But Bath raced out of the traps after the break when Fa'osiliva and centre Kyle Eastmond touched down within two minutes of each other.
Once fellow centre Devoto had returned to bring the visitors back up to their full complement of players, there was no doubt about the end result.
A first try for the club from Priestland after a strong diagonal run followed and, when Asaeli Tikoirotuma failed to deal with Semesa Rokoduguni's chipped kick, Nikola Matawalu finished things off.

The former governor, who was elected in 2010,  has not been seen since a week after he stepped down amid allegations of corruption.
He has been charged with organised crime and money laundering, but there are calls for the Attorney General's office to file criminal charges relating to the latest accusations.

The experiment is based on Alan Turing's question-and-answer game Can Machines Think?
No computer has passed the test before under these conditions, it is reported.
However, some artificial intelligence experts have disputed the victory, suggesting the contest had been weighted in the chatbot's favour.
The 65-year-old Turing Test is successfully passed if a computer is mistaken for a human more than 30% of the time during a series of five-minute keyboard conversations.
On 7 June Eugene convinced 33% of the judges at the Royal Society in London that it was human.
Other artificial intelligence (AI) systems also competed, including Cleverbot, Elbot and Ultra Hal.
Judges included actor Robert Llewellyn, who played an intelligent robot in BBC Two's  science-fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lord Sharkey, who led the successful campaign for Alan Turing's posthumous pardon, over a conviction for homosexual activity, in 2013.
Eugene was created by Vladimir Veselov, who was born in Russia and now lives in the United States, and Ukrainian-born Eugene Demchenko, who now lives in Russia.
Transcripts of the conversations are currently unavailable, but may appear in a future academic paper.
The judges and hidden human control groups were kept apart throughout the test.
The event was organised by Reading University's School of Systems Engineering in partnership with RoboLaw, an EU-funded organisation examining the regulation of emerging robotic technologies.
Alan Turing was an English mathematician, wartime code-breaker and pioneer of computer science.
The event has been labelled as ""historic"" by the organisers, who claim no computer has passed the test before.
""Some will claim that the Test has already been passed,"" said Kevin Warwick, a visiting professor at the University of Reading and deputy vice-chancellor for research at Coventry University.
""The words Turing test have been applied to similar competitions around the world. However, this event involved the most simultaneous comparison tests than ever before, was independently verified and, crucially, the conversations were unrestricted.
""A true Turing test does not set the questions or topics prior to the conversations. We are therefore proud to declare that Alan Turing's test was passed for the first time on Saturday.""
Prof Noel Sharkey, a leading expert in robotic technology and artificial intelligence, said: ""It is indeed a great achievement for Eugene. It was very clever ruse to pretend to be a 13-year-old Ukranian boy, which would constrain the conversation. But these competitions are really great to push developments.""
But others have criticised the claim.
""It's nonsense,"" Prof Stevan Harnad told the Guardian newspaper. ""We have not passed the Turing test. We are not even close.""
Hugh Loebner, creator of another Turing Test competition, has also criticised the University of Reading's experiment for only lasting five minutes.

418,420,"He is among thousands of Burmese Tamils living in the north-eastern Indian town of Moreh in Manipur state, which borders Myanmar, also known as Burma.
Mr Sarlan and other Indian-origin people were forced to leave the country following a military coup in the 1960s. Their businesses were nationalised and Mr Sarlan, who used to live in Rangoon (now called Yangon), and others became penniless refugees overnight.
It is estimated that nearly 300,000 Indians fled the country following the coup.
""After we reached India, for the first three months we were living in a refugee camp in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. Though Tamil Nadu was the land of our forefathers, it was difficult to live there without any support,"" recalls Mr Sarlan, 74, who is now a social activist.
'Mini-India'
Indians lived in Burma for centuries, but large-scale migration took place during British-colonial rule, when the country was part of British India, during the 19th and early 20th centuries. They were used as civil servants, traders, farmers, labourers and artisans - and came to be considered the backbone of the economy.
Burmese nationalists always viewed them with suspicion and there were a series of anti-Indian riots in the 1930s. Once the British left in 1948, Indian-origin people became increasingly vulnerable and they were swiftly forced to leave following the 1962 coup.
They found it difficult to settle in India, so many decided to return to Burma by land. They vaguely knew that India's north-eastern states of Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh shared a border with Burma.
After weeks of travelling by train and bus a small group managed to reach Moreh, around 3,200km (2,000 miles) by road from Tamil Nadu. When they reached the border crossing, Burmese soldiers prevented them from entering the country.
The Tamils settled in Moreh hoping one day to return to their homeland - but those dreams have never been fulfilled.
""Moreh was a tribal village when we first came here. There was hardly any infrastructure at that point. But many Burmese people came to Moreh looking for Indian goods like automobile parts, clothing and cosmetics. Since we knew the Burmese language it was easy for us to start businesses,"" Mr Sarlan recalls.
Soon, the Tamils in Moreh invited their relatives and friends from camps in Tamil Nadu and elsewhere to join them.
Many went on to become Indian citizens.
By the 1990s the number of Burmese Tamils in Moreh had increased to about 15,000, almost half of the town's population. They had set up their own schools, temples, churches and mosques - and celebrated their cultural festivals with fervour. Moreh was described as a ""mini-India"".
""We still retain lots of cultural and social links with Tamil Nadu state. For our important temple festivals we bring priests and music performers from there. Many parents in Moreh also send their children to schools in Tamil Nadu,"" says K Balasubramaniam, who is the principal of a local secondary school.
Chinese goods
At one point, Burmese Tamils dominated local border trade and that led to resentment from the Kuki community and others.
Several people were killed in bloody clashes between Tamils and Kukis in 1995, but relations have improved since then.
""We take part in each other's cultural and religious festivals. We have several committees to look into any problems and they get sorted out immediately,"" says Manohar Mohan, a Tamil businessman.
Tamil businesses suffered a setback after the Burmese government established a market just inside their border in Namphalong in the mid-1990s. Chinese products flooded in and many Burmese started shopping in Namphalong rather than Moreh.
Traders in Manipur also faced threats from insurgents in the state - some of the businessmen who refused to pay ""extortion money"" were shot dead.
The violence and lack of business opportunities forced many traders and Burmese Indians to leave Moreh, many opting for Chennai. Now Moreh's Tamil population is just 3,500.
'Gateway'
The insurgency has been contained to a large extent in the last few years. Many traders in Moreh hope the town will regain its business importance once the long-pending Asian Highway, linking the state capital Imphal with Yangon and Bangkok materialises.
Moreh is considered to be India's gateway to South East Asia and locals believe because of its unique geography the place offers tremendous potential.
The story of the town's Burmese Tamils is one of suffering and resilience as well as achievement.
Many elderly Tamils, originally from Burma, are nostalgic and want to stay in Moreh, as it is closer to where they come from.  But later generations say the town offers little in terms of education and employment.
""If we don't have the right education facilities then we have to go elsewhere. We can't do higher studies here. Also, girls can get only teaching jobs here in Moreh. So there are no other options but to leave this town and go to a place like Chennai,"" says B Revathy, a university student.

Towards the end of last year, however, the economy expanded by just over 5%, boosted by government spending.
President Joko Widodo had promised to lift annual growth to 7% on average.
However, the country has seen an average of just under 6% growth over the past decade and analysts have said growth is unlikely to improve for some time.
""The fourth quarter data is a positive surprise,"" economist Tony Nash told the BBC.
""But unfortunately the uptick will likely be short lived. We expect deterioration in the first quarter and it'll be tough to regain growth momentum before 2017,"" he added.
Mr Widodo made his promise to raise growth when his five-year term began in 2014, but he has faced problems boosting government spending and has seen several large infrastructure projects delayed.
A $5.5bn high-speed railway project, funded by China, was signed last year and is scheduled to be up and running by 2019.
But the project has faced widespread objections from transport experts and its long-term viability has been questioned.
Mr Widodo has also faced international condemnation for the country's man-made forest fires, which have caused serious economic and environmental damage.
In December, the World Bank said Indonesia's forest fires last year had likely cost the country more than twice the amount spent on reconstruction efforts after the 2004 Aceh tsunami.

Saturday's loss to Liverpool was the Swans' third in succession, leaving them a point above the bottom three and increasing the pressure on Guidolin.

However, they are compiling a shortlist of potential successors should they sack the Italian.
Chairman Huw Jenkins has met former United States coach Bob Bradley, while former Wales and Manchester United captain Ryan Giggs would be interested in the manager's role if it was to become vacant.
Bradley and Giggs are not the only options, with Swansea's hierarchy thought to be considering several other possible candidates in the event of Guidolin's departure.
It is likely the nature of Swansea's performances will have as much bearing on Guidolin's job prospects as the results, and the Swans were much improved against Liverpool.

422,424,"Eric, as it was called, was originally built in 1928, and was the UK's first humanoid robot, impressing audiences with his movement and speech.
He travelled the globe as a showcase for futuristic technology - but disappeared in the 1930s.
Now, the museum is trying to raise Â£35,000 to rebuild him and has received more than Â£6,000 in four days.
Eric was created by British duo Captain William H Richards and Alan Reffell. Made mostly from aluminium and weighing 45kg, he could stand, move his limbs and rotate his head.
Perhaps most impressive for the time, Eric could apparently respond to voice commands and ""speak"" - but only in carefully stage-managed appearances.
""Eric holds a unique place in our history. He was everything we now imagine a robot to be - a talking, moving mechanical person,"" Museum curator Ben Russell said.
The team behind the project tracked down relatives of Eric's inventor to collect as many documents as possible, including photographs, drawings and technical diagrams.
Working with robotics artist Giles Walker, the plan is to reconstruct Eric as faithfully as possible using modern components.
""It's one of our human instincts to anthropomorphise; we've built machines that look like us,"" Russell said in an interview with Wired Magazine.
""Robots are almost like mirrors, they reflect back on ourselves, tell us who we are and how we are and what we think is important. When you take that long view you realise the places where you tend to find robots say a lot about the time and why they were important.""
Eric was first built at short notice for the London Engineering Exhibition of 1928, when the keynote speaker dropped out of his opening address. Instead, the robot was scheduled to make the opening speech.
Writing about the unveiling at the time, Popular Science Monthly said: ""The Thing's enormous size and the stark immobility of his face gave him a really terrifying quality... [the crowd] returned his lifeless gaze.
""They felt subconsciously that here was some strange symbol of relentless Fate itself.""
Eric stood up and began his speech as any human might: ""Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, it gives me great pleasure...""
Robots, at the time, were a relatively new concept. Mechanical automatons had existed for many years, but the term ""robot"" was coined in a 1920 play ""RUR"" by Czech writer Karel Capek. Those letters - for Rossum's Universal Robots - appeared on Eric's chestplate.
The mechanical man proved a hit with audiences and Eric went on tour to technology exhibitions across the world, from Germany to New York.
Some time in the 1930s, however, he disappeared without explanation: lost, dumped, or possibly recycled.
If the museum's project is completed, Eric will form the centrepiece of a new robotic exhibition, which is due to run from February to September 2017.

There has been some uncertainty in recent years whether the team, based at RAF Scampton, would be retained.
Sir Michael said: ""They are a key part of our defence engagement..., and I don't think the public would let us lose the Red Arrows.""
There has been speculation in the media in recent years that the Red Arrows could be axed as part of defence cuts in the UK.
In 2014, The Express reported the Queen was said to be worried about the team's future.
Politicians, including Labour's Vernon Coaker, have also previously said there can be no guarantees.
Speaking to BBC Look North, Sir Michael said: ""Eventually we will have to replace the aircraft, and we will start to think about that in the next year or two.""
He said any attempts to axe the team is ""not a fight I would have"".
The Red Arrows is currently taking part in a 60-day world tour aiming to promote ""the best of British"", which includes its first ever display in China.
RAF Waddington, Cranwell and Scampton are all holding events marking 100 years in the county.
Sir Michael added that ""Lincolnshire is central to the RAF's story, and has a proud history"".
He cited the Dambusters' role in World War Two, and the Vulcan involvement in the Falklands conflict, and the work being done today to tackle terrorism in the Middle East.

They are accused of forcing Mr Hughes, 46, and another man - referred to as Mr K - to work for tiny sums.
Mr Connors senior described how he had met Michael Hughes when he was 18, and offered him work.
He said Mr Hughes, originally from Aberdeen, had stayed in his daughter's bedroom, then moved to a converted garage with a shower.
The court heard that Mr Hughes was paid £20 a day, which went up to £50 as he became a more skilled labourer.
Mr Connors senior described how Mr Hughes used to buy sweets for the youngest of his children, who called him brother.
He denied assaulting Mr Hughes during the time he was working with him.

Mr Maduro also denied that there was a political fight for the succession.
President Chavez was due to be sworn in on 10 January for a fourth term.
The Supreme Court ruled he could take the oath at a later date, a view challenged by opposition figures.
""There is only one president: Hugo Rafael Chavez Frias, supreme commander of the army, commander of the Bolivarian Revolution,"" Mr Maduro told legislators.
He also used his speech to announce that the Mr Chavez had appointed former vice-president Elias Jaua as Venezuela's new foreign minister.
The post was previously held by Mr Maduro.
The vice-president saluted National Assembly president, Diosdado Cabello, and dismissed rumours that they are political rivals.
""They say Cabello and I are fighting. But Cabello and I are united in our heart, in loyalty to a man who has the supreme command of this country.""
The vice-president said that his appearance to give the state of the union address was in accordance with the constitution, as Mr Chavez had been granted leave of absence by the National Assembly.
This view was challenged by some legal experts - they highlight Article 237 of the Constitution, which stipulates that the president should appear ""personally"" to give the speech within 10 days of the inauguration of the legislature.
The current assembly was sworn in on 5 January.
Within 10 days of the inauguration of the National Assembly, in routine session, the President of the Republic shall personally present, each year, to the Assembly a message in which they give account of the political, economic and administrative aspects of their administration during the previous year.
BBC's Sarah Grainger in Caracas says that the speech, which in Mr Chavez's hands could go on for hours, lasted a matter of minutes with Mr Maduro.
President Chavez underwent a fourth operation for cancer on 11 December, and suffered post-operative complications.
Mr Maduro told legislators he had met Mr Chavez in Havana on Monday and that his health was improving.
""He is climbing the hill, he is fighting with his spirit, his vision, his love,"" said Mr Maduro, adding that Mr Chavez has been briefed on developments in Venezuela.
Supreme Court justices have ruled that Mr Chavez, who has been in office since 1999, can be sworn in for another term as president at a later date.
Opposition leaders say the government is riding rough-shod over the constitution and have demanded clarity about who is running the country.

426,428,"""Nobody risks £15,000 on a hunch,"" said a spokesman for William Hill, who make the band 6/4 favourites to get the gig.
Ladbrokes, Coral and Paddy Power have also suspended betting.
A spokesman for Radiohead said he had ""no comment"" on whether the band would be performing the Spectre title track.
Bond star Daniel Craig is known to be a Radiohead fan, having quizzed frontman Thom Yorke for Interview magazine in 2013.
Speculation about whom will sing the song has been feverish in recent days, with Ellie Goulding emerging as another favourite.
The star posted a photo on Monday that appeared to hint she had been chosen.
""That's a wrap!"" the singer wrote on Instagram, next to a photograph of her leaving Abbey Road studios in London.
The historic recording facility was where Adele recorded the title track for Skyfall, the previous James Bond film, in 2012.
The Showbiz 411 website reported on Tuesday that Goulding had registered a song called Spy with music rights organisation BMI, a song it suggested was the theme song for Spectre.
According to NME, though, a spokesman for the singer later confirmed she had been working on her new studio album at Abbey Road.
""The first gamble of the day was Ellie Goulding and punters were backing her as if she already had the gig,"" said William Hill's Rupert Adams on Tuesday.
""But just as we were thinking of pulling the plug we had a load of bets for Radiohead, including one customer who asked to place a £15,000 bet on the band at 10/1.""
If Yorke's band are chosen to record the title track for Spectre, it would be the first group to sing a James Bond title song this century.
The last band to have that honour was Garbage, who performed the title track for The World is Not Enough, in 1999.
The makers of Spectre have yet to announce who will sing the song, though director Sam Mendes has confirmed a song has been recorded.
""It's fantastic and I'm very excited about it,"" he told BBC Radio's Test Match Special. ""You won't have to wait long.""
Sam Smith, another mooted candidate, denied rumours he would be singing the theme tune earlier this month.
""People seem to think I'm doing it but I have no idea what's going on,"" he told Capital FM. ""I think I would know by now.""
A spokeswoman for Coral told the BBC the bookmaker had decided to suspend betting on Tuesday following Goulding's cryptic hint.
A spokesman for Paddy Power said it had not accepted any bets since Mendes' confirmation that an artist had been chosen, while Ladbrokes' spokeswoman said it suspended betting last week.

431,433,"A High Court judge in Belfast had ruled that the PSNI should not have facilitated illegal parades, and was wrong to think it did not have legal powers to stop them.
The ruling was quashed after an appeal.
The UK Supreme Court has now been asked to overturn the decision.
There were widespread loyalist protests across Northern Ireland after Belfast City Council decided not to fly the Union flag at the City Hall every day of the year in December 2012.
The protests included a weekly parade between east Belfast and City Hall, which passed the nationalist Short Strand area.
Critics accused the police of being too soft as some of the protests descended into violence.
The PSNI insisted it did not have the legal powers to stop them, and warned that doing so might have made the situation worse.
In April 2014, a judge in the High Court in Belfast upheld a claim by a Short Strand resident, who cannot be named to protect his safety, that the PSNI had failed in its legal duty to stop the parades.
The judge said the police had not understood the full scope of their powers and had facilitated illegal and sometimes violent parades, in breach of their legal duties.
That ruling was appealed by then Chief Constable Matt Baggott, and quashed by the Court of Appeal.
The legal battle moved to the UK Supreme Court in London on Tuesday.
A lawyer representing the unnamed resident, told five judges the PSNI had failed in its duty to enforce the law as set out in the Public Processions Northern Ireland Act (1998).
She argued that the Court of Appeal had no grounds to interfere and overturn the original trial decision as ""the evidence before the court was unimpeachable"".
The lawyer said there were ""evident flaws"" in the Court of Appeal decision and its analysis of the evidence.
Lord Neuberger, President of the Supreme Court, asked her: ""So you say that we should go back to the trial judge and, provided we concluded that there was evidence on which he could fairly reach the decision that he did, that we should reinstate his decision?""
She replied: ""Yes.""
But a lawyer representing the PSNI said the Court of Appeal had made the correct decision.
He said the context of the time the protests had taken place was important.
He told the court the police had been dealing with a series of sporadic unplanned protests at more than 80 locations across Northern Ireland.
He insisted there had been ""no error of law"" and that the police fully understood that they could have stopped the parades, but took an operational decision not to so.
He said the police believed that ""robust action"" could have made the situation worse and took a deliberate decision to secure evidence of offences committed and to prosecute offenders afterwards.
The lawyer referred to research by Queen's University, which recorded that 306 people had been convicted of flag-protest-related offences across Northern Ireland in the months after the protests.
""Many would have considered the police approach to policing these parades was successful, and that their policy of de-escalation succeeded,"" he said.

""We're asking the government to pass a law which says you cannot sell a ticket for more than 10%  of its face value,"" Goldsmith told the BBC.
Consumer magazine Which? also called for a crack-down on ticket resale sites earlier this month, arguing consumers face a ""stitch-up"".
The group spent eight weeks monitoring four of the biggest secondary ticketing websites and said it found ""some really unusual behaviour"".

433,435,"The regime had said the 22-year-old Otto Warmbier's coma was caused last year by botulism and a sleeping pill he took after his trial.
He has not spoken since his return to his family hometown in Ohio.
""His neurological condition can be best described as a state of unresponsive wakefulness,"" said Dr Daniel Kanter.
Mr Warmbier ""shows no understanding of language"" and has ""extensive loss of brain tissue"" which was likely caused by cardiopulmonary arrest, he said.
According to scans taken after he arrived at the Cincinnati Medical Center earlier this week, there is no sign that he was physically abused during his detention, his doctors say.
Mr Warmbier's condition is ""not what we normally see with traumatic brain injury. It's the type we see with cardiopulmonary arrest,"" Dr Kanter told reporters.
They believe respiratory arrest led to his condition, which is caused by a lack of oxygen and blood in the brain.
Earlier on Thursday, Mr Warmbier's father expressed doubts about the North Korean account of what caused the University of Virginia student's coma.
""Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing the coma - and we don't - there's no excuse for a civilised nation to have kept his condition secret and to have denied him top notch medical care.""
Otto Warmbier, an economics student from the University of Virginia, was arrested in January 2016 while visiting North Korea as a tourist.
He was given a 15-year prison sentence for attempting to steal a propaganda sign from a hotel.
Botulism is a type of poisoning which can cause total body paralysis, difficulty in breathing and death in some cases.
It's caused by the Clostridium botulinum bacteria, but the symptoms of botulism are not from the bacteria themselves.
Instead, the microscopic organisms produce a powerful toxin which attacks the nervous system and causes paralysis.
That poison is called botulinum - which you may know for its commercial use in Botox, which removes wrinkles by paralysing facial muscles.
Botulism is contracted in two ways in adults - by eating food contaminated with the toxin, or through wounds.
The foodborne method happens when the bacteria are tinned or stored in food in another way that deprives them from air (which is when they produce the poison).
This rarely happens in modern Western food production, but is what North Korea claims happened to Mr Warmbier.","A team of US doctors have found ""no sign of botulism"" in the American student freed by North Korea after more than 15 months in captivity.",40297248,"According to doctors, Otto Warmbier, an American student who was released from North Korean detention after 17 months, is in a state of unresponsive wakefulness with extensive loss of brain tissue, and his condition is believed to have been caused by cardiopulmonary arrest rather than botulism and a sleeping pill as claimed by the North Korean regime.",0,"Article: {}

Hoang, 56, admitted having joined an opposition group but said his writings were not aimed at overthrowing anyone.
Human rights activists say dozens of government critics in Vietnam have been given long jail terms in recent years.
France's foreign ministry had earlier voiced ""serious concern"" about Hoang's case.
His family has said he will appeal against the sentence.
His wife, Le Thi Kieu Oanh, said she was ""utterly shocked"" by the court's decision.
""I am losing hope... but as a wife, I will fight until the very end,"" she told the BBC's Newshour programme.
Hoang, who was said to have written 33 articles under the pen name Phan Kien Quoc, asked for leniency, saying he did not know he was breaking the law.

435,437,"Thunderstorms are short, sharp and shocking - for some literally.
If you can hear the clouds rumbling, chances are the storm is close enough for you to be hit by lightning - it can strike up to 10 miles away from the centre of a storm.
Count the seconds between seeing lightning and hearing thunder - if it is less than 30 seconds, there is a threat.
If thunderstorms are forecast, postpone or cancel outdoor activities - especially golf and rod fishing.
If a storm is approaching, take cover inside or in a car with the windows wound up - sheds, isolated trees and convertibles do not afford sufficient protection.
Boaters and swimmers should get to shore as quickly as possible, as water conducts electricity. So too do metal pipes and phone lines.
Unplug all non-essential appliances, including the television, as lightning can cause power surges.
Do not use candles if the lights go out, as this poses a fire risk, and instead use a torch.
Do not make phone calls, unless it is in an emergency, or put up an umbrella - the metal directs the current into the body.
It is also best to put off baths, showers and dish washing, in case lightning strikes the house and sends a jolt of electricity through the metal plumbing.
If caught outside in a thunderstorm, find a low spot away from trees, fences, and poles.
If your skin tingles and hair stands on end, lightning is about to strike.
Crouch down immediately, balancing on the balls of your feet, placing hands on knees with head between them.
This makes you into the smallest target possible, and minimises contact with the ground.
If someone has been hit by lightning, call for help as they will need urgent medical attention.
It is safe to touch them - people struck by lightning carry no electrical charge that can shock other people.
Check for a pulse and for breathing - if you know first aid, begin artificial respiration and CPR if necessary.
If they are breathing, check for other possible injuries.
Lightning strike victims have burns in two places - where the electric shock entered and then left the body, usually the soles of the feet.
They may have broken bones or loss of hearing or sight.
If waters start to rise, head for higher ground.
Do not try to drive to safety, as cars can float in as little as a couple of feet of water, the depth of which is often very difficult to judge.
Be wary of venturing out too soon - the BBC Weather Centre advises waiting 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning.
Avoid downed power lines or broken cables.
And one final tip - it is a myth that lightning never strikes the same place twice and always hits the tallest object.
Lightning strikes the best conductor on the ground - whether it has been struck before or not.

436,438,"Sterling did subsequently recover some of the losses.
But there is certainly a view that the currency would decline if Britain were to decide to leave.
Some analysts expect the fall in the value of sterling in the event of a Brexit vote would be very sharp .
The concern reflects the view held by many - though by no means all - economists that leaving the EU would undermine the UK's economic performance.
How trade and the UK's economy are affected by membership of the EU.
There would be a period of uncertainty about access to the EU market for British exporters while new arrangements were negotiated. The ultimate result could be that it would be harder to sell to the EU market. It is argued that foreign investment could be hit by the uncertainty.
This would be going on at a time when the UK has a large deficit in what is called ""the current account deficit"" - which is trade in goods and services plus some international financial transactions.
The deficit has to be financed by loans and foreign investment in financial assets. Unease about the economic outlook could mean that foreign investors would only provide the finance for the deficit if sterling were cheaper.
There is of course another view, reflected by Economists for Brexit that the UK would prosper outside the EU.
For the short term however, it is more likely to be the majority view that moves markets and sterling in particular.
Our reporting on the currency markets usually focuses on what's called the spot rates, the exchange rate that an investor pays to buy currency immediately.
But they can also buy options, which are rights to buy or sell a currency (or other types of financial asset) in the future at a price fixed in advance. It's a way of getting insurance against a move in the exchange rate. If the move you are worried about doesn't happen you don't exercise the option. So you are insured, but you have had to pay for it.
That part of the market suggests that investors do think a leave vote would weaken sterling. That was the message that the Bank of England Governor Mark Carney gave to a parliamentary committee back in March, in rather technical language:
""We have seen a marked increase in implied volatility in the options market around the date of the referendum, once the date became known, and the skews in the option market, in other words the purchase of downside protection if the pound was going to depreciate, had gone up quite sharply.""
In other words, more investors were buying insurance for the time of the referendum against a fall in the pound than a rise.
The Bank also says that about half the decline in sterling since November is due to news related to the referendum.
Here's another sign.
The financial news service Bloomberg calculates what it calls ""implied volatility"" from the options market. It shows a marked increase for the pound against the dollar as the referendum approaches.
John Redwood the Conservative MP and Brexit supporter looks at the sterling issue rather differently. He wrote in his blog: ""The pound fell from over $2 in 2008 to $1.4 in 2009 when we were firmly committed to the EU, so we know other influences can generate large sterling movements"".
And it must be said that Mark Carney fully recognises other factors have influenced sterling in recent months.
On the current account issue, Mr Redwood argues that the immediate impact would be beneficial:
""The first round effect is to improve the balance of payments by on fifth as we cancel the payments we have to make to the rest of the EU which we do not get back.""
The leading Brexit campaigner Boris Johnson also rejects the concerns about the impact on the pound from a leave vote:  ""The pound will go where it will over the short term. But, believe me, in the long term you can look forward to fantastic success for this countryâ€¦ I think the pound's value will depend entirely on the strength of the UK economy.""
It's also worth pointing out that a weaker pound now could be helpful to the British economy. It improves the competitiveness of British industry. It makes imported goods more expensive boosting inflation.

437,439,"It found children of minority families do not get enough support to learn Cantonese - putting them behind in school and causing long-term problems in the jobs market.
""One of the main barriers to equal access has been a de facto racial segregation of ethnic minority students from Chinese students in the public school system,"" says University of Hong Kong law professor, Puja Kapai, who carried out the study.
The practice of communities studying separately has also meant that children grow up without interacting with other cultures.
Hong Kong is home to 365,000 ethnic minority people, making up 6% of its total population. Communities of Indians, Pakistanis, Nepalese and Filipinos have lived in Hong Kong for generations.
But the city still lacks a curriculum for children speaking Chinese as a second language, which would enable them to learn Cantonese, a requirement for many jobs and university places.
""The language requirement that forms a barrier for ethnic minorities to receive equal access in education and the labour market, can be seen as an indirect form of discrimination,"" says Raymond Ho, a senior member of the Equal Opportunities Commission in Hong Kong.
But he is confident that since the government made it unlawful to discriminate on the grounds of race in 2009, there is more public awareness of the needs of ethnic minorities.
More stories from the BBC's Knowledge economy series looking at education from a global perspective and how to get in touch
In the past there have been claims that Chinese locals are ""less accepting"" of people with darker skin. That was the claim of a report in 2008 from Unison, a group that campaigns for the rights of ethnic minorities.
This acceptance level was found to be lowest in the education sector.
Language is a major barrier for ethnic minorities to access education.
The best place to start learning Chinese and meeting people of other backgrounds is in kindergarten, says Holing Yip from Unison.
But Unison's study Kindergarten Support Report 2015 showed that 62% of kindergartens used Cantonese exclusively as the interview language.
It also found that privately-run kindergartens were reluctant to give application forms to non-Chinese parents, and many ask children to have Chinese speaking skills by age three.
As a result, there is a concentration of ethnic minorities in a small number of kindergartens.
Mr Ho says the Equal Opportunities Commission has been ""encouraging kindergartens to be open to ethnic minorities.  But also not to use language ability as a selection criteria"".
There has been a pattern of Chinese students enrolling in mainstream primary and secondary schools, where classes are taught in Cantonese.
Ethnic minorities would enrol in English-medium ""designated schools"".
But the designated schools equipped students with such a low level of Cantonese that they would find it hard to enter university or employment.
As such some parents choose to send their children to Cantonese-medium schools.
""Having struggled themselves, many ethnic minority parents want their children to learn Cantonese so they don't go through what they did,"" says Ms Yip.
But getting information about how to apply to Chinese-medium schools is often only available in Chinese. Some have discouraged ethnic minority parents from applying.
Those who get places can struggle, as all classes are in Cantonese with no extra support in class and parents are unable to help at home.
Many parents are forced to seek extra tuition to help children with homework.
""There are situations where if a tutor can't come one day, their children won't be able to hand in their homework and will be penalised. It's also a huge financial burden,"" says Ms Yip.
Chinese University of Hong Kong student Deepen Nebhwani attended both types of schools.
""I learnt more Chinese in the mainstream school where all my friends were Chinese, just by practising it outside of class, than I did at the designated school where I studied Cantonese as a language class.""
After pressure from local non-governmental organisations and the United Nations, the Hong Kong government disbanded designated schools in 2013.
But the tendency to send ethnic minority children to particular schools continues.
""Ultimately, parents are faced with the decision of whether their children should suffer now in a Chinese-medium school, or later in the labour market. And that's not a fair choice for a parent to have to make,"" says Ms Yip.
In September 2014, the Hong Kong government took a step forward by introducing a ""learning framework"" aimed at supporting ethnic minority students in learning Cantonese.
Depending on the number of ethnic minority students enrolled, schools can receive from HK$800,000 (Â£68,000) to HK$1,500,000 to help them.
But Prof Kapai is sceptical about its effectiveness.
""It has simply broken the curriculum down into steps, but nothing has actually changed. There needs to be a Chinese as a second language curriculum to teach non-native speakers how to learn Cantonese properly,"" she says.
""Ethnic minorities may still be struggling with subjects such as maths as a result of the class and material being in Chinese,"" says Unison's Ms Yip
Prof Kapai's report emphasises interlinked problems for minority groups.
A lack of Cantonese language skills will present barriers in employment, leading to an increase in poverty, and difficulty accessing healthcare.
Cantonese language proficiency is a core requirement for some jobs, such as the civil service.
Typical occupations taken up by ethnic minorities are in the catering, construction and manual labour industries.
The Hong Kong Council of Social Welfare says that many Pakistani, Indonesian and Thai households are below the city's poverty rate.
""I identify as a Hongkonger,"" says Mr Nebhwani. But he is excluded from many jobs because of the limitations of his language skills.
""If I were to try and completely integrate, it would be hard because of my level of Cantonese.""
""The government is committed to encouraging and supporting non-Chinese speaking students' integration into the community, including facilitating their early adaptation to the school education system and mastery of the Chinese language,"" said a spokesperson for Hong Kong's education bureau.","Ethnic minorities in Hong Kong are ""marginalised"" by the education system, says a university study.",34444284,"According to a study by the University of Hong Kong, children of minority families face significant barriers in learning Cantonese, which hinders their academic performance and future job prospects, and the government's efforts to address the issue have been deemed insufficient.",0,"Article: {}

The nursery, which was not named in the judge's ruling, complained that the reviews were making serious and unfounded claims that it was neglecting children, and that this was harming its business.
Three of the reviews were removed by Google for breaching its anti-spam rules after the nursery complained, including one written in the name of a woman who died in the US in November 2006. Others were found to have been copied and pasted from other websites.
In a ruling handed down last week, the judge CM Berkhout ordered the fourth to be removed because it too was in breach of the rules.

They accused the authorities of covering up the alleged involvement of high-ranking officials and possibly the army in the killings.
The case shocked Mexico and led to weeks of protests against official impunity and the government of President Enrique Pena Nieto.
Analysis: By Katy Watson, BBC News, Mexico City
This report confirms what many people have believed for a long time - that the government's investigation into the disappearance of the 43 students was deeply flawed.
The families of the missing disagreed from the start with the government's version of events - now they've been vindicated.
There is a lot that is still unknown - the report doesn't explain what happened to the students and only suggests possible motives.
But what is clear is that the government needs to step up its efforts to get to the bottom of what actually happened.  President Enrique Pena Nieto has been hugely criticised for his handling of this case - this report will heap yet more pressure on him.
After a six-month investigation, the Washington-based IACHR released a report of nearly 500 pages urging the government to continue looking for the missing students.
A Peruvian fire expert hired by the commission concluded that it was impossible for all the bodies to have been burned at the landfill site in the municipality of Cocula, in the western state of Guerrero.
Jose Torero, from the University of Queensland in Australia, said it would have required 13 tonnes of tyres, 20 tonnes of wood and 13 tonnes of diesel to cremate the bodies.
It would have taken the gang 60 hours to finish the job, he said.
""There is no evidence indicating the presence of a fire of the size [needed] for the cremation of even one body,"" Mr Torero concluded.
The original probe said the trainee teachers were rounded up by corrupt policemen after travelling to the city of Iguala on 26 September and taking part in a protest over job discrimination.
They are reported to have disrupted a rally planned by the mayor's wife later in the evening.
They were then allegedly handed over to the local Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) criminal gang, which was told to kill them and dispose of their bodies.
Several people were arrested in the following days, including the mayor, his wife, local policemen and men accused of belonging to the local gang.

442,444,"Around one in four births in the UK is by C-section, while in Cyprus the figure is 52% and in Sweden 17%.
The study of 26 European countries, published in the journal BJOG, said more research was needed to find out why the differences existed.
The Royal College of Midwives said health systems had a role to play.
The study, led by researchers at City University London said that Caesarean section rates in most EU countries have shown ""a continuous rise"", although in a few countries there are signs they are flattening out.
It said there could be several possible explanations for this - ""including a fear of litigation, financial incentives, women's requests for Caesarean section and the perception that Caesarean section is a safe procedure"".
The study also said there were consequences to the rise, which included potential raised risks for mothers and babies - such as stillbirth - in future pregnancies.
Caesareans are more likely when babies are born to first-time mothers, when women have multiple births or when the woman in question has already had a Caesarean.
However, there is continuing debate, the study said, about the use of Caesarean section for babies who are breech (feet first), for multiple births and women who have had a C-section already.
In the study, the highest rate of Caesarean sections planned before labour started was in Cyprus at 38.8% and in Italy at 25%.
The lowest rates were found in Finland (6.6%), the Netherlands (7.7%) and Norway (6.6%).
In the UK, planned Caesarean rates are 9% in England, 11% in Wales and Scotland and 14.6% in Northern Ireland.
Emergency C-section rates were highest in Romania at 33% and lowest in Sweden at 8.6%.
In all four countries of the UK, emergency rates are around 15%.
Prof Alison Macfarlane, professor of perinatal health at City University London, said: ""Given that people are supposed to be practising according to evidence, it is surprising there are such wide variations between countries.
""We need a comparative review of national policies and guidelines and further research to ensure that clinical practice is based on evidence.""
She said it was important that the health of mothers and children was also prioritised.
Gail Johnson, professional advisor for education and research at the Royal College of Midwives, said the disparities were likely to be due to differences in health service models and the overall health of different populations.
She said the percentage of women giving birth by Caesarean in the UK was still ""a bit too high"".
""A Caesarean is an emergency procedure, done when a normal birth isn't going to work.

Boston College has been issued with a subpoena instructing it to hand over the material on 6 May.
Mr McIntyre said he had engaged a lawyer to ""resist the efforts to raid his personal memoirs"".
Dozens of loyalists and republicans provided testimonies to Boston College staff compiling an oral history of the Northern Ireland conflict.
What are the 'Boston tapes'?
Dozens of former paramilitaries were interviewed in Belfast and other cities and towns from 2001-2006 as part of an oral history project known as the Belfast Project.
Details about internal politics and activities of the IRA were revealed on tape, including accounts of a hunger strike in prison in the 1980s.
Overall, the project cost about $200,000 (Â£118,520), mostly provided by an Irish-American businessman.
Each interview was transcribed, sent by encrypted email to New York and then the material was sent to Boston College, where it was placed under lock and key at Burns Library.
Following a lengthy legal battle with the college, the Police Service of Northern Ireland gained access to a small number of the interviews in 2013.
Interviews were given on the understanding that tapes would not be made public until after their deaths.
Detectives want to access the recordings as part of their investigations into murder and other paramilitary crimes from the 1970s to 1990s.
In June last year, police were given access to interviews given by former loyalist prisoner Winston Rea.
It followed a decision by senior judges in Belfast to lift an injunction on the PSNI taking possession of Mr Rea's recorded account to Boston College researchers.

A government spokesperson said most UK homes can get ""superfast"" broadband.
""Almost nine out of ten UK properties has access to superfast speeds and 95% of the UK will be reached by 2017,"" a spokesperson for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport told the BBC.

""Now is the time to set a bold new target for genuinely world-beating broadband,"" said Dan Lewis, senior advisor on Infrastructure Policy at the IoD, and author of the report.
""We have the leading internet economy in the G20, and yet download speeds are mediocre and the coverage of fibre optic cable is woeful.""
He added: ""Unfortunately, the Government's current target displays a distinct poverty of ambition.""
Mr Lewis said the government needed to look at how the UK could provide the physical infrastructure needed to maintain a position ""at the forefront of digital innovation in business"".
IoD members interviewed for the report said that better broadband speeds could increase their company's productivity, make them more competitive, and enable them to offer more flexible working to their staff.

Ofcom also said there was a digital divide in the UK between those with the latest technologies, and those without.
It has proposed that decent, affordable broadband should be a universal right.
Rivals had called for a split between BT and its Openreach operation, which runs its cables, fibre and network infrastructure.

At the High Court in Glasgow, James Clark, 36, was jailed for a least 22 years after being convicted of murder.
His brother John, 38, was jailed for 10 years after being convicted of the lesser charge of culpable homicide.
Jailing both men, judge Bill Dunlop told the brothers that they had carried out ""a merciless, relentless and savage attack"".
He rejected any suggestion that Mr Bryden had been laying in wait for them armed with a samurai sword.
Judge Dunlop added: ""You together planned to gain illegal access with at least one knife and nunchucks.

""To be taken at the age of 38, in such horrifying circumstances, is a heartbreaking situation that the family has been forced to endure.""
The court previously heard the brothers, from Kilmarnock, had decided to rob Mr Bryden of a gold bracelet which they had given to him in exchange for drugs.
The pair, who were high on drink and drugs, went to his home after masking their faces with scarves and arming themselves with a knife and martial arts nunchucks.

But Bristol have lost all seven top-flight games so far this season, leaving them bottom of the table.
The 52-year-old former England and Scotland head coach has been in charge at Bristol since 2013.
Robinson only signed a new three-year contract with the Ashton Gate side in August, but they have since lost all nine of their competitive fixtures - including two in the European Challenge Cup.
A club statement said: ""Bristol Rugby have decided, following the extremely disappointing start to the season, to appoint Mark Tainton as acting head coach with immediate effect.""
Kicking coach Tainton, who joined Bristol prior to the start of the season, has previously worked at London Irish, Wasps and for the Ireland national team coaching staff.

Since Bristol's long-awaited return to the top flight began with an encouraging 21-19 loss at Harlequins on the opening day, both results and performances have failed to meet expectations.
A heavy 70-22 defeat at Wasps on 18 September set the tone for a defence which has conceded 34 tries in seven league games.
Injuries have undoubtedly hampered Robinson's side, with 15 senior players ruled out of October's Challenge Cup loss at local rivals Bath.

452,454,"Sir Keir Starmer said there was a ""very strong case"" for the Crown Prosecution Service to make the final decision on whether to prosecute cases.
Currently, police forces in England and Wales decide whether to pass a case on to the CPS after investigating a death.
The CPS said cases should be referred to a prosecutor as early as possible.
Department of Transport figures show 113 cyclists were killed in the UK last year.
Last year a Freedom of Information request by BBC's Newsbeat found that between 2007 and 2014 there were 276 recorded incidents where a cyclist was killed in an accident involving a motor vehicle.
Of these, 148 - 54% - resulted in the driver of the vehicle being charged with an offence. Of those found guilty, fewer than half went to prison.
Sir Keir, now a Labour MP, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that if a death was involved and it was serious enough to have had a criminal investigation ""then it really ought to go off to the CPS for the final decision"".
In Scotland, if evidence suggests the driver is to blame for a collision that leads to a cyclist's death, a report is to be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal.
But data compiled from a 2014 freedom of information request to Police Scotland suggests this happened in only a small number of cases.
Cycling campaigners are calling for a change in liability - who is considered responsible for a collision - in civil cases.
At the moment there is no presumption on either side.
Last year, my dad Mick was killed as he cycled through central London.
After three weeks in a coma, he died.
At the inquest the driver said the first she realised was when she heard a noise, like something falling from the sky. The coroner returned a verdict of accidental death.
We had questions about how the police were investigating from very early on. Potential witnesses weren't chased as we would have liked and we felt they just didn't think about what we were going through.
A year on from my dad's death we held a vigil at the spot where his crash happened.
That day, the police told a journalist they would pass the case to prosecutors - which could lead to a trial. It felt like progress.
But this changed just four days later when police again went straight to the journalist, saying the case was actually closed.
I still want to know more about what happened on the night of my dad's crash and the only option for my family is a private prosecution.
The Met Police said they followed all available lines of enquiry in this case.
Rhia Favero, from the cycling charity CTC, said it supported the argument of ""presumed liability"" - placing the onus on the driver to demonstrate they were only partially liable for an accident.
""Currently it's often on the victim to prove liability - which seems very unfair, "" she said.
Sir Keir said the debate over liability had been going on for some time.
""You have to be very careful with this - and I certainly wouldn't want to go to strict liability where it's automatically thought one party is at fault - but we may need to start looking again at that balance,"" he said.
How safe is cycling?
A senior lawyer who has dealt with a number of cases involving cyclists said he thought it was problematic that some senior police officers have said they would not commute on a bike in the capital.
Martin Porter QC said:  ""They're looking at cycling as a dangerous activity. Their emphasis then, and the emphasis of some coroners, is upon whether a cyclist is wearing a crash helmet or high visibility equipment, rather than on whether the people driving in the vicinity of vulnerable road users like cyclists are taking the appropriate amount of care not to collide with them.""
Suzette Davenport, roads policing lead for National Police Chiefs' Council, said: ""I wouldn't do that, because it's too busy, there are too many risks.
""One of the things as a police officer, but also in my roads policing role, is my sense of risk is so heightened because of what we deal with on a day-to-day basis. We know there are a range of people who don't go home at the end of the day.""
The head of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has also previously said he would not cycle in London.
A CPS spokeswoman said the police could make the decision to take no further action.
She added: ""Guidelines on early investigative advice state that specific cases, including those involving a death, should always be referred to an Area Prosecutor as early as possible.""
The Victoria Derbyshire programme is broadcast on weekdays between 09:15 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.","The way cycling deaths are treated by police and prosecutors may need to change, the former Director of Public Prosecutions has said.",34604622,"Sure!

453,455,"Tumours in the ovaries are hard to detect in the earliest stages meaning it can be too late to treat them effectively by the time they are found.
A trial of 4,051 women, reported in the journal Cancer, showed the method could identify those needing treatment.
But a huge study taking place in the UK will give a final verdict on the test when it is completed in 2015.
There is a survival rate of up to 90% when ovarian cancer is caught early, compared with less than 30% if it is discovered in the later stages.
Unlike other cancers, the symptoms, such as pelvic and abdominal pain or persistent bloating, are often put down to other common ailments and the tumour can be missed.
There is no mass screening programme to detect the cancer either.
Scientists already know that levels of a protein in the blood, called CA125, are often higher with ovarian cancer.
However, it is too unreliable on its own. It misses some patients and tells others they have the cancer when they are actually healthy.
Researchers are now testing the idea of using the blood test to sort patients in risk groups based on levels of CA125. Instead of going straight for surgery, low-risk patients are tested again in a year, medium-risk ones after three months and high-risk patients have an ultrasound scan to hunt for tumours.
The US study, at the University of Texas, followed post-menopausal women for 11 years on average.
Ten women had surgery based on their ultrasound scan and all the cancers detected were at an early stage.
Researcher Dr Karen Lu told the BBC: ""Clinical practice definitely should not change from our study, but it gives us an insight - we didn't get a lot of false positives.""
She said the UK study of 50,000 people would give definitive results: ""There are two big questions - do we see cancers at an earlier stage and do we decrease the number of deaths.""
Dr Sarah Blagden, from the Ovarian Cancer Action research centre, said: ""Relative to the trial under way in the in the UK , this is a small study, but it does show that effective ovarian screening is possible.
""In 2015 the results of the UKCTOCs study will become available and the results are eagerly anticipated, more so now that this American study has produced such encouraging results.""
Annwen Jones, the chief executive at Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""The results of this study are without doubt very positive, and we should take hope from that.

As many as seven million Americans who do not already have health insurance are eligible to purchase coverage in the coming months.
Republican opposition to the law led to the government shutdown on Tuesday.
At the White House on Tuesday, Mr Obama said the opportunity would be ""life changing"" for the ""15% of Americans who don't have health insurance"".
""Tens of thousands of Americans die each year just because they don't have health insurance,"" Mr Obama said, with Americans set to sign up for plans standing behind him.
""Millions more live with the fear that they'll go broke if they get sick. And today, we begin to free millions of our fellow Americans from that fear.""
While Mr Obama and his supporters in the Democratic Party portray the law as a historic effort to extend healthcare coverage to the millions of Americans who lack it, the law's opponents say it amounts to an unprecedented intrusion into Americans' private lives.
The online health insurance marketplaces, or exchanges, struggled to meet higher than expected demand on Tuesday, with many users reporting long waiting times.
Health and Human Services spokeswoman Joanne Peters told the Associated Press news agency the agency was ""prepared to make adjustments as needed [to] improve the consumer experience"".
Users also reported errors while trying to create accounts and site crashes on the websites.
""The first day of something that you know is going to have a lot of bugs, it's not that frustrating,"" Mike Weaver, a self-employed photographer without insurance told the Associated Press.
""If it was the last day to sign up... then I'd be terribly frustrated.""
Mr Obama acknowledged the glitches and delays.
""We found out that there have been times this morning where the site has been running more slowly than it normally will,"" Mr Obama said.
""The reason is because more than one million people visited healthcare.gov before 7:00 in the morning.""
The exchanges will continue to enrol people through the end of the year for healthcare plans slated to begin next year.
The opening of the exchanges was the culmination of more than three years of political combat in Washington over the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, signed into law by Mr Obama in 2010 and known to both sides as Obamacare.
Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country have fought hard to undermine or undo the law since its passage, with the US House of Representatives taking dozens of symbolic votes to repeal it or eliminate its funding.
A legal challenge led by the law's Republican opponents ended in June 2012 when the Supreme Court validated the law's keystone provision - a requirement that Americans not receiving health coverage from their employers or the government purchase individual plans or pay a fine.
That requirement, known as the individual mandate, takes effect in January.
The healthcare law was also a central issue in the 2012 presidential election. Republican candidate Mitt Romney vowed to press for its repeal. Mr Obama handily won re-election.
On Tuesday, the US government shut non-essential services, keeping more than 700,000 workers at home, when the Democrats who control the Senate refused to agree to Republican demands to repeal the health law or delay the individual mandate.
Both Mr Obama and congressional Democrats have said they will not negotiate on Obamacare, with Mr Obama on Monday evening accusing the Republicans of attempting to refight the last election.
In spite of the political turmoil in Washington, on Tuesday Americans were able to enrol in insurance plans offered by private companies and ranging in price and level of coverage through exchanges in every state.
Sixteen states and Washington DC have opted to operate their own exchanges, while the exchanges in 34 states will be fully or partially run by the federal government.
Exchanges will also inform customers of tax subsidies available to ease the cost of the insurance. An estimated six million US citizens are expected to qualify.
Customers enrolling under Obamacare will not be covered by the insurance until 1 January however.
That corresponds with the start of the individual mandate, as well as consumer protections including a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing health conditions.
Several Obamacare provisions had taken effect prior to Tuesday, including prescription drug discounts for pensioners, a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance plans up to age 26, a rule barring insurers from denying coverage to children with pre-existing health conditions, and a ban on lifetime limits on health coverage.
Another major provision known as the employer mandate - which requires employers with at least 50 full-time workers to provide insurance or incur a $2,000 (Â£1,320) per employee penalty - has been delayed until 2015.
That delay, announced by the Obama administration in July, has been seen as a concession to retailers and other businesses - and an acknowledgement that the health law was not fully ready for implementation.","A central provision of President Barack Obama's healthcare reform law has taken effect, having survived Republicans' years-long effort to undermine it.",24353675,"The Affordable Care Act's online health insurance marketplaces opened for enrollment on Tuesday, with millions of Americans becoming eligible to purchase coverage, despite glitches and delays, and the law's opponents continuing to fight against it.",0,"Article: {}

Flower, 26, punched Hohaia to the ground two minutes into Saturday's Grand Final, then landed a second blow to his face while he lay on the ground.
Wales prop Flower was sent off as the Warriors were beaten 14-6.
The ban until 14 April takes in 10 Super League games and the World Club Series match against Brisbane Broncos.
New Zealander Hohaia had already accepted a one-game suspension for a forearm strike which came before Flower's punches.
Flower was charged with a Grade F offence - the most serious in the sport's disciplinary rules - of ""violent and aggressive punching"" and ""punching an off-guard opponent"", a charge which carries a minimum of an eight-game ban.
Wigan rugby general manager Kris Radlinski, who accompanied Flower to the hearing at the Rugby Football League in Leeds, said in a statement: ""Wigan Warriors would like to go on record in saying that the RFL disciplinary committee handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and integrity.
""We fully support their assessment of Saturday night's incident involving our player, Ben Flower. We will be making no appeal.
""We would like to apologise to Lance Hohaia and his family and to the St Helens club and fans. St Helens' win on Saturday has been overshadowed by the incident and that is wrong.""
In becoming the first man to be sent off in a Grand Final, Flower left his side down to 12 men for the vast majority of the match at Old Trafford, which St Helens won to end an eight-year wait for the Super League title.
Saints chairman Eamonn McManus said: ""The sport of rugby league should not be judged by this event, but by how it deals with it.
""We must assist [Flower] in any way that we can and accept him back into the sport. There is a person behind the player, and I am reliably informed by all that it is a good one.""
For Wigan, the defeat ended their defence of the Super League crown and the pursuit of a fourth title.
Former Wigan and Great Britain player Martin Offiah told BBC Radio 5 live: ""There is a lot of emotion around what was a big occasion but sadly it was in effect ruined by this incident in which I believe both players played their part. It was a sad day for rugby league.
""The sport was on show, it's a big event and the pictures are very graphic and all the apologies in the world won't wipe these away.

The National Geology and Mines Service issued a red alert after Thursday's eruption, warning that the volcano remained unstable.

465,467,"If, and when, their big day comes, it could be an expensive business covering the cost of hotels, caterers, photographers and florists, not to mention clothes, rings and a honeymoon.
Campaigners estimate that the average Australian wedding has a price tag of around 35,000 Australian dollars ($27,000; Â£18,000).
""The world's expert body on the economic impact of marriage equality, the Williams Institute at UCLA, says the most conservative estimate for the [potential] wedding spend of Australian same-sex couples is A$161m,"" says Rodney Croome, the national director of Australian Marriage Equality.
""It could be as high as A$600m.
""On top of this, Australia's failure to achieve marriage equality is a competitive disadvantage when it comes to attracting those skilled migrants and investors for whom non-discriminatory laws are important.""
This week the campaign for reform in Australia received some high-profile support from Alan Joyce, the openly gay, Irish-born chief executive of the airline Qantas.
He told the Sydney Morning Herald: ""I've had people coming up to me in the business community and saying that their son, their daughter is finding it tough (being gay), even in this day and age.
""Talking about how important it is for a business leader ... to express our views on things. It is a role model thing.""
The Flying Kangaroo has a long tradition of equality for its staff.
Tim Harcourt, an economist at the University of New South Wales Business School, says Australia's national airline has been a beacon of progressive thinking.
""When I worked at Qantas they were always ahead of the game in providing benefits for same-sex partners, whether it be travel or superannuation or so on,""  he tells the BBC.
""It has worked out pretty well on the basis that having a happy and egalitarian workforce is good for productivity.""
Other corporate heavyweights are joining the campaign for same sex marriage in Australia. Telecom giant Telstra Qantas and PricewaterhouseCoopers have signed an open letter urging the conservative government to consider the economic benefits of reform.
They have been joined by the nation's biggest banks, ANZ, the Commonwealth and Westpac, along with retailer David Jones.
The letter states:  ""Not only is marriage equality the only truly fair option, but it's also a sound economic option given that a happy workforce is a productive one.
""To remain competitive, and to attract top talent from around the world, organisations - and nations - must create a fair and respectful environment for all.""
Alex Greenwich, an openly gay member of the New South Wales parliament and a former businessman, who ran a recruitment agency before entering politics, believes that employees who are happy and respected at work are more productive.
""There have been so many studies done on the importance of diversity within the workplace and the importance of accepting and treating your staff well in the workplace.
""It's kind of a no-brainer,"" says Mr Greenwich, who believes it is time for Australia to shed its reputation for sexual intolerance.
""We know that gay and lesbian people are out and open in very senior levels in a number of corporates across the world, and a lot of them are now saying why do we want to go to a country where we'll be treated as a second-class citizen?""
The importance of the so-called 'pink dollar' is felt around in the world where reform has been embraced.
But this has done little to soften those opposed to change, who argue that any alterations to Australia's marriage laws would be a backward step.
""I think it is disappointing when we have big business trying to influence governments, and for big business to use their clout in this way is intimidating,"" says Wendy Francis, the Queensland director for the Australian Christian Lobby.
""What is good for the economy is stable families and that is what we are really wanting to protect in Australia.""
Bills to allow gay Australians to marry have been rejected by parliamentarians in the past, and there is currently no legislative timetable for further debate in Canberra.
The conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbott has deep-seated religious objections, although opinion polls have suggested a majority of voters would be in favour of marriage equality.
While there is resistance at a federal level, laws now exist in New South Wales, Tasmania, Queensland, and Victoria, as well as the Australian Capital Territory that legally recognise same-sex unions.
Two years ago, New Zealand became the first country in the Asia-Pacific region to legalise same-sex marriages, and the architects of change believe it has had a transformative effect.
""All gay and lesbian people that I encounter are holding their heads just a wee bit higher because they know that the law no longer distinguishes between them and our heterosexual counterparts in this area at least,"" says Kevin Hague, a Green Party MP, who worked on marriage equality campaign.
""I know that popular wedding destinations like Queenstown and Rotorua have had a real boom time with same-sex couples from Australia coming over the get married here.""","In Australia, at least 18,000 same-sex couples are waiting for the law to change to allow them to get married, according to the University of Queensland.",32655943,"The campaign for marriage equality in Australia is gaining support from major corporations and high-profile individuals, with estimates suggesting that legalizing same-sex marriage could bring in around $600 million in spending and boost the country's economy, but conservative opposition remains strong.",0,"Article: {}

The ""Big Ben"" bell, after which the Palace of Westminster's Elizabeth Tower is more commonly known, is expected to fall silent early next year for the first time since 2007 for a three-year renovation project.
The work will cost £29m and involve repairs to the clock's hands, mechanism and pendulum.

""And then - here's the hard bit - you'd have to rush in again at midnight, because there are live bongs again before the midnight news.
""That's an awful lot of work for someone who is still quite young. I wouldn't like to do all that.""

Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Duncan Smith said: ""I think the work programme is now for the first time ever working with people, who were once on sickness benefits and who are now not, going back to work.""
He said the new regime would see disabled benefits claimants assessed on a regular basis to determine whether they need more support with their ailments or help to get work.
""There were over a million [people] not looked at for over 10 years,"" Mr Duncan Smith said.
""These regular reviews, I think, will help them and benefit them. We haven't introduced this to hurt or to harm disabled people. The purpose is to try to support disabled people.""
He added: ""The idea is to get people assessed so that we can find out those whose conditions have improved can then seek work, and many are going back to work now, and those who need full support get that full support.""
The government has been gradually rolling out the new Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to replace the Disability Living Allowance (DLA).
Under the old disability regime, claimants had to prove they could walk no further than 50m without support to receive the top end of the allowance.
Now, they will have to prove they can manage no more than 20m to benefit from the top payment.
Mr Duncan Smith insisted this was not a straight forward change, and that people would be assessed in two stages - on how much difficulty they have in reaching 20m first, and then 50m.
""What we're trying to do with these reforms is to get them to be fair so that the people who need them get better payments, and those who don't need the higher levels don't take the higher levels,"" Mr Duncan Smith said.
Under the DLA system, he said, 70% of people who made a claim got awards ""for life"".
The new regime will include regular face-to-face checks to establish the extent of claimants' ailments.
He said the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) expects almost half of the Â£50bn in savings to come in the next 12 months.
The raft of welfare reforms, introduced a year ago, also included what the government calls the removal of the ""spare room subsidy"" but critics call the ""bedroom tax"".
Mr Duncan Smith, defending it, said it was not a tax but rather a ""balanced and fair"" policy for taxpayers.
However, Sarah Clifford, director of communications for the Disabilities Trust, said the reforms were part of a ""triple whammy"" of factors affecting disabled people.
She said the changes needed to be seen alongside cutbacks by local authorities and changes to housing benefit in England, Scotland and Wales.
The housing benefits changes - dubbed the ""bedroom tax"" by critics but described by ministers as the removal of a ""spare room subsidy"" - were introduced in April last year.  A committee of MPs warned last week that the measures were creating ""financial hardship and distress"" for disabled people.
Ms Clifford said: ""We just hope Mr Duncan Smith can deliver on the promise that this will be a fair system and will not be unfair or unjust on people with disabilities.""
Meanwhile, the work and pensions secretary said the government had sought to end a contract with the firm Atos, which was tasked with assessing whether benefit claimants were fit to work.
Mr Duncan Smith denied reports it was Atos that had ended the arrangement, saying the taxpayer would pay nothing for the early break in the contract.","The work and pensions secretary has defended changes to the welfare system, including disability benefit reforms.",26909658,"The UK government has introduced a series of reforms to the welfare system, including changes to disability benefits, which are expected to save £50 billion by the end of the parliament, according to Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, who defended the reforms as fair and aimed at supporting disabled people to return to work.",0,"Article: {}

He was euthanised ""in his best interests"", the zoo said in a statement on Monday.
An Australian pelican, Lanky was the longest living resident of Wellington Zoo, arriving there in 1978.
""Lanky had regular medical examinations and we were able to manage the arthritis in his ankles with pain relief and anti-inflammatories, but his lameness increased over recent months,"" said the zoo.
His recent refusal to eat was in contrast to his appetite in better days, when he consumed a kilo of fish a day, sometimes ""sneaking food off his neighbours"" in his favourite haunt of Monkey Island, said Senior Keeper Phil Wisker.
Pelicans from Australia do occasionally drop into New Zealand but Lanky was the only one permanently in the country.
He originally arrived in Wellington from Australia's Adelaide Zoo, after being rescued with three other wild pelicans from a local drought, the zoo said.

England only needed a draw to finish top of the group and after a lacklustre first half, Nikita Parris set them on the way to victory after the break.
The striker headed home Karen Carney's cross to give England the lead.
England dominated thereafter and Carney doubled the visitors' advantage with a strike which took a heavy deflection.
Jade Moore won the ball and released Carney who neatly beat one defender on the edge of the box before scoring with a strike which went in via Lorca van de Putte.
It was a victory which extended England's unbeaten run to seven matches, with the past five of those ending in victories. The Lionesses last lost a competitive qualifier in November 2002.
England had already qualified for next summer's tournament in the Netherlands thanks to the 5-0 thumping of Estonia on 15 September, but England boss Mark Sampson said before the match in Leuven that he was determined his team would end the qualifiers as group leaders.
Belgium, the only team to have taken a point off Sampson's side during the campaign, could have finished top of Group 7 had they beaten England, but they never truly came close and must settle for second spot.
Neither team impressed in a first half full of stray passes and pedestrian attacks. England's best chance fell to Lucy Bronze, whose long-range effort was a fraction wide from the top corner.
Belgium also had an opportunity to break the deadlock and would probably have scored through a Tessa Wullaert in-swinging corner had Jill Scott not headed the danger away.
Belgium were organised in defence and for most of the match were quick to close down playmaker Karen Carney whenever she received the ball, reducing her influence in the final third and consequently nullifying England.
But on the rare occasions Belgium did give Carney space to pull England's strings, the Chelsea forward was ruthless. First, she floated a lovely cross towards the industrious Parris to score her third international goal and followed up with five minutes remaining with a strike which completely wrong-footed Justien Odeurs thanks to the deflection.
Sampson has proved he is not afraid to make changes - tweaking the formation during this campaign and making two changes to the team which beat Estonia, with Siobhan Chamberlain and Gemma Davison replaced by Karen Bardsley and Gilly Flaherty.
But it was the introduction of Moore that changed the course of this match, with the midfielder breaking up play and giving the visitors more ballast in midfield.

475,477,"The boy had lived with the twin in his stomach his whole life, but went to hospital after complaining of pain.
His mother told Bernama the foetus ""was formed with organs like those of a baby"".
It is believed to be the first reported case of the condition, known medically as ""fetus in fetu"", in Malaysia.
The boy's mother, 38, said funeral rites had been performed on the foetus and it was buried at a local cemetery.
Reports said the foetus had legs, hands and genitals.
""Only the nose and mouth were not complete,"" she said, saying she had accepted his fate.
The teenager had been admitted to a local district hospital before being referred to the Sultan Abdul Hamid Hospital in Kedah for the operation to remove the twin.
The hospital and Malaysia's government health officials would not comment on the case to the BBC.
What is fetus in fetu?
Dr S Raman, obstetrics and gynaecology specialist at Pantai Hospital in the capital, Kuala Lumpur, told the BBC it is when an ""additional twin gets absorbed into the body of the living twin"".
""It's almost like a vanishing twin, or sometimes called a parasitic twin,"" he said.
""I have actually seen a case of the foetus being attached to the outside of the living twin, so it's possible for the twin to be both inside or outside the body.""
There have also been cases of two twins found inside the abdomen of one child, in the case of a triplet pregnancy.
What causes it?
There is no known trigger, but it occurs in the early stages of development when one foetus wraps around the other.
The enveloped twin then does not fully form but becomes a ""parasite"", relying on their host twin for their survival. Such twins usually die before birth.
The abnormality is estimated to occur in 1 in 500,000 live births.
Is it unusual to live so long with the twin?
One widely reported case was of a 36-year-old man in India whose tumour had grown so big that he was having difficulty breathing.
In villages or smaller towns where access to medical facilities are limited, it is possible for someone to not know they have a foetus and live with it their entire life, says Dr Raman.
The abnormality is easily spotted if a baby undergoes an ultrasound or CT scan, and there have been cases of babies as young as three months old being operated on.","A 15-year-old Malaysian boy has had the parasitic foetus of his twin removed from his stomach, Malaysia's Bernama state news agency reports.",36376079,"A teenage boy in Malaysia was born with a parasitic twin inside his abdomen, which had developed in the early stages of his development and had been living inside him for his entire life, causing him pain and leading to his eventual hospitalization and surgical removal.",0,"Article: {}

486,488,"It would mean some schools being taken from council control and being converted to academies.
There are four investigations examining ""Trojan Horse"" claims that groups of hardline Muslims have been trying to take over schools in the city.
A government source says that no options have been ruled in or out.
The trust which runs Park View, one of the schools caught up in the claims, issued a statement on Thursday dismissing allegations of extremism as false.
The education watchdog Ofsted and the Department for Education are expected to deliver reports in June on the next steps for schools which have faced these allegations.
It is understood that ministers have approached heads of successful schools and academy trusts about taking over other schools where there have been concerns.
This could include taking schools away from local authority control, converting them into academies - directly funded by central government - and putting them under the leadership of high-achieving head teachers.
Groups of outstanding schools like the Perry Beeches chain in Birmingham may have a role.
As some of the schools caught up in the Trojan Horse claims are already academies, it could mean schools being reassigned to other academy trusts.
Birmingham City Council said it would not be appropriate to comment on any ""proposed action"" until Ofsted's inspection reports had been published.
""We can say, however, that we are in regular contact with DfE and this action has not been discussed with us,"" said a council spokesperson.
The GMB union warned: ""It is absolutely disgusting that the government is pre-empting the outcome of the investigation into these schools and planning to sell these schools on to their friends in the academy chains.""
Before the Trojan Horse claims, Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw had spoken publicly of his belief that the local authority might need to be broken up.
Birmingham is the biggest local authority in England - and it is believed that private soundings have shown it would be difficult to find a private sector contractor willing or able to take on the running of such a wide range of services.
But another option would be for some or all of the council's education and children's services to be hived off to an independent trust.
This model has been used before where central government believed there was a need for radical intervention - such as in Hackney in London.
Birmingham City Council's chief executive, Mark Rogers, was recorded at a meeting with school representatives last week, where he warned of a ""firestorm"" when the Ofsted reports were published, and telling his audience to prepare for ""significant structural changes"" within the education department.
The investigations into extremism in Birmingham schools had been sparked by an anonymous and unverified letter claiming that there was a ""Trojan Horse"" conspiracy by a group wanting to impose a more hardline Muslim agenda on schools in the city.
This included claims that head teachers were being replaced with staff who were more likely to be sympathetic to these religious beliefs.
The authenticity of the letter has been disputed, but the National Association of Head Teachers says there seem to have been ""concerted efforts"" to take over six schools in Birmingham.
However, claims of extremism have been categorically denied by Tahir Alam, chairman of governors at Park View School.
And the Park View Educational Trust issued a statement arguing that the response to the letter had created a climate which encouraged false allegations.
The claims about religious extremism were driven by ""the settling of political scores"" and disgruntled former staff, the trust argues.
""Our assemblies, or acts of worship, are used to focus on the spiritual and moral development of pupils and are relevant to their school and home lives,"" said the statement from Park View.
""This includes looking at the common values of kindness, mercy and forgiveness and talking to students about studying hard, and being a good friend.""","Super-heads could take over running clusters of schools in Birmingham, as the government considers its response to allegations of extremism.",27429977,"The UK government is considering taking control of some schools in Birmingham, England, away from the local council and giving them to successful academy trusts, as part of an investigation into ""Trojan Horse"" claims of extremist Muslim takeovers of schools, with some schools already being converted to academies and heads of high-achieving schools being approached about taking over other schools.",0,"Article: {}

""It is therefore of concern that the skipper and two crew were tragically found unresponsive and face down in their lifejackets when the rescue services arrived on scene.
""The results of lifejacket trials undertaken by the MAIB and of lifejacket testing commissioned by the MCA following the accident strengthen that concern.
""Therefore, as a matter of urgency, I am recommending the MCA to conduct further research to confirm or otherwise the suitability of historical and extant lifejacket water performance test protocols.""
The Louisa had been anchored close to shore in Mingulay Bay.
The skipper and crew, who had been working long hours before anchoring late the previous evening, were asleep onboard, said the MAIB.
Investigators believe the boat's deck wash hose flooded the hold and the crew were woken by the Louisa ""sinking rapidly"".
The four men escaped to the aft deck, activated the boat's emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) and put on lifejackets.
However, they were unable to inflate the liferaft as they abandoned the vessel.
Louisa's EPIRB was detected and the coastguard was alerted.
But the MAIB said ""confusion over terminology resulted in delays before search and rescue units were sent to the scene"".
The investigation of the incident involved raising the wreck of the crab boat and taking it to Clydebank.
A spokeswoman for the MCA said: ""This is a deeply tragic incident and our thoughts remain with the families of these fishermen, who've suffered a terrible loss.
""Saving lives at sea is our highest priority, and we strive to ensure that our search and rescue techniques are  continually reviewed in order to deliver an effective and efficient emergency response.""
She added: ""The MCA is continuing to collaborate with the MAIB on the contents of this report in order to address the recommendations put forward.""
A spokesman for Louisa fishing vessel owners, Duncan and Murdo Kennedy, said: ""The tragic events of 9 April 2016 resulted in the loss of three fine fisherman and our thoughts remain with the families of Martin Johnstone, Chris Morrison, Paul Alliston and surviving crew member, Lachlan Armstrong.
""We have fully cooperated with the MAIB inquiry and are committed to implementing the report's recommendations. We hope the wider issues raised in the report will lead to improved safety for all those working at sea and prevent any similar incident from happening.""",An urgent review of how lifejackets are tested has been recommended following the deaths of the skipper and two crew of a crab boat that sank last year.,40730264,"An investigation into the sinking of the Louisa crab fishing boat off the coast of Scotland found that the lifejackets worn by the crew did not function properly, leading to the deaths of three crew members and one missing, and recommended an urgent review of lifejacket testing protocols by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.",0,"Article: {}

The Sunni jihadist group, Islamic State (IS), said it was behind the bombing and that it targeted Shia militiamen.
Meanwhile, medics say more than 20 civilians died when bombs dropped by the Iraqi air force hit a maternity and children's hospital in Falluja.
The city lies west of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since January 2014.
The violence comes after a top American general said the US should consider embedding American troops with Iraqi forces if progress was not made in the fight against IS.
Raymond Odierno, the army's outgoing chief of staff, told reporters that such forces would have a support rather than a combat role.
Thursday's bomb attack in Sadr City was one of the deadliest in the capital since Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi took office a year ago.
In a statement posted on Twitter, IS said the truck bomb targeted Shia militiamen from the Mahdi Army and the Popular Mobilisation forces, who have been battling the jihadist group in northern and western Iraq for more than a year.
Sadr City has been the target of several bomb attacks this year claimed by IS militants, who consider Shia to be heretics.
Dozens of people have been killed in bombings across Baghdad in recent months. In May and July, large car bombs exploded outside two prominent hotels.
IS also continues to control vast swathes of territory in northern and western Iraq, but air strikes by a US-led coalition have helped Iraqi pro-government forces regain some territory since last August.

Global markets have tumbled this week, with investors disconcerted at the lack of growth in Europe and especially Greece, the impact of Ebola, and worrying economic data from China and the US.

498,500,"They have trained wild monitor lizards, known locally as goannas, not to eat the toxic amphibians.
They did this by feeding the reptiles small, less potent cane toads. Many that tried the toads once did not make the same mistake again.
The researchers say that extending the trial could help the continent's wildlife.
The study is published in the Royal Society journal, Biology Letters.
Lead researcher Georgia Ward-Fear, from the University of Sydney, said: ""We've been very surprised by the results, by the amount of time that some of these lizards have actually retained this knowledge and survived in the presence of a high-density of cane toads, which is basically unheard of in the wild.""
Cane toads were introduced to Australia in the 1930s to control sugar cane pests.
But the subsequent spread has been unstoppable, devastating the continent's animals.
Among the hardest hit are the yellow-spotted monitors (Varanus panoptes).   Their population is estimated to have plummeted by 90%.
When the toads invade a new area, these yellow-and-black-spotted reptiles feast on the amphibians, and subsequently die.
""A goanna only has to mouth a toad for less than 30 seconds and it can kill them,"" said Dr Ward-Fear.
""This species is quite abundant in ecosystems ahead of a cane toad invasion, and then as we see the invasion move through, they are basically wiped out of the landscape.""
In the trials, the researchers tracked down wild lizards before the toads descended.
Dr Ward-Fear explained: ""We presented them with a small toad via our very technical apparatus: a telescopic fishing pole. The toad had a little cotton belt attached to it.
""We sidled up to the goanna in a very stealthy manner and extended the fishing pole.""
The young toads made the lizards sick, but were not toxic enough to do lasting harm.
The scientists then attached radio transmitters to follow the goannas as the amphibians arrived in the area.
Many of the 16 lizards who'd already tasted toad did not make the same mistake again - and more than half survived during the 18-month study period.
The team also followed 31 ""untrained"" lizards that had not eaten the toads.
""We saw the goannas that had not had a negative experience with the small toad died very quickly. They all died within three months of the natural cane toad invasion arriving at the site. At the end of the study, every untrained goanna had died.""
The scientists say the study suggests goannas have the ability to learn from experience and retain that knowledge over a long period of time.
Dr Ward-Fear said: ""This study provides the proof of principle that this strategy could be very effective. Employing it in the wild could potentially have a really large positive impact on the goanna population.""

Analysts say the revision may be enough to mean the overall economy narrowly avoided falling into recession for a second time.
The ONS is due to give official confirmation of this in June.
The revised figures show the construction sector shrank by 5% in the first three months of 2012, less than the 5.4% contraction initially reported.
The ONS gives its final estimates for growth in June, and if other parts of the economy remain unchanged, the economy as a whole would register zero growth, rather than a contraction of 0.1%.

However, the ONS may also revise the growth of other parts of the economy when it publishes its final estimates in June, such as the much larger services sector, which may offset the gains in construction.
Construction accounts for less than 7% of the UK economy, whereas the services sector makes up about three quarters of output.

But this is not even the beginning of the end. Waiting in the wings, are around 800 additional potential claimants, perhaps more. News International seems to be in for a very long and very costly act of surrender.
Speaking outside the High Court, Mr Coogan said he had taken the action to expose the way in which parts of the press had been operating.
""Like other people who sued, I was determined to do my part to show the depths to which the press can sink in pursuit of private information.
""The police and the Leveson Inquiry will be investigating these matters but at the time, when these civil cases began, News International seemed likely to succeed in covering up the hacking scandal completely.
""Neither the police nor the government were willing to hold those responsible accountable for unlawful acts.""
He said some of the phone hacking victims were ""many ordinary members of the public, sometimes vulnerable people with the most tenuous connection to news"".
Mr Campbell said he would be using the settlement to make donations to organisations, including the Labour Party and Mind, ""so that at least some small good for the causes I believe in can come out of the criminality and cultural depravity of others"".
""For me, this has been about people with a voice and a platform using them to change the media culture which, as I argued at the Leveson Inquiry, has become putrid in parts,"" he said.
The announcement of the latest settlements, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews.
Mr Campbell said his settlement was a ""satisfactory outcome"" and NGN had agreed to search for other documents and that he may be entitled to further damages.
Details of the effect hacking had on Mr Gascoigne were given in a statement from his solicitor.
The judge was told the former England international footballer, who also played for Newcastle United and Tottenham Hotspur, had been the subject of a number of News of the World articles over many years and had ""considerable concerns"" about the source of some of the ""intrusive and private"" information.
The statement said: ""Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being obtained by bugging or tapping his telephone conversations, as a result of which he was accused of being paranoid.
""In addition, Mr Gascoigne was worried that the information was being given to the News of the World by his friends or family, as a result of which he fell out with several of his friends and family.""
The statement said the ex-footballer apologised for wrongly accusing those close to him of leaking information.
Those receiving settlements include:
Liberal Democrat deputy leader Mr Hughes said the practice of hacking was ""criminal behaviour on an industrial scale.""
He added: ""We must now make sure that nothing like this can ever happen again.""
These latest developments mean 15 more phone hacking cases have now been settled, including nine of the 10 which were due to go to civil trial on Monday. There were 37 other claims settled with NGN last month.
The announcement, at a hearing in London, came during the latest in a number of pre-trial reviews.
Another five phone-hacking cases are still due to be heard.
Those are of model Elle Macpherson's former adviser Mary Ellen Field, footballer Ryan Giggs, former royal butler Paul Burrell, police officer Jacqui Hames and her husband David Cook, and PR consultant Nicola Phillips.","Comedian Steve Coogan and ex-footballer Paul Gascoigne are among the latest people to have settled claims for damages over phone-hacking, the High Court has heard.",16946105,"The latest round of settlements in the phone hacking scandal has seen 15 more cases settled, including those of ex-Labour press chief Alastair Campbell and MP Simon Hughes, with substantial damages and costs awarded, as News International continues to wave the white flag in the civil cases for breach of privacy.",1,"Article: {}

507,509,"John Guidetti drove home the free-kick that followed Pascali's professional foul on Stefan Scepovic.
Kilmarnock keeper Conor Brennan limited the damage with a string of saves for the Ayrshire side.
But he could not prevent Scepovic knocking in a second after the break.
Media playback is not supported on this device
Pascali's dismissal changed the nature of the match. Before his red card on 34 minutes for pulling Scepovic back as he bore down on goal, the teams had been evenly matched.
Both sides had shown flashes of skill - a Guidetti flick here, an Alexei Eremenko dummy there - but the goalkeepers had been under-employed.
Tope Obadeyi advanced from midfield to offer some threat to Craig Gordon's goal on occasion but was stymied by the alertness of the Scotland keeper or the positioning of Virgil van Dijk and Jason Denayer in the home defence.
Van Dijk headed a corner a fraction wide and Celtic captain Scott Brown broke off from his midfield tussles with Jamie Hamill and Sammy Clingan to fire a few shots at Brennan's goal but they were bravely blocked by defenders.
And Mubarak Wakaso thumped a header straight into Brennan's arms from the corner of the six-yard box.
Gordon's only real save of the first half was to parry a 25-yard pile-driver by Eremenko.
Pascali, who had been the key figure in organising the Killie defence, was lucky when referee Willie Collum awarded him rather than Guidetti a free-kick after making a mess of ushering the ball out for a goal kick with the Swede snapping at his heels.
But the Italian offered little complaint when Collum flashed him a straight red for his panicked challenge on Scepovic.
Killie boss Allan Johnston immediately withdrew Eremenko and sent on Lee Ashcroft to partner Mark Connolly in defence but within seconds Guidetti had stroked his free-kick past the despairing Brennan.
Celtic had Killie on the back foot and the visitors had a close shave when Connolly headed an effort off the line and Brennan saved well from a Stefan Johansen crack from 18 yards.
As the Rugby Park men struggled to play in Celtic's half, so the chances came for the hosts.
Brennan palmed away an angled shot by Scepovic, relied on his post to keep out a Guidetti effort from 12 yards and was well placed, again, to block the centre-forward's effort 10 seconds later.
But the Serbia international would get the last laugh over Brennan, who was in for the injured Craig Samson.
Moments after side-footing horribly wide from 18 yards as Wakaso found space on the left, Scepovic was rewarded for his persistence when he met the winger's cross to hit the ball across Brennan and into the net.
Celtic manager Ronny Deila replaced the scorer with Leigh Griffiths and sent on Charlie Mulgrew for Johansen - but the match was over as a meaningful contest and Celtic were able to follow up Thursday's Europa League win over Astra by moving up to fourth in the Scottish Premiership, overtaking Kilmarnock in the process.

508,510,"HS2 Ltd, the company behind the rail link from London to northern England, last week said the redevelopment of the station would finish in 2033 - seven years later than planned.
Sir Keir Starmer, MP for Holborn and St Pancras, said those living nearby faced ""decades of blight"" from construction.
But the HS2 minister said the area would benefit from the redevelopment.
The first phase of HS2 will be between London and Birmingham and will be followed by a V-shaped section to Manchester and Leeds.
Euston is set to gain six new platforms and an additional concourse.
In a change to plans submitted two years ago, HS2 Ltd has proposed that the construction of five further platforms within the existing station should be delayed.
They would be ready for phase two of HS2 which will run from the capital to Leeds and Manchester in 2033.
HS2 Ltd said the changes meant the construction would be less intense.
But speaking to the Commons on Tuesday, Sir Keir rejected that: ""We have had plans, amended plans and further amended plans for Euston.
""The only sensible plan is to abandon the project altogether.
""This plan, far from being an improvement on the other plans, is the worst of the lot and leaves my constituents with all of the pain and none of the gain.
""And I focus here particularly on the phased approach - it offers and sets up decades of blight with no assurance about when the project as a whole will be finished.""
HS2 Minister Robert Goodwill said Euston needed to experience the same regeneration as King's Cross-St Pancras, also in north London.
He said: ""Our Euston proposal is fully compatible with the redevelopment of the remaining Network Rail station and our proposals have been developed with Network Rail and (Transport for London).""
Replying to Sir Keir, Mr Goodwill said disruption for commuters also needed to be considered alongside disruption faced by residents.
He said reports suggesting there would be reductions in platform space were ""not correct"".
Mr Goodwill also said Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin was ""very keen to see the resurrection of the Euston Arch"".
Euston Arch, which was built in the 1830s, stood at the front of the station until it was demolished in 1962 when the station was rebuilt.
He said: ""We think we know where the bits are, and indeed the Euston Arch Trust aims to reform the arch and it's for them to bring this forward through a local planning application, but we have a location in the new Euston Square Gardens for the arch to come forward.""","Plans to redevelop London Euston as part of the high-speed railway line HS2 should be scrapped, an MP has said.",34264322,"Sure!

510,512,"No-one here is in any doubt that Boko Haram did it.
It seems people do not know where to vent their anger now but hostility hangs in the air.
Inside the mosque, the sight is shocking.
Beyond the blood-soaked steps, the floor is strewn with debris: scattered prayer mats, beads, smashed spectacles and pages from the Koran.
There are bullet marks on the pillars and the suicide bombers' blood can be seen splattered across the walls and right up inside the dome.
""We heard a loud sound outside, but people said let's continue praying,"" said Adamu Magashi, who was inside facing the imam who had just finished his sermon at the time of the attack.
""Then a bomb went off right inside the mosque and somebody started shooting. We tried to move towards the imam and there was another blast - we couldn't even see each other as we tried to escape,"" he told me after returning to the scene.
Outside, a large crowd stands over the twisted remains of the motorbikes and bicycles that were engulfed in the flames when the first bomber struck, driving a car into the assembled worshippers.
Policemen occasionally disperse the agitated throng.
Another crowd stares at a collection of blackened shoes that has been gathered up in the large open sandy area in front of the green domed mosque.
""This was the first time ever the five daily prayers were not observed in this mosque,"" one shocked man, who has often prayed here, told me, describing the attack as unimaginable.
On Friday, the terror swiftly turned to fury when three of the gunmen were overpowered right outside the mosque. They were beaten and burnt to death.
Had their lives been spared, they could have provided useful intelligence on the group behind the violence - not that the police have a good record of investigating and prosecuting. Boko Haram's former leader Mohammed Yusuf was killed when in police custody in 2009.
At one of the hospitals, where the hundreds of injured are being treated, the police had to intervene to stop a mob lynching a man who had somehow caused fury by taking a photograph.
By targeting such a prominent place of worship, the jihadists have sent shockwaves right across Nigeria.
This was not just another attack - Boko Haram seemed to be stating it had no respect for the way Islam is practised here.
The people of Kano have been shocked and traumatised before by bombers and gunmen working in tandem.
This was by no means the first Boko Haram attack on a mosque.
But it was possibly the most devastating.
And whilst some have portrayed the Boko Haram insurgency as a war on Christianity, this attack is yet another stark reminder that the vast majority of victims in the conflict have been Muslims.
Back in April 2007, a high-profile Muslim cleric was killed in Kano.  Sheikh Ja'afar Mahmoud Adam, was gunned down as he prayed at a mosque here after criticising the group's hardline ideology.
Seven years on and the list of targets has grown to include policemen, soldiers, government workers, schoolchildren, teachers, vigilantes, entire barracks as well as towns and villages that have recently been captured by the Islamist insurgents.
Anyone who does not subscribe to Boko Haram's own interpretation of Islam is a potential victim.
The mosque is situated right next to the emir of Kano's palace and is where the outspoken Mohammed Sanusi II regularly preaches.
Some people suggest it is no coincidence that the jihadists chose this mosque.
Just last week, in the very same building, the emir warned people not to rely on protection by the military, urging them to defend themselves against attacks by the insurgents.
""If people flee the villages, the terrorists slaughter our male children and abduct our girls to force them in to slavery,"" he said.
He was out of the country when the gunmen and bombers struck, but he returned on Saturday, visited the mosque twice and sounded defiant.
""We will never be intimidated into abandoning our religion, which is the intention of the attackers,"" he said. He later lead evening prayers at the bloody scene.
As trucks take away the debris, people are now cleaning up the mosque ready to pray again.
But the jihadist attacks are so relentless that no-one knows where they will strike next.
In the 10 days prior to the Kano attack, 188 people were killed by Boko Haram in four separate attacks.  And those are just the incidents we heard about.
The loss of life here is on a staggering scale, but the politicians hardly mention it.

Results of the review show nine of her allegations were entirely upheld and one partially.

Up until now, the results of the investigation - carried out a year ago - went unpublished.
But parts of the report were released under a Freedom of Information request.
Ms Clwyd told BBC Wales the report summary should not have been made public, especially while another investigation is under way. She disputed there was insufficient evidence for her claims, and said she had additional evidence.
She said: ""I think that when the other investigation is concluded then my views will be substantially vindicated.""
By Tomos LivingstoneBBC Wales political correspondent
This case has led to a huge political row.
We ended up with the extraordinary situation of a Labour MP, Ann Clwyd, being criticised by the Labour First Minister, Carwyn Jones, for failing, in his view, to provide evidence to back up her claims.
At the same time, we recently had the Welsh Conservative Party conference in Llangollen and delegates there standing and applauding Ann Clwyd for the work she had done campaigning for better standards of care in the health service.
There is a general election of course coming up next year - health care standards are already a central part of that campaign, not least perceived differences in standards between Wales and England.
So we are going to hear a lot more about the political row this case has caused and we are going to hear a lot more about the individual case itself, I think, with a second investigation now on its way.
The health board has denied breaching confidentiality and said the details released were statements already in the public domain.
A health board spokesman said: ""We would like to make quite clear that the health board has not released the full report and it is not our intention to breach any confidentiality.
""The investigation into Ms Clywd's concerns was overseen by an expert independent panel and completed in April 2013. Since then the health board has received a number of requests under Freedom of Information legislation to release that report. As part of that standard process Ms Clwyd's permission was sought to release the full report but that was refused.""
The spokesman said it sought legal advice before releasing the summary.
He said: ""Based on that advice the health board believes it would be in breach of its statutory duty not to release the summary report.""
The release of the report summary follows a dispute between Ms Clwyd and the Labour Welsh government.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has told Assembly Members the MP provided ""unattributable"" comments about the NHS that ""can't be investigated"".
But Ms Clwyd insisted she had provided Mr Jones with a comprehensive summary of complaints raised.

513,515,"The charred pine twigs date back 140 million years to a time when fires raged across large tracts of land.
Pine trees now dominate the forests of the Northern Hemisphere.
The research suggests the tree's evolution was shaped in the fiery landscape of the Cretaceous, where oxygen levels were much higher than today, fuelling intense and frequent wildfires.
""Pines are well adapted to fire today,"" said Dr Howard Falcon-Lang of Royal Holloway, University of London, who discovered the fossils in Nova Scotia, Canada.
""The fossils show that wildfires raged through the earliest pine forests and probably shaped the evolution of this important tree.""
The specimens, which are described in Geology journal, were preserved as charcoal within rocks from a quarry.
""It was only when I digested [the samples] in acid that these beautiful fossils fell out,"" Dr Falcon-Lang told BBC News.
""They were sitting in my cupboard for five years before I actually worked out what was there.""
The fossils are just a few mm long but probably came from trees resembling the Scots Pine that now cover large areas of Scotland.
Pines are well adapted to fire, containing inflammable deadwood that makes them burn easily.
They also produce cones that will only germinate after being scorched, ensuring a new generation of trees is seeded after the fire has passed by and other vegetation has been destroyed.
Scientists have debated for many years why some trees seem to thrive on wildfires.
""One of the oddities about pine trees today is that they are one of the most fire adapted species on our planet,"" explained Dr Falcon-Lang.
""These oldest pine fossils are preserved as charcoal, the product of fire, suggesting that the co-occurrence of fire and pines is something that's very ancient, that goes back to the very origin of these first pine trees.""
Dr Falcon-Lang plans to return to the quarry this summer to recover more specimens.
He hopes to find fossils of flowering plants, which were evolving at the same time as the ancient pines.

Cardiff Blues face the Ospreys at the Principality Stadium on Saturday before the Newport Gwent Dragons play the Scarlets in the double header with Gatland naming his Lions squad on 19 April.
""I can only speculate in regards to the selection on the 19th [of April] for the Lions,"" said McBryde.
""We are just expecting there to be a few players from the teams that are playing this weekend to be selected.
""But we are just looking forward to seeing how they react to playing at the Principality and looking forward to the good occasion.
""There were some quite consistent performances during the Six Nations, so there could be as many as 9/10 Welsh players selected for the Lions tour.""

McBryde says he will be picking a squad to win both Tests when he names the Wales touring party for the summer of 24 April, and that Judgement Day could also have ramifications for the Wales squad.
""We have always said that we would measure the players by their performances in the Pro12, their performances against one another in the derbies and in Europe, especially against the Irish provinces."" he told BBC Wales Sport.
""But this game is a big one from a selection point of view. We are looking to name the squad on the 24th to allow the players to prepare both physical and mentally prepare for the tour ahead. So the double-header does allow us to focus on the players with a close microscope.

516,518,"The Welsh government said Jobs Growth Wales had not been scrapped and placements would continue.
Last year, the scheme's budget was cut in order for cash to go to the NHS.
But the Labour-run Welsh government said this had not affected the scheme which had hit all its targets. Criticism has followed the closure.
Chancellor George Osborne from the Conservative party, said the decision to temporarily close the scheme pointed to ""confusion"" within labour after party leader Ed Miliband had said he wanted the programme to be rolled out across the country.
Campaigning in the Vale of Glamorgan, Mr Osborne said: ""I remember the Labour party urging me to take this scheme across the whole of the UK.  Now they are cutting it in Wales.
""What it points to is real confusion in the Labour party. They don't really have a clear plan for Wales and I think Wales as a result would suffer with lost jobs, lost investment.""
Other parties also criticised the decision with Jenny Willott, for the Liberal Democrats, saying Jobs Growth Wales had been ""ineffective"".
""However, for the Welsh Labour Government to allow this scheme to expire without replacing it is staggering,"" she said.
And Ian Johnson, a Plaid Cymru election candidate, added: ""Earlier this year, Ed Miliband said how great the scheme was.
""Today, he has been embarrassed by his only government in the UK, who have fundamentally undermined his election pledge to young people.""
Meanwhile, UKIP's leader in Wales Nathan Gill called on ministers to ""focus on creating the right conditions for existing businesses to expand and for new businesses to start"".
""The only way we will ever truly achieve this is to withdraw from the European Union, which spends each day dreaming up new ways of stifling innovation and creativity in the form of regulations and directives,"" he said.
But the Welsh government said it was aiming to launch a new Jobs Growth Wales programme in May saying it has made a ""significant contribution to reducing youth unemployment right across Wales"".
""The original programme was designed to create and fill 12,000 jobs and to date it has helped create over 17,000 job opportunities and fill almost 15,000 of these vacancies for young people aged 16-24,"" a spokesperson said.
""The European Social Fund budget for the 2007-2013 programme came to an end on 31 March and we have already begun work on the successor programme.
""Subject to approval within the new European Social Fund for 2014-2020 we are aiming to launch the new Jobs Growth Wales programme in the first quarter of this financial year.""
The thrust of the criticism here is that if Jobs Growth Wales is so important to the Welsh economy then how come it has been allowed to come to a halt, albeit temporarily, and how come funding has been reduced?
The opposition parties have seized on developments partly because barely a week goes by without a member of the Welsh government trumpeting the success of its back-to-work scheme.
The Welsh government insists it is not being scrapped and has responded to criticism over continuity by pointing to the fact that anyone about to begin or in the middle of a six-month placement will not be affected.

519,521,"A deal was made by the two main parties and the British and Irish governments to resolve a crisis at Stormont.
Solutions were found on issues over paramilitarism and welfare reform.
But Deputy Chief Constable Drew Harris said a lack of consensus over how to deal with the past was a let-down to police and Troubles victims' families.
DCC Harris said an extra Â£160m of government funding to tackle dissident republicans that was agreed in the deal was much needed.
He added the agreement's initiatives to tackle paramilitarism and organised crime were also positive.
But a proposed new independent Historical Investigations Unit, which would have taken on the Police Service of Northern Ireland's (PSNI) responsibility for outstanding Troubles murder investigations, has not yet been approved.
DCC Harris said: ""We are on record as saying the formation of a Historical Investigations Unit would provide an opportunity for a more structured and coherent approach to dealing with the past, allowing the PSNI to concentrate primarily on keeping people safe today.""
He said that in absence of that body the PSNI would have to ensure its ""finite resources are used in the most effective manner"".
""We must balance keeping people safe today with our continued duties in relation to the past.
""The reality is the financial challenges facing us will continue to have a direct impact on how we respond to the demands of the past and the pace at which those demands can be serviced.""
Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness said talks on the legacy of the past failed because the government would not commit to full disclosure of classified documents relating to Troubles incidents on national security grounds.
He added: ""That pretext for blocking disclosure is clearly nonsense as much of the information families are looking for is related to events 30 to 40 years ago.""
Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers, who helped broker the agreement, is to meet relatives of Troubles victims to discuss their concerns over the deal.
It had been a ""bitter pill for victims to swallow"", according the the victims' commissioner Judith Thompson.
She said victims ""deserve respect and consideration and they cannot be shunted off into a dead end"".
""It is not good enough to build up hopes for the most comprehensive set of proposals yet to address victims' and survivors' needs and then fail to deliver.""
Ms Thompson added that politicians must give a timescale for ""the issues that are being put in the 'too difficult' box once again"".
Alan McBride, whose wife was killed in the IRA's 1993 bombing of a fishmonger's on Belfast's Shankill Road, said he was uncertain whether legacy issues would ever be resolved.
""My frustration is that they're not going to be able to agree on this, so therefore there's going to be another opportunity wasted,"" he said.
""There is talking still on going, and that has got to be welcomed, because we have to give out hope to victims and survivors.""
Mike Ritchie, a case work manager for the Relatives for Justice victims' group, said that while he was disappointed with the outcome of the political negotiations, he would prefer no deal to ""a bad deal"".
""To set up a bad process again would be very difficult for victims' families,"" Mr Ritchie said.
""If we're going to have a deal let's have a good deal.""

Dong Nguyen, who created the game in just two to three days, was making as much as $50,000 (Â£30,482) a day from the game's advertising revenue.
In several Twitter posts, he said the game's removal was not due to legal issues and that he may make a sequel.
Mr Dong, who describes himself as a ""passionate indie game maker"", also said on the micro-blogging site that he will not sell Flappy Bird but that he will still make games.
Flappy Bird has been downloaded more than 50 million times, making it this year's most popular mobile game so far.
Launched in May 2013, the game was free to download and required players to tap the screen to keep the bird in flight.
Despite its simple graphics, Flappy Bird was a notoriously difficult game since many users could only keep the bird in the air for a few seconds before it hits an obstacle and falls.
The game went viral after being promoted almost entirely by social media users and was reviewed on a YouTube channel by more than 22 million subscribers.
The official version was only available for Apple and Android devices. It quickly became the number one free game in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store charts.
Several news sites had noted the similarity between the game and an earlier title called Piou Piou, by a different French developer, as well as the fact that Flappy Bird's main character and obstacles resembled the Cheep-Cheep birds and green pipes found in Nintendo's Super Mario Bros series.
Forbes had even suggested that Mr Dong could be sued for intellectual property infringement as a result. However, the developer has stated that his decision to pull the title was ""not anything related to legal issues"".
After Mr Dong took the game down, many fans turned to social media to petition for its return.
On Twitter, there were widely-used hashtags of #RIPFlappyBird and #SaveFlappyBird, with several ""Save Flappy Bird"" accounts being spawned as well.
The game is no longer available through online stores, but it still works on phones that had previously downloaded it.
As a result, some online users have offered to sell their smartphones still containing the Flappy Birds app for large sums of money.

528,530,"By law, he must stand down as president in 2013, having completed two consecutive terms as president of the former Soviet republic.
However, his years in office have marked Georgia for years to come.
To some he will always be the hero of the Rose Revolution, sweeping away Soviet-style corruption and courting the West.
To others, he is the leader who rashly sparked a dangerous war with Russia.
Mr Saakashvili's background has all the ingredients of a successful career on the international stage and helps explain his appeal to Brussels and Washington.
Born in 1967 in the Georgian capital Tbilisi to a doctor father and a historian mother, he did his Soviet military service in Ukraine, where he went on to study international law.
Receiving a fellowship from the US state department, he attended Columbia University law school and was hired by a New York-based law firm.
In addition to his native Georgian, he speaks English, French, Ukrainian and Russian.
He and his Dutch wife, human rights specialist Sandra Elisabeth Roelofs, have two sons.
Returning to Georgia from his career abroad, he was appointed justice minister in October 2000 by the then President, Eduard Shevardnadze.
But he resigned the following year, saying he considered it immoral to remain a member of a government plagued by corruption and cronyism.
After forming an opposition party, the National Movement, he was elected head of Tbilisi city council where he built up a power base.
Discontent with Mr Shevardnadze grew steadily and when parliamentary elections in November 2003 were tainted by allegations of fraud, Mr Saakashvili organised daily protests.
The Rose Revolution culminated in the bloodless storming of the Georgian parliament and Mr Shevardnadze's resignation. In January 2004, Mr Saakashvili was elected president of his country with 96% of the vote, at the tender age of 37.
""I'm not pro-American or pro-Russian - I am pro-Georgian,"" the new president said in his inaugural speech.
However, it rapidly became clear that he meant to take Georgia out of Moscow's orbit, by joining Nato no less.
Relations between Georgia and its giant neighbour rapidly deteriorated, as Tbilisi pressed for the return of its breakaway territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, which had allied themselves with Russia.
Meanwhile, President Saakashvili cemented his reputation as a Western ally by committing Georgian troops to the Nato-led coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Ill-feeling between Tbilisi and Moscow erupted into open war in August 2008, after Georgia made a lightning military assault on South Ossetia, where Russia kept a peacekeeping force.
Russian troops struck back rapidly, driving out President Saakashvili's soldiers and pushing into Georgia.
While they stopped short of a full invasion and eventually withdrew back into South Ossetia, the Russians had humiliated the Georgian leader.
Not only did Georgia's chances of regaining its territories look even more remote but its Nato ambitions were badly damaged, since a condition for membership of the alliance is the absence of territorial disputes.
Mr Saakashvili had already been re-elected as president before the war, although his share of the vote in January 2008 was sharply down, at 53%.
Internal political opposition to his rule has grown - a development that might be welcomed as a sign that a healthy democracy is taking root in Georgia.
However, Mr Saakashvili's opponents accuse him of exhibiting the very authoritarianism of which he has accused Kremlin leaders.
During huge street protests against alleged political corruption in 2007, his government used police to disperse demonstrators and declared a temporary state of emergency.
Protests demanding the president's resignation ended in bloodshed in 2011, and 2012 saw mass rallies in Tbilisi in protest at prison abuse, prompting Mr Saakashvili's interior minister to resign.
The prison scandal was a particularly sensitive issue for the president as he has made much of his law and order policies, eradicating much of the corruption that used to mar everyday life.
Critics also accuse Mr Saakashvili, the economic liberal, of having failed to tackle poverty. Although per capita GDP has nearly doubled since he took power it remains a fraction of that of Russia or Estonia.

It is feared that the attack could leave US security personnel or their families open to blackmail.
The agency involved, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), is yet to comment on the reports.
Officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Associated Press (AP) news agency, believe the attackers have targeted the forms submitted by intelligence and military personnel for security clearances.
The document includes personal information - everything from eye colour, to financial history, to past substance abuse, as well as contact details for the individual's friends and relatives.
A 127-page vetting document called Standard Form 86 may have been accessed. Among the questions potential employees are asked:
A White House statement said investigators had a ""high degree of confidence"" that background information on government employees had been accessed.
Joel Brenner, a former US counterintelligence official, called the data a ""gold mine"" for hackers.
It is also believed the breach of personal data of US government workers announced last week may be far larger than previously reported.
Initial estimates put the number of people potentially affected at four million, but officials close to the investigation told AP that as many as 14 million might be involved.
The US has said the hackers, thought to be behind both attacks, are believed to be based in China. Beijing called the claims ""irresponsible"".

The trust was rated as good overall for how caring its services were, but told it required improvement to ensure safe, effective and well-led services. It received an inadequate rating in relation to whether services were responsive.
Several initiatives within children and young people's services at Stoke were rated as outstanding in relation to whether they were caring.
Outstanding work was also seen in the specialised neurological unit at County Hospital, inspectors said.

537,539,"Research on 1,500 women aged 64 to 95 found those who spent many hours sitting and exercised for less than 40 minutes a day had cells that were biologically eight years older.
As people age, their cells age, causing DNA protectors to shorten and fray.
But health and lifestyle factors may speed up the process, researchers from California said.
Even in old age, it was important to keep active and avoid sitting for more than 10 hours a day, they said.
During ageing, tiny caps on the ends of DNA strands naturally shorten.
These telomeres - which have been likened to the plastic tips of shoelaces - are there to prevent chromosomes from deteriorating.
Telomere length is one indicator of biological age, which does not always match chronological age.
Shortened telomeres have been linked with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and major cancers.
How much regular exercise people do now also appears to be a factor in their length.
To track the women's movements in the study, they wore wore an accelerometer on their right hip for seven days in a row, during the day and night.
They were also asked to complete questionnaires on their activity.
Dr Aladdin Shadyab, lead study author, from the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, said: ""We found that women who sat for longer did not have shorter telomere length if they exercised for at least 30 minutes a day.
""Discussions about the benefits of exercise should start when we are young, and physical activity should continue to be part of our daily lives as we get older, even at 80 years old.""
The study is published in the American Journal of Epidemiology.
NHS Choices advises older adults to break up long periods of sitting with light activity because ""sedentary behaviour is now considered an independent risk factor for ill health"".

It said this was partly because it had not received security guarantees.
The port has also been targeted by warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition which is backing Yemen's government in its war with the rebel Houthi movement.
UN attempts to bring in five cranes to replace those damaged in the attacks have not been successful.
The ICRC's Middle East regional director Robert Mardini warned that Yemen, which depends on imports for 90% of its food supplies, was now living on its ""reserves"" and that the ""day will come very soon"" when they run out.
He said that despite the focus on the damage and casualties caused by the fighting, thousands of people were dying ""silently"" of complications due to malnutrition, or of minor illnesses or injuries which were not being treated at the 45% of health facilities that are still functioning.
The conflict, which escalated in March 2015, has left at least 7,500 people dead and 40,000 injured, according to the United Nations.
But almost 19 million people are in need of some form of humanitarian assistance.
Seven million people do not know where their next meal is coming from and more than three million, including 2.1 million children, are suffering from acute malnutrition.
The UN's emergency relief co-ordinator, Stephen O'Brien, called on the warring parties to guarantee more access to ports to let in food, fuel and medicine imports on Monday.
He told the BBC the situation was ""very desperate"", and that he had seen children so ""severely malnourished"" that he feared they would not survive another day.
Earlier this month, the UN appealed for $2.1bn (Â£1.7bn) to provide life-saving assistance to 12 million people in Yemen over the next year. But it has so far received only $43m.
On Tuesday, Mr O'Brien was forced to cancel a visit to the city of Taiz, which is besieged by rebel fighters, reportedly after his convoy came under fire.
In a separate development on Tuesday, UN human rights officials said they had evidence of the recruitment of child soldiers in Yemen, mostly by groups affiliated with the Houthis.

Official state channel Rossiya 1 TV said that while Kiev labelled the militia and protesters in the south-east as ""terrorists"", locals strongly disagreed. It showed some civilians insisting that they were not separatists.
""Kiev is threatening the citizens of Donetsk Region with psychological attacks from the air. Periodically, military helicopters and planes circle menacingly over the towns of Sloviansk and Kramatorsk,"" Rossiya 1 TV said.
Another strand of coverage by Russia's three main TV channels, though, has been to portray the Ukrainian army as weak, disorganised and suffering from poor service conditions and low morale.
One report by NTV - owned by state gas giant Gazprom - reported that Ukrainian troops had refused to take orders from their commanders and sided with pro-Russian militiamen, a presenter for NTV reported.
""Many servicemen are clearly confused and don't understand how they could point their guns at Ukrainians, the same people as them,"" the channel's correspondent says.
Russian TV channels have also been showing footage of what they say are local people in Donetsk and Luhansk regions confronting Ukrainian troops. In one instance, locals are seen persuading the crew of a tank not to shoot at civilians. In another, they stop and loot a military truck.
In contrast, Ukrainian TV channels have been supportive of what they see as the Kiev authorities' efforts to rein in ''separatists'' and ""militants supported by Russia"".
Ukrainian TV channels say ""small groups"" of violent protesters demanding federalisation or annexation by Russia do not reflect the true sentiment of residents of eastern Ukraine most of whom, they say, want to live in an undivided Ukraine.
They have been broadcasting comments from ordinary people in the streets of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv, most of them saying they want their region to stay in Ukraine.
The demands of some Ukrainians for action against the separatists also feature heavily. State-owned UT1 TV provided live coverage of a rally in Kiev's Independence Square, where around 10,000 people demanded that the authorities act more resolutely to protect the eastern regions from ""Russian aggression"".

Born in 1923 near Paris, she fled Nazi-occupied France with her then husband, prominent actor Marcel Dalio, in 1940.
The couple ended up in Hollywood, and both played in Casablanca.
In the film, Bogart plays an American cafe owner in Morocco, a territory controlled by France's Nazi collaborationist regime. He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her husband escape Casablanca to continue fighting the Nazis.

548,550,"Syed, 35, is serving a life sentence for the murder of Hae Min Lee in 1999.
His defence team is trying to reopen the case based on some of the questions raised in the Serial podcast over whether Syed had received a fair trial.
A judge in Baltimore has allowed lawyers to submit new evidence for the first time since his conviction.
Serial, which was released in weekly instalments at the end of last year, became a global hit, breaking records as the fastest podcast to reach five million downloads on iTunes.
In it, journalists went through every detail in the investigation into the death of Lee, for which her ex-boyfriend Syed was convicted. Apparent errors and possible new evidence were discovered by the Serial team, leading to calls for a new investigation.
Lawyers will now be allowed to present new evidence on two fronts: the reliability of mobile phone records and the testimony of a potential alibi.
In the 2000 trial, prosecutors relied heavily on mobile phone records that allegedly placed Syed at a park in Baltimore where Lee's body was buried. Syed, who was 17 at the time, has always maintained his innocence.
But a motion filed in court in August said a newly recovered mobile phone document showed ""the cell tower evidence was misleading and should have never been admitted at trial"".
The new hearing, a date for which has yet to be decided, will also hear evidence from a potential alibi for Syed.
Asia McClain, a friend of Syed's who was not heard in the original trial, claims to have seen him in a library at the time of the suspected killing.
The fact that Syed's first lawyer, Cristina Gutierrez, failed to submit this evidence in the original trial was one of the arguments used to win him the right to appeal in February.
Court papers show the hearing will also look at why Syed's defence team did not present Ms McLain as a witness and whether there was ""potential prosecutorial misconduct"" as a result.","Lawyers for Adnan Syed, the subject of the hit US podcast Serial, will be allowed to present new evidence in his case after a court ruling on Friday.",34753646,"Sure!

549,551,"He has frequently expressed his dislike of social media sites - including YouTube and Facebook - believing they are being used to attack him.
However, the Twitter ban has drawn widespread criticism, including from Turkish President Abdullah Gul who tweeted his disagreement.
But Mr Erdogan's troubles go far beyond social media. He is also facing allegations of corruption and is embroiled in a feud with a former ally.
Here's a look at some of the battles he is currently fighting.
Last month, an audio recording posted on an anonymous Twitter account appeared to show Mr Erdogan talking to his son about hiding large sums of money.
Mr Erdogan denounced it as a fake.
""I don't care what the international community says at all. Everyone will see the power of the Turkish Republic,"" Mr Erdogan said on Thursday.
However, millions of Turkish internet users continued to access Twitter, using proxy servers and other means. Twitter itself posted instructions, while in Istanbul, graffiti appeared with details of how to sidestep the ban.
Many of the prime minister's harshest critics have used Twitter to co-ordinate protests against him and circulate damaging information.
A law passed last month tightens government controls on the internet, allowing the Turkish authorities to block websites without first seeking a court ruling.
It will also force internet providers to store data on web users' activities for two years and make it available to the authorities.
The opposition and human rights organisations have criticised the move as an assault on freedom of expression.
The BBC also expressed concern after a reporter for BBC Turkish was attacked on social media by the mayor of Ankara.

BBC reporters 'intimidated' by Turkey
The recorded phone call posted on Twitter appears to show Mr Erdogan asking his son Bilal to dispose of millions of euros in cash from a house.
Mr Erdogan says the allegations are a plot by his enemies to oust him.
In December, three Turkish government ministers resigned after their sons were taken into custody by police investigating allegations of bribery for construction projects.
All three sons were later released.
One of the ministers later said a great number of the construction projects had been approved by Mr Erdogan himself and he called on the prime minister to resign.

Turkish ministers resign amid scandal
Once an ally of Mr Erdogan, Fethullah Gulen is an Islamic scholar who founded an influential social and cultural network which now includes more than 900 schools in Turkey.
Mr Gulen himself has lived in self-imposed exile in the US since 1999.
Followers of his Hizmet movement - whose name means ""service"" - are said to hold senior positions in the Turkish police, the judiciary and Mr Erdogan's AK Party itself.
However, Mr Gulen's critics believe Hizmet's aim is to gain power, to spread socially conservative Islamic attitudes on issues like marriage and alcohol around the globe, and to suppress any opposition.
Mr Erdogan has accused him of running a ""state within a state"" - an accusation he denies.
In December, Turkish pro-government media claimed prosecutors with ties to Mr Gulen had illegally wiretapped thousands of prominent figures.
Targets reportedly included government ministers and business leaders.
The claims were published a few hours ahead of the leaked recording said to be of Mr Erdogan.

Turkey prosecutors 'tapped phones'
The anger which led to last year's protests flared up again recently, with the news of the death of a 15-year-old boy who had been in a coma since last June.
Berkin Elvan was on his way to buy bread when he was hit on the head by a tear gas canister fired by police.
Mr Erdogan said the boy had links to ""terrorist organisations"".
His death brought the toll from last year's unrest to at least eight, including one policeman.
The protests began over plans to develop Istanbul's Gezi Park into a new mosque and shopping centre, but escalated into national demonstrations against what opponents see as Mr Erdogan's growing authoritarianism.

Erdogan accuses boy of 'terrorist links'
For many years, Mr Erdogan was held up as the role model for the leaders of Muslim countries, at ease with democracy and a pluralistic society. He has now been in power for 11 years. His critics say he is becoming increasingly autocratic.
Turkey is a member of Nato and is formally a candidate to join the European Union. European Commission Vice-President Neelie Kroes took to Twitter to voice her disappointment at the Twitter ban: ""The Twitter ban in #Turkey is groundless, pointless, cowardly. Turkish people and intl community will see this as censorship. It is.""
The German government also criticised the ban, as did the US-based research and pressure group Human Rights Watch, which called it a ""fundamental blow to freedom of expression"".
Mr Erdogan is likely to shrug off criticism from his foreign critics. But local elections are due to take place on 30 March, and the Turkish prime minister will have no choice but to listen to the voters' verdict.","Turkey has blocked the social networking site Twitter following Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's vow to ""wipe out"" the service.",26680033,"Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing numerous challenges, including allegations of corruption, a feud with a former ally, and widespread criticism for his recent ban on Twitter, which has been met with defiance from millions of Turkish internet users and criticism from foreign governments and human rights organizations.",0,"Article: {}

552,554,"Speaking to the BBC at the Paris Airshow, Mr Bregier said the aircraft manufacturer was committed to its 16,000 employees based in the UK.
He added Airbus had no plans to relocate its British factories.
Airbus has said in the past that a ""Brexit"" might change its plans.
Last month, Airbus UK's chief executive, Paul Kahn, said that if the UK voted to leave the EU in the planned in-out referendum, Airbus would reconsider future investment in the UK.
On Tuesday, Mr Bregier admitted he would have to make a judgement about what the consequences would be for the competitiveness of his business following the referendum.
His comments come as ministers tabled an amendment to the EU referendum bill on Monday evening, ruling out holding the plebiscite on 5 May 2016, the same day as Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish assembly elections and local elections.
It means the referendum is unlikely to take place before the autumn of 2016, depending on the prime minister's ability to negotiate concessions from his European counterparts and despite calls for the UK to get the vote over with.
Businesses have repeated raised concerns about the level of uncertainty caused by the timing of the referendum and the potential economic harm caused as investment decisions are delayed as a result.
Last month, Mr Kahn said the UK must compete for international investment.
""The best way to guarantee this is by remaining part of the EU,"" he said.
""I believe that it is vital for a company such as Airbus to come out and make a stand in favour of Britain remaining in the European Union.""
Airbus, the world's second-largest aircraft manufacturer after Boeing, employs 6,000 people at its site at Broughton, north Wales, where it assembles the wings for all Airbus aircraft.
Several thousand more people are employed at Filton, near Bristol, designing wings and testing landing gear.
Mr Kahn stressed that if the UK were to leave the EU, the company would not suddenly close.
But he added: ""If after an exit from the European Union, economic conditions in Britain were less favourable for business than in other parts of Europe, or beyond, would Airbus reconsider future investment in the United Kingdom? Yes, absolutely.""
Airbus is one of Europe's biggest industrial enterprises spanning civil aviation, defence and space, with operations in Germany, France and Spain.
In the event of a British exit from the EU, Mr Kahn suggested the company could face more red tape in areas such as work visas and trade barriers.
He said he was not ""blindly supporting Britain's membership of the EU"", adding: ""I welcome the UK government's intentions to deliver positive and hoped-for reforms - which would create a leaner and more efficient EU.""","Airbus chief executive Fabrice Bregier has said he has ""no intention"" of pulling manufacturing out of the UK if the country votes to leave the European Union (EU).",33146011,"Sure!

He said he had been wrongfully arrested and that his home had been unlawfully searched.
The man said his wife was ""hysterical"" at finding police in the garden.
He was taken inside his house and arrested in connection with a firearms offence which had happened the previous day, before being taken into custody at a police station.
The man was later released when police realised he was not the person they were looking for.
When a Police Ombudsman investigator examined police files, he found that the issue lay with an incorrectly recorded date of birth in a handover information pack provided to the officer who organised the search.
The officer who compiled the pack had recorded the name and address of another man of the same name, but had mistakenly added the complainant's date of birth.
The officer who co-ordinated the search said she had checked the details in the handover pack, but found no-one of that name living at the address.
She then searched for a more up-to-date address using the complainant's name and date of birth, which resulted in his arrest and home being searched.
The officer who recorded the wrong date of birth admitted his mistake and ""apologised to the complainant and his family for the upset and annoyance which resulted"".

Bauke Mollema finished sixth to go second in the overall standings.
There were doubts the stage would go ahead after Thursday's attack in Nice.
Tour officials decided to continue with the race, with a heightened security presence, after at least 84 people were killed when a lorry drove through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day in the southern French city.
There was a sombre atmosphere at both the start and finish lines on stage 13, with most riders not learning of the news from Nice until they woke up on Friday morning.
""We want this day to be a day of dignity as a tribute to the victims,"" said race director Christian Prudhomme. ""The race must continue.""
There was a minute's silence held before the first rider set off on the course, and another minute's silence was observed as the jersey holders stood on stage after the day's racing had finished.
The riders, including Froome, placed their bouquets of flowers on an empty podium in a symbolic tribute for the victims in Nice.
Froome, who lives in Monaco, just 12 miles (20km) from Nice, said: ""This is definitely a time for people to stand together. It definitely puts things into perspective for us.
""I'm happy with how the stage went but everyone's thoughts are with the people in Nice. It's a special place for me, close to where I'm based, and I can't imagine what everyone is going through.""
Stage winner Dumoulin added: ""On one side I'm a very happy man but on the other side it's a very sad day.
""I woke up to the terrible news from Nice and there was a question whether we should race. It was a just decision in the end to race. It's terrible what happened and it shadows the day a lot.""
On the road, it proved to be a crucial day for 2013 and 2015 champion Froome, as he increased his lead on all of his yellow jersey rivals.
Last year the 31-year-old collected the yellow jersey on stage seven and never relinquished it.
""There will be a strong breakaway group but it will probably come back together and end in a bunch sprint finish""
Read Geraint's preview of stage 14
And since wearing the maillot jaune on stage eight this year, the Team Sky rider has continued to put more time between himself and the other contenders.
His time trial may have been one minute three seconds slower than Dumoulin's superb stage-winning pace, but he was almost two minutes quicker than Mollema, who is now his closest threat for the overall lead.
Fellow Briton Adam Yates, 23, dropped from second to third, but continues to have a remarkable Tour, finishing seven seconds quicker than the highly regarded Nairo Quintana.
Colombian Quintana looks devoid of form, having been unable to chase Froome, Mollema and Richie Porte up Mont Ventoux on Thursday, and now falling to fourth and two minutes 59 seconds off the lead.
The comprehensive stage victory for Dumoulin strengthens the widely held belief that the 25-year-old has the potential to win a future Grand Tour - which includes the Giro d'Italia and La Vuelta.

The Home Office said it was ""encouraged"" that so many retailers had been ""denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade"".
However, the charity DrugWise said the ban had driven the market underground.
Legal highs became popular on the drug scene around 2008. They contain substances which mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy and go by names such as Spice and Black Mamba.
What are legal highs?
'Legal highs made me punch my own face'
Laws criminalising the production, distribution, sale and supply of the drugs - known as the Psychoactive Substances Act - came into effect at the end of May.
Commander Simon Bray, from the National Police Chiefs Council, said London's Metropolitan Police had also seized nearly 14,000 nitrous oxide or laughing gas canisters since the change.
Mr Bray said although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact on use of the drugs, ""intuitively I think it must have had an effect"".
""It will certainly make it less easy for the casual first-time user to get involved in this sort of stuff,"" he said adding that he believed many people were ""lulled into buying these things"" thinking they were legal and therefore safe.
The Angelus Foundation, which educates people on the risks of legal highs, said it believed many online traders had also shut down.
Jeremy Sare, director of communications at the charity, told the BBC: ""I think the ban has made a big difference and we are supportive of the legislation.
""What we are surprised about is the online supply hasn't surged. Traders seem to have stopped selling. It is still early days and we may look back in 12 months and see more online trading but many look to have closed.
""Many were operating within the law but now the law has gone against them so they haven't continued.""
He said the two biggest groups still using the drugs were homeless people and prisoners.
Greg, originally from Essex and now living in west Wales, told BBC Radio 5 live about his experience of a legal high known as Holy Smoke.
""I had just a little bit... My head just started spinning and I had this paranoid feeling. I just wanted to go home and hide but I couldn't walk properly. I honestly thought that I was going to die.
""From what I've heard it is still pretty regularly available. I think most people still think it's legal.""
""Alison"" a recovering drug user, has also used legal highs. ""They've got names like Train Wreck, Black Cobra and Pandora's Box,"" she said. ""It's still really easy to get. You can get three packets for about Â£25.
""No prices have changed. Nothing has changed at all. People are still walking around with it and selling it from home. I don't think it [the ban] has made one bit of difference.""
However, Harry Shapiro, director of DrugWise, said although the ban may have put off ""casual and curious"" drug users, it had not deterred those with a serious drug problem and had driven the market underground.
""It's moved from the shops to the street,"" he said.
The drugs have been linked to 444 deaths since 2010, including two brothers from Scotland.
William McGough, 30, was in the grip of an addiction to the drugs when he drowned in a river in Wick, Scotland, in 2013.
Then, in May, the body of his brother Simon, 37, was found next to a packet of the psychoactive substances.
Their sister, Melanie Downie, 40, spoke publicly about their deaths to highlight the ""addictive and destructive"" nature of the drugs.
Sarah Newton the government's safeguarding minister, said the drugs ""have already cost far too many lives"".
""I'm encouraged to see that - three months in - police are using their new powers to take dealers off our streets and that so many retailers have been denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade.""

Allergy sufferers often have several pens - one to keep at home, as well as others at school or work, or in the car. They also expire after 12 months.
Mylan chief executive Heather Bresch said the company had spent hundreds of millions of dollars improving the product since buying the product from Merck in 2007.
""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response,"" she said. ""We determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option.""
The move is unusual because the branded version is still under patent and other rival treatments have failed to get regulatory clearance. The product generates annual sales of $1bn for Mylan.
Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal said: ""We suspect Mylan will continue to receive some heat for its price increases and there will be heightened pressure on FDA [regulator the Food and Drug Administration] to bring competition to the market.""
Ms Bresch also blamed the complex US health care system for the price rises and said that Mylan took just $274 of the $600 list price, while insurers, pharmacies and other parties shared the rest.
How much individuals pay for an EpiPen prescription can depend on their insurance coverage.
Politicians and parents have challenged the price hikes, with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton calling them ""outrageous"" and unjustified.
The outcry over EpiPen price rises sent Mylan shares falling about 12% last week. The stock was flat at $43.04 in afternoon trading in New York.
Actor Sarah Jessica Parker, who had endorsed EpiPens, said last week she was ending her relationship with Mylan. She had previously spoken about the importance of the treatment to her family because of her son's peanut allergy.

The planned system would see passengers transported in gondolas along a route from Cardiff central train station.
CBC chairman Nigel Roberts said it would carry 2,500 tourists and commuters every hour.
He said: ""The great thing about Cardiff Bay is that when you get up into the air you can get a phenomenal view.""
If plans get off the ground, the gondolas would pass through the city's Central Square and Cardiff Bay before terminating in Penarth.
The scheme, which would cost about £20m per mile, could be funded from the Welsh transport budget, the private sector and sponsorship, Mr Roberts suggested.

564,566,"British police accuse him of stealing $250m (£160m) over eight years.
The prosecutor called him a ""thief in government house"".
Ibori, once seen as one of Nigeria's wealthiest and most influential politicians, was arrested in 2010 in Dubai and then extradited to London.
Some $35m of his alleged UK assets were frozen in 2007.
As his trial at London's Southwark Crown Court was about to begin, Mr Ibori changed his plea to guilty and admitted stealing money from Delta state and laundering it in London through a number of offshore companies.
The BBC's Chris Summers says between 20 and 30 of Mr Ibori's supporters turned up to court - some wearing T-shirts with the slogan ""Free Ibori"". There was not enough room for them all in the public gallery.
Prosecuting QC Sasha Wass said Mr Ibori, 53, had ""tricked"" his way into becoming Delta state governor, by giving a false date of birth and claiming he had no criminal record.
""He was never the legitimate governor and there was effectively a thief in government house. As the pretender of that public office, he was able to plunder Delta state's wealth and hand out patronage.""
He is due to be sentenced on 16 April.
Ibori's wife, Theresa, his sister, Christine, his mistress, Udoamaaka Okoronkwo, and his London solicitor, Bhadresh Gohil, have all been convicted of money-laundering.
Their convictions could only be reported on Monday after reporting restrictions were lifted.
Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) had asked the UK's Metropolitan Police to look into the ex-governor's financial affairs.
""The vast sums of money involved were used to fund Mr Ibori's lavish lifestyle,"" Detective Inspector Paul Whatmore, the officer in charge of the investigation, said.
""We will now be actively seeking the confiscation of all of his stolen assets so they can be repatriated for the benefit of the people of Delta State.""
He said that the money Ibori stole should have been used to pay for sanitation, power supplies and healthcare for some of the poorest people in the world.
Ibori spent some of the stolen money buying six houses in London - he paid £2.2m in cash for one Hampstead mansion - and put his children in expensive British private schools, police say.
Three of the money-laundering charges relate to the sale of Delta state's share in mobile phone company V-Mobile to neighbouring Akwa Ibom state.
This raised $37m which Ibori stole and laundered through his solicitor Gohil, who has been jailed for 10 years.
In 2007, a UK court froze assets allegedly belonging to him worth $35m.
His annual salary as Delta state governor was less than $25,000.
He had already left the UK when his assets were seized but he was arrested in Nigeria later that year.
The charges were dismissed but he was then re-arrested in Dubai on a British warrant.
Ibori has been convicted in the UK before - in 1991 for stealing, in cahoots with his wife who worked as a cashier, from the Neasden, London, branch of the DIY shop Wickes.
He was also found guilty in 1992 for being in possession of a stolen credit card and having used it to fraudulently withdraw $1,590.
Nigeria is one of the world's biggest oil producers. Under its federal system, state governors enjoy huge powers and control budgets larger than those of many West African countries.

Ms Jones will present a One Show special from Cardiff on Friday, the eve of the men's match.
The 40-year-old, who returned from maternity leave to the BBC One show part-time in April, said she was excited to be in the city for an event of such magnitude.
""Working in Cardiff is a dream for me - the city will be buzzing,"" she said.

Penguin Books has promised to push the book in the same ""radical"" manner as Morrissey's autobiography, which was published under its classic imprint.
The artist has selected journalist James Fox as his ghostwriter.
Fox was the writer behind Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards' autobiography, as well as the book White Mischief, which recounted the Happy Valley murder case in Kenya in 1941.
Hirst was one of the founding members of the Young British Artists (YBA) movement, which also counted Tracey Emin, Sarah Lucas and Mark Wallinger amongst its numbers.
Many of them were students at Goldsmiths College in London in the late 1980s. Their first major exhibition, in a warehouse, attracted a number of influential art collectors, including Charles Saatchi - who would later become one of his Hirst's greatest supporters.
Hirst's work - which includes spot paintings and a sheep and shark preserved in formaldehyde - has frequently had the ability to shock.
A two-day auction of his work in 2008 raised a record-breaking Â£111m.
Speaking on the Today programme, Fox said: ""He (Hirst) grew up in a pretty bad situation, with his mother, and he and his gang - many of whom became YBA artists, spent half their time housebreaking, stealing, [indulging in] criminality, and the rest of their time indulging their passion for art, which started very early on in their years.

Congratulations to Thomas Hitzlsperger - welcome to the club!
Bayern Munich, the club where Hitzlsperger began his career as a junior, also tweeted their support for the midfielder's ""brave step"".
Hitzlsperger's announcement is seen as a watershed moment in Germany, which like England has struggled with the problem of homophobia in football.
Zwanziger admitted that football was ""now as ever a hard business, where unfortunately an open discourse about homosexuality is still not taken for granted"".
Current Germany captain Philipp Lahm created controversy in 2011 when he wrote in his autobiography that he would encourage gay footballers to keep quiet about their sexuality.
""I would not encourage any gay professional footballer to come out,"" he wrote at the time. ""I would fear that he would end up like Justin Fashanu [the English footballer who killed himself after revealing that he was gay].""
The last German footballer to come out was second tier player Marcus Urban, who told Die Welt in 2007 that he knew of at least three gay footballers in the Bundesliga who were too scared to reveal their sexuality.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman Steffen Seibert praised Hitzlsperger for going public.
""It's good that he's spoken about something which is important to him,"" Seibert told a media briefing.
""We live in a country where nobody should be worried about making his sexuality known or concerned about intolerance.
""We judge footballers on whether they have behaved well and worthily on and off the pitch and I believe that both are the case with Mr Hitzlsperger.""
Openly Gay German politician Volker Beck said he hoped Hitzlsperger's announcement would encourage others to do the same.
""I hope that Hitzlsperger's courageous step contributes to finally breaking down this taboo,"" he said. ""It's now the job of the German FA to embolden active players [to do the same].""
And Zwanziger said he was optimistic that Hitzlsperger's announcement would lead to greater openness about sexuality in German football.

And he said he would be worried if such a view ""translated into power"".
Mr Corbyn called on the defence secretary to ""take action"" against Sir Nicholas over his comments.
In a statement, the Labour leader said: ""It is a matter of serious concern that the chief of the defence staff has today intervened directly in issues of political dispute.
""It is essential in a democracy that the military remains politically neutral at all times.
""By publicly taking sides in current political arguments, Sir Nicholas Houghton has clearly breached that constitutional principle. Accordingly, I am writing to the defence secretary to ask him to take action to ensure that the neutrality of the armed forces is upheld.""
Mr Corbyn, a leading member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, sparked a row with his shadow cabinet at his party's annual conference when he revealed that would never press the ""nuclear button"" - and he has since praised Scottish Labour's rejection of Trident.
Mr Corbyn has said he was elected Labour leader on a platform of opposing Trident renewal and that he is committed to ""promoting an international nuclear weapons convention which would lead to a nuclear-free world"".
Asked about Mr Corbyn's refusal to use nuclear weapons, Sir Nicholas said: ""It would worry me if that thought was translated into power as it were.""
He added: ""The whole thing about deterrence rests on the credibility of its use.
""When people say you're never going to use the deterrent, what I say is you use the deterrent every second of every minute of every day and the purpose of the deterrent is that you don't have to use it because you successfully deter.
""If a prime minister said they would never press the nuclear button, ""the deterrent is then completely undermined,"" he added.
""Most of the politicians I know understand that and I think that, dare I say, the responsibility of power is probably quite a sobering thing and you come to a realisation, 'I understand how this thing works'.""
Attending a wreath-laying ceremony in his Islington North constituency following the Remembrance Sunday commemorations at the Cenotaph, Mr Corbyn said Sir Nicholas's comments had been ""unhelpful"".
""I would gently say to him, with the greatest of respect, we live in a democracy where politicians are elected to Parliament in order to take political decisions,"" he told Channel 4 News.
""If he's worried, I think he should talk to me about it. I don't think it is appropriate for serving officers to make political comments or engage in political debate.""
Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle told Andrew Marr she was leading an ""open-minded"" review of the policy in light of Mr Corbyn's views and a vote by Scottish Labour against the renewal of Trident.
She said she had yet to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss Trident but a date was in her diary.
But she appeared to back Sir Nicholas, telling Andrew Marr: ""I understand the point that he is making. It is the point that I made myself when Jeremy said what he said.""
She defended the right of Britain's most senior military figure to speak out on such a politically sensitive issue.
""I don't think there is anything wrong with him expressing himself in those terms,"" she said.
She indicated she could resign if there was any change to the party's current position in favour of renewing the Trident submarine fleet.
""I am not a unilateral nuclear disarmer. I don't believe that that works.

575,577,"Joe Murphy's scrambled early goal was the ideal start for Down and they led 1-8 to 0-6 at half-time.
With Caolan Mooney starring, the Mournemen extended their advantage to six midway through the second half.
Meath reduced Down's lead but they home side held on after a nervous finish.
Down went into the game propping up Division Two after disappointing opening defeats by Fermanagh and Clare.
County secretary Sean Og McAteer felt compelled to release a length statement on Thursday night denying reports of unrest within Eamonn Burns' squad and Saturday's win will be a huge boost for the management.
After hammering Derry at Navan two weeks ago, Meath were favourites heading into the Pairc Esler contest but the Mournemen produced a performance of grit and determination to chisel out the vital Division Two victory.
Murphy's goal, as he flicked a mishit Darragh O'Hanlon free past Paddy O'Rourke, was the perfect start for the home side as they were never headed in the contest.
With midfielder Peter Turley putting himself about and former under-age star Mooney producing his best game in the Down senior jersey, the home side pushed on from leading only 1-1 to 0-3 to move five ahead by the interval.
O'Hanlon slotted three first-half frees while the impressive Conor Maginn, Barry O'Hagan (two), Ryan Johnston and Aidan Carr also got on the scoresheet for Down in the opening period.
Fresh from his Sigerson Cup heroics with St Mary's, Kevin McKernan also excelled in the opening period for the Mournement as Meath laboured, with free-taker Donal Lenihan hitting three of their points.
A McKernan point extended Down's lead to 1-11 to 0-8 by the 52nd minute after a great block at the other end by Carr had prevented Brian Menton for netting a Meath goal.
After their struggles in recent times, it was not a surprise to see Down attempting to hold on to their lead in the closing stages and Meath, helped by the introduction of the speedy Eamonn Wallace, reduced the margin to three by the time the game entered injury time.
Inevitably, there was a late scare for Down as Lenihan aimed for goal from his last-gasp 13-metre free and the ball skimmed off the crossbar over for a point before the final whistle was blown seconds later.

576,578,"Ch Insp David Pettigrew believes the cameras would act as a deterrent to disorder and vandalism.
Glasgow City Council said the implementation of cameras had been explored but the topography of the site made it difficult.
The Glasgow Necropolis is a historic cemetery and tourist attraction.
The 37-acre Victorian cemetery, east of the city centre, contains about 3,500 monuments and sculptures.
Ch Insp Pettigrew, the officer in charge of the Necropolis area, told the BBC: ""At this time of year, it is not the same as the spring and summer months. This is an area where people come to drink. They do that because it is out the way.
""That brings with it anti-social behaviours and disorder, whether deliberate or otherwise. It damages the headstones as well, so there is a clearly a disrespectful aspect to that. The headstones have been here for hundreds of years and can be loose, and if they fall over they can cause serious injury.
""Primarily, we are talking about drinking in the Necropolis. Gang activity in the east end in general is very much in the decline in recent years.""
Ch Insp Pettigrew said police officers take part in regular patrols of the necropolis during the spring and summer months, supported by teams from Community Safety Glasgow, who work in close consultation with the city council.
The senior officer said the teams from Community Safety sometimes patrol the area with mobile CCTV vans but he would like to see this taken a step further.
He added: ""CCTV has proven to be an effective aide to policing in many other parts of the city, so I think it would go without saying that it would be a benefit to this area also.
""The cameras themselves act as a deterrent because when people know they are here, they clearly don't have the same advantage as being able to hide behind a bush or a tree, but in the event that something happens it gives us the opportunity to find the people responsible. Quite clearly, we cannot be here 24 hours a day.""
Police Scotland told the BBC they only received six reports of crime at the necropolis between April and August 2015 - four of vandalism, one breach of the peace and once incidence of drinking in a public place. Three people were reported to the procurator fiscal over these incidents.
The Friends of Glasgow Necropolis are a group of volunteers who conduct tours of the cemetery, and raise money for conservation and restoration work at the Necropolis.
Ruth Johnston, the group's chairwoman, said: ""I don't think it (anti-social behaviour at the Necropolis) is any different from a large park in a very large city. We bring a lot of tourists here.
""People feel very safe coming in here, and there wouldn't be so many people coming if they didn't feel safe.
""The Glasgow Necropolis is incredibly inspiring, no matter what your interests are - history, social history, archaeology, architecture, sculpture. Some of the most famous sculptors have done work here.""
Alexander ""Greek"" Thomson and Charles Rennie Mackintosh are among those whose work is at the Necropolis, while William Miller - the man who wrote the Wee Willie Winkie nursery rhyme - is also buried there.
A memorial for Glasgow firefighters is one of 3,500 in the cemetery, with an estimated 50,000 people buried at the site in total.
Next year, the Friends of Glasgow Necropolis hopes to raise Â£60,000 for the restoration of the Monteith mausoleum, and they will continue commemorations for those who died in World War One and other conflicts.
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said: ""Community Safety Glasgow currently deploy two daily security patrols, staggered day and night, to the Necropolis and random mobile CCTV patrols are also conducted in the area to deter and detect antisocial behaviour. Foot patrols are also carried out within the Necropolis to deter dog fouling.
""There are also quarterly meetings between Police Scotland, the council, Community Safety Glasgow and the Friends of the Necropolis group to discuss any issues.
""The possibility of using re-deployable CCTV in the Necropolis was also explored, but the topography of the site made it difficult in terms of radio signalling.""
A spokesperson for Historic Environment Scotland, which is a statutory consultee for the Glasgow Necropolis, added: ""We are aware that there has been an issue with vandalism and anti-social behaviour at Glasgow Necropolis.
""Whilst we are not aware of any recent requests to Glasgow City Council planning department regarding the potential installation of CCTV we would be happy to discuss this and other proposals for improving security within the grounds of the Necropolis with them.

They argued he misled the electorate over a memo claiming SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon would rather have seen David Cameron become prime minister.
Judges have ruled that there will now be a ""By Order hearing"" to discuss the next part of the case.
Lady Paton and Lord Matthews had heard a preliminary legal debate at a special Election Court, which examined three questions.
The first was whether section 106 of the act - which makes it illegal to make or publish false statements about any candidate during an election campaign - could apply to candidates talking about themselves, as well as attacks on their rivals.
The judges have ruled that the language used in section 106 was ""wide enough to encompass a statement made by a candidate about himself"".
However, they said they wanted to hear evidence about the two remaining issues before issuing a determination on the case.
These are whether the words were false statements of fact which related to Mr Carmichael's personal character or conduct, and whether they were said ""for the purpose of affecting the return of any candidate at the election"".
The judges said they wanted to hear evidence on these issues because each case had to be considered on its own facts.
Lady Paton said: ""Circumstances can be envisaged where a false statement of fact is of such a nature that the effect in relation to a candidate's personal character or conduct transcends the political context.
""The question of the type of relationship between the statement and the personal character and conduct of the first respondent is one which requires evidence, including evidence as to the motive or reason for giving the false statement.""
Mr Carmichael's QC had asked the judges to dismiss the case, on the grounds it was ""irrelevant"" and ""bound to fail"".
Legal argument was heard at a special election court in Edinburgh earlier this month, which was broadcast and streamed online live.
The case is believed to be the first of its kind in Scotland for 50 years.
It arose from a story in the Daily Telegraph at the start of the general election campaign in April.
Mr Carmichael - Scottish Secretary in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition before the election - had authorised the leaking of a civil service memo suggesting First Minister Nicola Sturgeon had told the French ambassador she wanted David Cameron to remain in Downing Street.
He claimed in a TV interview the first he had heard of it was when he received a phone call from a journalist.

The EU said the verdict posed ""serious questions"" about the state of Russian law. The US said it was ""deeply disappointed"".
Before he was handcuffed and led away, Navalny urged his supporters to continue his anti-corruption struggle, tweeting: ""Don't sit around doing nothing.""
Navalny has previously said he would like to stand for president one day.
He had recently registered his candidacy for the next mayor of Moscow, but his campaign team said that after the verdict he was withdrawing from the race, and called on his supporters to boycott the vote.
By Oleg BoldyrevBBC News, Kirov
Minutes after Judge Blinov started reading from the substantial sheaf of papers, it became evident the two defendants, Alexei Navalny and Pyotr Ofitserov, were going to be found guilty.
Seasoned observers of this trial were just about able to pick up the judge's words. Others were bewildered by the hum-like reading.
Entering the courtroom just before the verdict reading started, both defendants were far from gloomy. ""Why sad faces?"" quipped Navalny, walking past dozens of journalists and a row of cameras.
Navalny has long acquired the skill of tweeting and blogging while interminable financial documents were read by prosecution, defence and, now, judge.
Publishing his fiery comments on politics, corruption and the need to unite in opposition to Vladimir Putin's regime - that's one of the many things he won't be able to do from behind bars, waiting for the sentence to be appealed against.
'Explosion of anger'
The BBC's Moscow correspondent Daniel Sandford says that when the sentence was handed down, there were tears from Navalny's supporters and an explosion of anger on the social networking sites that he has used so effectively.
Anti-Putin activist and former cabinet minister Boris Nemtsov told reporters the trial was ""completely fabricated from start to finish, and even the judge could not say what the reason for the crime was"".
Other countries have also voiced their concern at the verdict. The US ambassador to Moscow, Michael McFaul, said: ""We are deeply disappointed in the conviction of Navalny and the apparent political motivations in this trial.""
A spokesperson for the EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, said the embezzlement charges were unsubstantiated, and that Navalny's jailing posed ""serious questions as to the state of the rule of law in Russia"".
French foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot added his concern, but said: ""We note that not all judicial remedies have been exhausted and that the sentence could be reviewed on appeal.""
Navalny's supporters in Moscow have vowed to stage protests against the verdict later on Thursday.
'Almost inevitable'
Navalny arrived at the courtroom in Kirov to hear the verdict after a 12-hour overnight train journey from Moscow.
Our correspondent said Navalny smiled in a resigned manner when the almost inevitable guilty verdict came.
His wife, Yulia Navalnaya, said her husband knew he would get a non-suspended sentence and was mentally prepared to go to prison.
Navalny was found guilty of heading a group that embezzled timber worth 16m rubles ($500,000; Â£330,000) from the Kirovles state timber company while working as an adviser to Kirov's governor Nikita Belykh.
The prosecution had asked for a six-year jail sentence, but judge Sergei Blinov decided on five years, and said there were no extenuating circumstances that would warrant keeping Navalny out of prison.
Navalny's co-accused, Pyotr Ofitserov, was also found guilty, and given a four-year jail sentence.
""Navalny... committed a grave crime,"" said Judge Blinov as he delivered the sentence.
State television has only shown limited interest in the process despite Navalny's prominence, but online the trial has been followed extensively.
Mr Navalny came to public attention when he inspired mass protests against the Kremlin and President Vladimir Putin in December 2011.
Profile: Alexei Navalny
A thorn in Putin's side
Judge Blinov said he found the testimony of the main prosecution witness, Vyacheslav Opalev, to be ""trustworthy and consistent''.
Navalny insists that Mr Opalev spoke against him out of revenge, because Navalny had recommended he be fired and his company investigated for corruption.
After the verdict, Navalny tweeted: ""So that's it. Don't get bored without me. Most importantly, don't sit around doing nothing. The toad won't get off the oil pipe by itself.""
In his LiveJournal blog on Wednesday Navalny said: ""The current authorities are not a big, healthy fish, but rather a bloated fish or Latin American toad, which puffs itself up when it sees danger, with the help of television.""
In an unusual step, the court allowed the whole trial to be broadcast live online.
He is now one of the key figures of the opposition - a thorn in the side of the political establishment, campaigning against the endemic corruption, our correspondent says.

Prison Reform Trust director Juliet Lyon said: ""Providing people with the knowledge and skills to help them lead a law-abiding life on release should be a central aim of a modern and effective penal system.""
Mr Gove said: ""We have more than 80,000 adults in our custody.

Under the UN resolution which set up the mission, Syria's chemical weapons production equipment must be destroyed by 1 November and stockpiles must be disposed of by mid-2014.
The organisation's work in Syria marks the first time the international chemical weapons watchdog - which won this year's Nobel Peace Prize - has been asked to oversee the destruction of a weapons armoury during a conflict.
More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years, according to the UN.
More than two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been forced from their homes within the country.

585,587,"Mr de Mistura said the agenda would include the formation of a transitional administration and elections.
But it is not clear who will attend the indirect talks in Geneva, with some opposition leaders yet to confirm.
On the ground in Syria, a partial truce that began 12 days ago has considerably reduced the intensity of the fighting.
Mr de Mistura said the cessation of hostilities was holding ""by and large"" and was open-ended as far as the UN was concerned.
The first round of talks on a political solution to the conflict in Syria was suspended last month while still in the ""preparatory"" phase, with both sides blaming each other.
It came as government forces, backed by Russian air strikes, launched a major offensive on opposition-controlled areas around the northern city of Aleppo.
The government succeeded in cutting a key rebel supply route from Turkey to Aleppo before the US and Russia brokered the cessation of hostilities agreement, which does not include the jihadist groups Islamic State (IS) and al-Nusra Front.
At a news conference in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr de Mistura welcomed what he described as ""a sustained reduction of violence"".
""Incidents are taking place, no question and they are. I'm expecting even worse incidents to take place, probably caused by spoilers,"" he added.
""The secret will be whether the sides are in a position, as so far touch wood has been the case, [to] contain them, make them not become an unravelling of what has been after five years quite a change... for the life of every Syrian.""
Mr de Mistura said he expected informal discussions to begin at hotels across Geneva immediately, but that formal talks would not resume until Monday.
He added that they would once again be indirect ""proximity"" talks, with representatives of the warring parties located in separate rooms, and would last only 10 days before pausing for a week.
""We believe that having a timetable and a time limit is healthy for everyone so that we don't think that we can go onâ€¦ for two weeks hoping to get into substance - we go seriously into substance as soon as we can.""
The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says the focus of the talks will be a transitional government, a new constitution, and elections. Humanitarian access and ceasefire violations will not be on the agenda.
The UN has set up two taskforces to deal with those issues, and clearly wants the opposition and government representatives to concentrate on a political settlement, our correspondent adds.
UN aid agencies say good progress has been made getting supplies to besieged areas, with almost 240,000 people reached, most of whom received nothing in the last year.
But our correspondent says it remains unclear exactly who will arrive in Geneva on Monday, with some opposition leaders suggesting they have not yet decided whether to attend.
Meanwhile, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein told the BBC that the international system had failed Syria.
""We've seen in this conflict... almost every conceivable war crime allegedly being committed, in addition to crimes against humanity,"" he said.
""What does it say to us? It says... that the international system is incapable of addressing this sort of conflict.

But the South American side scarcely deserved to take the game into extra-time after a very patchy performance, particularly in defence.
Mano Menezes's team had scored three in each of their previous five games and were treating the tournament as an important staging post ahead of hosting the World Cup in 2014.
But if they are to succeed on home soil they will have to show a significant improvement from what they produced at Wembley, with star forward Neymar a largely peripheral figure.
Menezes went into Saturday's match under huge pressure to deliver gold and fill the one significant missing blank for the Brazilian team, but if the game was to be Brazil's coronation as Olympic champions then Mexico clearly had not read the script.

They defeated Brazil 2-0 in a friendly earlier in the summer and stunned Wembley when Peralta's low strike nestled in the bottom corner while many inside the stadium were still taking their seats.
Manchester United defender Rafael was partly at fault for the goal, his sloppy pass allowing Javier Aquino to nip in and dispossess Sandro, with the ball running invitingly into the path of Peralta.
Brazil could not find their stride - a situation not helped by a series of niggly fouls that broke up play and angered coach Menezes, who could be seen waving an imaginary card on the touchline.
And their disappointing start was put into stark perspective when Menezes made a change just after the half-hour mark, bringing on Hulk for Alex Sandro.
""Mexico deserve it, Brazil were arrogant and sloppy. They just thought they could turn up and win. It was a shocking performance from Brazil. They started poorly and continued in that vein.""
The substitution made a difference and Jose Corona managed to palm clear a swerving strike from Hulk while Marcelo shot wastefully wide after he had linked with Oscar and Leandro Damiao to carve open the left side of the Mexican defence.
By the early stages of the second half it was obvious that Mexico had opted to try to defend their lead.
This seemed to play into the hands of their opponents, particularly Neymar, who had disappointed in the opening half but briefly relished the chance to repeatedly run at the Mexico defence.
He twice shot wide and saw another effort blocked, but his influence soon faded and Mexico almost struck with a swift break.
There was more shoddy Brazilian defending involved too, as Fabian dispossessed an opponent far too easily and eventually saw his overhead effort rebound off the crossbar.
An unmarked Peralta later slotted home from six yards but Brazil were saved by the offside flag. There was to be no reprieve with 15 minutes remaining.
A free-kick was delivered from the right and the Mexico striker was left completely alone to head home from eight yards.

""I was about to leave, but they will think I wanted to leave because we had difficulty with the game.""
AC Milan were down to 10 men at the time when the Serie A fixture at their San Siro stadium was temporarily stopped. The game only restarted after the visiting Roma supporters were ordered to cease their behaviour.
Roma, who were fined 50,000 euros (£42,400) by the Italian Football League for the incident, released a statement on Monday condemning the actions of their supporters and promised to ""face this issue head-on"".

While the attack contributed to a fall in revenues in the country's important tourism sector, it has also boosted business in the private security industry.
""In a way it has [boosted business] because our clients have been concerned,"" says James Omwando, chief executive of the security firm, KK, of the new emphasis on security.
""They've taken on additional security officers, they've invested in new equipment - CCTVs and access control.""
The company's training centre on the outskirts of Nairobi is busier than ever. New recruits march for hours as they answer their instructor at the top of their voices.
Their clean-shaven heads, navy blue shorts, white socks and shoes are meant to help instil discipline.
""Even in terms of general recruitment we're now looking for a better educated, higher profile security officer who'll be able to understand what's being looked into because the challenges are many,"" says training manager Lucas Ndolo.
Ndolo, a former military intelligence officer, says even though understanding terrorism has always been part of the training, they have had to put more emphasis on it.
""We emphasise more on surveillance, detection, profiling and what security officers are looking for in the field,"" he says.
The soon-to-graduate guards are taking their lessons in a wooden classroom. A lot of the lessons taught are focused on preventing attacks.
""It is better to press the panic button when you realise that a person is gathering information, instead of you pressing the panic button when they've come to attack,"" a trainer lectures the class of about 20 trainees.
""You saw what happened at Westgate?"" he goes on, as they answer in the affirmative.
One of the first victims of the Westgate gunmen was the mall's security officer.
For security companies such as KK, one positive thing that has come out of the widely publicised attack is that they now collaborate a lot more with Kenya's security services.
""We get police officers coming here to help train our people. We've been in touch with the bomb people, the criminal investigation [and] anti-terrorism [officers] who come here to train our people,"" says Lucas Ndolo.
They also work together in conducting security operations.
That co-ordination is also beneficial to the police, who number about 80,000.
While the UN recommends a ratio of one police officer for every 400 civilians, Kenya has only half as many officers that would be required to meet that.
The Kenyan government has increased its security budget this year by 24% to $1.7bn (Â£1bn) from last year's $1.3bn. Part of that money is meant to employ 10,000 more police officers.
In the meantime, the estimated 300,000 private security officers are supplementing efforts to make civilians feel safer.
But not everyone can afford to pay for private security officers, and technology is a cheaper security solution.
""[Many people] are looking for alarms so that our vehicles can respond in the event of a problem,"" says KK's James Omwando.
The company's control centre is getting ever busier, he says, with the team monitoring phone calls and alarms going off at their clients' premises.
A government bid to buy and install CCTV cameras in Nairobi and Mombasa has been riddled in controversy and is yet to be implemented.
Most attacks have targeted the two major cities.
Walking through the streets of the capital you see security officers standing at buildings' entrances frisking people using metal detectors.
Female officers inspect women's bags and belongings while their male counterparts check the men.
But security analyst George Musamali argues that the checks are not thorough enough.
""When the item beeps, this person [should] remove what he's carrying,"" he says.
""Then if it's a dangerous weapon, you're supposed to have been given the action on what you need to do once you've identified that this person is carrying a weapon or something that is dangerous.
""You deny access, have him arrested, hand him to the police.""
He interprets the fact that there have been several attacks since security was improved to mean that the improved measures have not succeeded.
""But let's give credit to them because so far most of the cases we've seen are that these grenades are being lobbed from outside the vehicles - they're being lobbed from outside supermarkets.""
So in a way, he says, they have helped deter more attacks.
But security is still a concern for both locals and visitors.
The daring siege of the remote agricultural town of Mpeketoni, an hour's drive from Lamu island, in June reinforced fears that the government had not done enough to maintain security.
Partly as a result of that state of affairs, the country's growth projections for 2014 have been revised down by as much as 0.5% from 5.2%.

598,600,"Martin Shkreli's drug company Turing Pharmaceuticals bought the rights to 62-year old drug Daraprim and increased the price per pill from $13.50 to $750.
Turing said it will cut the price by 50% for hospitals and offer financial assistance to individuals.
However, the company will keep its list price at the new higher level.
In September Turing promised to reduce the price.
The pill costs around $1 for patients in Europe.
In statement Turing's chief commercial officer Nancy Retzlaff defended the company's move. She said that reducing the listing price would not have translated into saving for patients.
""Drug pricing is one of the most complex parts of the healthcare industry. A drug's list price is not the primary factor in determining patient affordability and access,"" Ms Retzlaff said.
Doctors though worry keeping the price so high will make it impossible for hospitals to stock the drug for the few patients who need it.
""The decision not to lower the price leaves patients in the same boat,"" said Dr Joel Gallant, medical director of special service at Southwest Care centre.
Though Turing is offering payment assistance for some patients, Dr Gallant said this could still leave patients waiting for treatment.
""Patients start the drug in the hospital, but then they need to be discharged with the drug. While they wait for patient assistance to be approved they could be re-hospitalised,"" said Dr Gallant.
The original increase sparked outrage on social media and among politicians.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called the increase ""price gouging"".
Turing's chief executive Martin Shkreli- who had been labelled the most hated man in America-fought back saying politicians did not understand Pharmaceutical pricing.
He later backed down and promised to lower the price of the drug, though never said by how much.
Mr Shkreli told ABC news in September, ""'We've agreed to lower the price of Daraprim to a point that is more affordable and is able to allow the company to make a profit, but a very small profit.""","The company that sparked an outcry by raising the price of its HIV drug in the US by 5,000% says it will cut its price for some users.",34917918,"Sure!

Following the retrial, North Wales Police investigated after the woman's name was revealed on social media.
Anyone who reports being a victim of a sex offence is guaranteed lifelong anonymity.
North Wales Police's temporary Supt Jason Devonport said the publishing of her name was a ""serious"" offence.
The men, aged between 16 and 23, were from the Sheffield, Derbyshire and Birmingham areas.
All were cautioned after admitting publishing the name of the woman - who has lifelong anonymity under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992 - after the retrial verdict.

601,603,"At least a dozen Republicans have said they will not be voting for him, since the comments emerged on Friday.
Mr Trump says he will never drop out of the race to be president and will never let his supporters down.
He has been under pressure after a tape from 2005 of him bragging about groping and kissing women was broadcast.
The latest to withdraw their support are former Republican presidential candidate John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.
Mr McCain said Mr Trump's comments ""make it impossible to continue to offer even conditional support for his candidacy"", while Ms Rice said: ""Enough! Donald Trump should not be President. He should withdraw.""
New Hampshire Senator Kelly Ayotte said in a statement: ""I cannot and will not support a candidate for president who brags about degrading and assaulting women,"" she said
Ms Ayotte - who faces a competitive race for re-election - said she would not vote for Mrs Clinton but instead would ""write in"" Mike Pence, Mr Trump's vice-presidential running mate, on her ballot paper.
Several other Republicans also said they would vote for Mr Pence.
Mr Trump himself stressed that there was ""zero chance I'll quit"", adding that he was getting ""unbelievable"" support.
And in a tweet, the Republican candidate said ""the media and establishment want me out of the race so badly"".
Mr Trump's wife Melania issued a statement on Saturday saying: ""The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me.""
She said her husband had ""the heart and mind of a leader"".
Mr Pence said he was ""offended"" by Mr Trump's video, but grateful he had expressed remorse and apologised to the American people.
""We pray for his family,"" he said in a statement.
House Speaker Paul Ryan had originally invited Mr Trump to attend a campaign event in Wisconsin this weekend but rescinded his invitation, saying he was ""sickened"" by what he had heard. Mr Pence was due to go in his running mate's place, but declined to attend.
Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump's Democratic election rival, called his comments in the tape ""horrific"".
In the recorded comments, which date back to 2005 when Mr Trump was appearing as a guest on a soap, he says ""you can do anything"" to women ""when you're a star"" and is heard saying ""grab them by the pussy"".
The candidate released a video statement apologising for the comments.
Mr Trump's 2005 comments, posted by the Washington Post, overshadowed the release of transcripts of Mrs Clinton's speeches to private events, by the whistle-blowing site Wikileaks.
The candidate had married his third wife Melania a few months before the recording. She said on Saturday: ""I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and the world.""

The second TV debate between Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton will take place on Sunday evening in St Louis.
Mr Trump recently said he would not bring up stories about Bill Clinton's infidelities in the debate, after previously threatening to do so.
But in his video apology, he attacked the former president directly:
""Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked and shamed his victims.
""We'll discuss this in the coming days,"" he said. ""See you at the debate on Sunday.""
The day after a video emerged in which he suggested he could have any woman he wants because he's a star and so could just grab them by the pussy, Mr Trump is in a whole ocean of hot political water.
Enough, quite possibly, to sink any chance he had of winning the White House.
There is a violence in the phrases ""grab 'em by the pussy"" and ""you can do anything"" that any victim of abuse would recognise and that most women would find sickening.
But this tape doesn't just offend women, judging from the reaction in the Republican party. It has offended a lot of men too. Whether those men will now withdraw their endorsements of him is yet to be seen.

604,606,"At first, it is hard to say exactly why. It is just that something doesn't feel quite right.  Ulsan feels like a place you vaguely know but can't quite figure out how.
And then it hits you. It is reminiscent of old photographs of European shipbuilding towns on rivers whose names are redolent of their history: in Britain, the Clyde, Tyne, Wear, Tees or Mersey.
In those pictures cranes and partly built ships towered over houses.  Thousands streamed from work together the moment a shift ended.
Nobody could forget how work enabled their lives because they saw, heard and smelled the place of work in every corner of the town.  It was their skyline.
That world of the heaviest of industry is no longer prominent in Europe. Even the biggest shipyards that remain (in Romania, Poland and Germany) are minnows compared to the yards of Asia.
If you look at the league table of shipbuilding companies in the world, five of the top 10, including all of the top four, are South Korean. The other five are Japanese and Chinese.
But the Hyundai Heavy Industries yard at Ulsan is the biggest of them all, giant cranes (aptly called Goliaths) dominating the skyline. The city pulsates with work and wages and the activities of far from idle hands.
The yard stretches for 2.5 miles (4km).  More than 60,000 people are employed there, constructing a huge ship every four or five days. These ships are the length of three football fields and are built in pieces each weighing hundreds of tonnes and then assembled around the clock.
In the dark, the yard glows across the town.  By day, the clang of construction rings out.  In the old European pictures and newsreels, workers would stream home on foot or maybe bicycles.  At Ulsan, they swarm out on motor scooters.
And when they are out, they drive the company car, eat in the company restaurants, laugh and cry in the company theatre, shop in the company department store, have their children in the company hospital, learn in the company schools, cheer for the company football team.
One of the longest-serving workers, Lee Sang-bok, told the BBC: ""Everything here is Hyundai. The highway I drive on is named after the founder of the company. The hospital and university is funded by Hyundai too.
""There's a town joke that it's just like the Hyundai Kingdom.""
He started work at the yard soon after it opened in 1974.
""I joined this company when I was just 16. In the past 40 years, shipbuilding really has become the centre of my life.  I devoted all my youth to this company.  It's become my identity"".
When South Korea industrialised in the 1960s and 1970s, setting in train its breathtaking transformation from poverty to affluence, it was done in a way to make Western ""free-market"" economists disapprove (though there is an argument that when the United States and Britain industrialised, they broke their own rules, too).
Government direction and government subsidy was the order of the day. South Korea's leader at the time, Gen Park Chung-hee, said ""do it"" and the corrupt rich he had jailed and threatened had no choice but to create the industries the government decreed.
It was ""directed capitalism"".
Under Park Chung-hee, scores of businessmen were arrested and charged with ""illicit profiteering"".
Property was confiscated.  Some were paraded with signs round their necks saying:  ""I am a corrupt pig.""
In return for freedom and renewed access to their money, the country's richest people were told to invest in new industries.
They had to sign an agreement stating:  ""I will donate all my property when the government requires it for the construction of the nation.""
Initially, the plan focused on six key industries (cement, synthetic fibre, electricity, fertiliser, oil refining and iron and steel), but in the early 1970s it turned to shipbuilding.
And this is where construction magnate Chung Ju Yung came in.
It should be said that he was not in that first wave of corrupt business leaders.  He earned his money the hard way, born a peasant who left home to labour on building sites and then to form his own construction company.
With the Korean War, he thrived.
Initially, he made cars in Ulsan but then turned to shipbuilding.  He was supremely ambitious and supremely confident - legend has it that he toured London seeking finance and when it was pointed out that South Korea had no shipbuilding industry, he took out a Korean bank note on which was a famous ship from the 16th Century.
He was also supremely careful with money.  In the company museum at the Ulsan shipyard, there are two pairs of shoes which Mr Chung is said to have worn for 30 years, getting them constantly repaired despite being a multi-billionaire.

His parsimony has paid off.  It used to be said that Asian manufacturers competed with Europeans and North Americans on price but not on quality.
That is no longer so. The Ulsan yard is a builder of sophisticated vessels into which goes a lot of top research.
Metal gets bashed but lab mice get pushed, too.  It is heavy industry in which research and the latest technology is incorporated.
Lee Sang-bok is now an inspector at the yard.  His role is important.
Some of the vessels built there are carriers of liquefied natural gas.  Inside these ships go huge containers.  A leak of LNG would be catastrophic, igniting a huge explosion, so welds have to be inspected in microscopic detail.  This is what Mr Lee does.
It is a working life that has lasted 40 years.  It has given him and his family prosperity and pride.","To a European visitor, the city of Ulsan on the southern tip of the Korean peninsula seems like a throwback to some lost world.",32811866,"The Hyundai Heavy Industries shipyard in Ulsan, South Korea is one of the largest and most advanced in the world, employing over 60,000 people and constructing massive ships every few days, with a long history of government direction and subsidy that has enabled its growth and dominance in the industry.",0,"Article: {}

She left her grandmother's house in Coatbridge on 23 February 1957 to go to the shops but never returned.
Convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore is suspected of her murder.
Det Supt Pat Campbell said: ""There are five distinct areas which have been identified which relate to items or structures within the silt layer.
""We are going to deploy divers from Police Scotland to remove these objects.""
He said specialists from the University of Dundee would then identify the objects and determine whether any of them are bones.
The first phase of the operation last week focused on a 170m (185 yards) stretch of canal at Carnbroe. Although it is 3.5m (11.5ft) deep, around 2m (6.5ft) of that is silt.
The team were joined by leading experts including soil forensic expert Prof Lorna Dawson and forensic anthropologist Prof Sue Black.
The search involved the use of ground-penetrating radar, sonar scanning and magnetometry, which identifies magnetic anomalies within the water and silt layer of the canal.
Bus driver and convicted paedophile Alexander Gartshore, who died in 2006, is suspected of murdering Moira and disposing of her body.
When she left her grandmother's house during a heavy snowstorm, she boarded a Baxter's bus that was driven by Gartshore.
Later that year, he was jailed for raping a 17-year-old babysitter.
In 1999, convicted child abuser James Gallogley named his former friend Gartshore as Moira's murderer.
Gartshore's own daughter Sandra Brown was convinced he was the killer and campaigned to have him charged.
In 2014, prosecutors announced that Gartshore would have faced prosecution for the schoolgirl's murder if he were still alive.
A previous search has focused on the theory that he may have buried her body in Monkland Cemetery, in the family plot of an acquaintance, but an excavation in 2013 found nothing.

Defender Joe Shaughnessy headed home Liam Craig's corner to level but Trakai responded with a stunning long-range strike from Vaidotas Silenas.
Craig and Graham Cummins wasted chances as Saints failed to find an equaliser.
Trakai finished with 10 men as Silenas picked up a second yellow card with eight minutes left, but the visitors held on.
St Johnstone made a positive start but Trakai carved out the first opening in the seventh minute. A cross found Aliaksandr Bychanok, but his diving header went wide.
The Lithuanian side looked technically accomplished with 18-year-old Liberian Dorley causing Saints plenty of problems, and the visitors took the lead with a fine move in the 14th minute. A low cross into the box found Maksimov, who fired smartly past Zander Clark.
The hosts should have equalised when Blair Alston broke through the centre of the FK Trakai defence but he fired straight at the keeper. The rebound fell to Cummins, who had his first shot blocked before blazing his second over the bar.
Richard Foster's shot was diverted wide by Arunas Klimavicius, and from the resultant corner St Johnstone equalised, Shaughnessy heading home from close range into the corner.
But the joy for the home fans was short-lived as FK Trakai took the lead for a second time. A fantastic strike from Silenas from range flashed past Clark. The noise levels inside McDiarmid Park dipped once more.
At the start of the second half Dorley played in Alma Wakili down the left hand side but he fired his shot well wide of the post.
Saints manager Tommy Wright brought on new signing Stefan Scougall in the hope of improving the levels of creativity from the home side.
His ball from the flank presented Craig with a great chance to equalise, but the midfielder volleyed his shot high over the crossbar.
Then an even better chance. From a poor Saints corner the ball fell fortuitously to the feet of Scougall. He lashed in a low shot which beat the keeper, but struck the post.
FK Trakai remained a danger, Clark saving well from Maksimov, but St Johnstone had further opportunities.
Alston burst through from midfield and engineered a chance at the edge of the box, but his shot was deflected wide.
From the resultant corner Saints had the ball in the net from another Shaughnessy header, but the referee blew his whistle for a foul on the keeper.
Silenas was sent off for a second bookable offence, but the home side could not capitalise.
Alston again created an opening and as the ball flashed across goal, it fell straight to Cummins, but from five yards out the striker's shot was too close to Trakai keeper Ignas Plukas, who blocked the ball with his trailing foot.
St Johnstone boss Tommy Wright: ""Obviously, the result is disappointing. The second goal is criminal from us. It was a great finish but the ball should never get to him.

617,619,"It was a ruling in a case brought by two women who wanted to wear the niqab veil, which covers all but the eyes.
Belgium banned the wearing of partial or total face veils in public in 2011.
The court agreed that the ban sought to guarantee the concept of ""living together"" and the ""protection of the rights and freedoms of others"".
The court came to a similar judgement on Tuesday in the case of a Belgian woman who was contesting a bylaw brought in by three Belgian municipalities in 2008 that also banned face veils.
The European Court of Human Rights is an international court set up in 1959 and rules on individual or state applications alleging violations of the civil and political rights set out in the European Convention on Human Rights.
Belgian MPs approved the ban in 2011 on the grounds of security, to allow police to identify people, although some also argued the veil was a symbol of the oppression of women.
The latest case brought against Belgium was filed by Belgian national Samia Belcacemi, who lives in Schaerbeek, and Moroccan national Yamina Oussar, who lives in LiÃ¨ge.
Ms Belcacemi removed her veil fearing she might be fined or jailed, while Ms Oussar opted to stay at home, curtailing her social life, the court noted.
In its ruling, the court took into consideration a previous ruling it had made in a similar case brought against France over its imposition of a veil ban.
It noted: ""The court found that the concern to ensure respect for the minimum guarantees of life in society could be regarded as an element of the 'protection of the rights and freedoms of others' and that the ban was justifiable in principle, solely to the extent that it sought to guarantee the conditions of 'living together'.""
In the second case, the court made a similar ruling against the application brought by Belgian national Fouzia Dakir against the ban imposed by the municipalities of Pepinster, Dison and Verviers in 2008.
An appeal against the rulings can be lodged with the Grand Chamber of the court within three months.
In March, Europe's top court, the European Court of Justice (ECJ), ruled that workplace bans on the wearing of ""any political, philosophical or religious sign"" such as headscarves need not constitute direct discrimination.

""The last three weeks has seen all Scotland's councils willing to support a coordinated response to what can only be described as a humanitarian crisis.
""For many councils that has seen them committing to taking refugees immediately.""
Glasgow City Council was one of a small number of councils across the UK that had already taken in Syrian refugees, with more than a quarter of refugees that have arrived in the UK through the scheme being housed there.
Cosla said Scotland's local authorities had an excellent track record in supporting the most vulnerable in society and already had effective systems and partnerships in place which makes them well placed to host Syrian refugees in their communities.
But it said it recognised the scale of the task and the need for detailed planning.
Cosla spokesman Harry McGuigan said: ""We fully recognise that this is not simply about matching people to houses, and that we must meet the wider needs of people so that they can integrate into our communities and build a safe life in Scotland.
""The response to this crisis will therefore be focused on balancing the urgency of the situation with planning the most appropriate ways in which councils and their community planning partners receive and integrate these extremely vulnerable people.""
Cosla called on the Home Office and the Scottish government to ensure the programme is fully resourced so that local authorities and partners in areas such as health, the police and the voluntary sector could put appropriate services in place to meet the needs of refugees.","Syrian refugees are likely to have arrived in many areas of Scotland by Christmas, local authority body Cosla has said.",34418496,"All 32 local authorities in Scotland have agreed to support a coordinated response to the humanitarian crisis of Syrian refugees, with at least 18 councils set to receive the first groups of people before Christmas, and the Scottish government has pledged to accept at least 2,000 of the 20,000 refugees the UK government has agreed to take.",0,"Article: {}

The 34-year-old, who won 10,000m gold eight days ago, was swamped by his rivals in the final lap and Ethiopia's Muktar Edris broke clear to win gold.
Britain's Farah kicked again to take silver at the London Stadium in his final major track championships.
Britain's men won a stunning 4x100m relay gold as the women took silver.
""It's been a long journey but it's been incredible,"" Farah told BBC Sport.
""It didn't quite hit home until after I crossed the line and had a couple of moments to myself when I realised - this is it.
""I gave it all - I didn't have a single bit left at the end.""
Four-time Olympic champion Farah will finish his track career with a record of 10 golds and two silvers in major championships.
He is set to focus on marathons after his final track appearance at the 5,000m Diamond League final in Zurich on 24 August.
Gold and silver in the two 4x100m relays takes Britain's medal tally at London 2017 to four - Farah supplying the other two - but the hosts are still two short of UK Sport's target of six to eight.
Edris, 23, ran a superbly judged final 600m to claim his first major title with a sprint finish reminiscent of so many Farah triumphs.
After a brief burst from Farah's compatriot Andrew Butchart at the front of the race, the Ethiopian trio of Edris, Yomif Kejelcha and Selemon Barega moved up to box in the home favourite.
Barega fell back but Edris used Kejelcha as a pace-setter into the home straight before surging away while Farah battled for position with the resurgent Paul Chelimo behind.
Farah finally found open track but Edris was gone, with the Briton passing the fading Kejelcha and holding off Chelimo to salvage silver.
""The 10,000m took a lot more out of me than I realised,"" said Farah.
""I was trying to cover every move but they had a game plan - one of them was going to sacrifice himself and that's what they did and the better man won.""
Farah has now lost just two of his 22 5,000m contests since 2011.
""I was highly prepared for this race and I knew I was going to beat Mo Farah,"" said Edris, who won in a time of 13 minutes 32.79 seconds to claim his first win over the Briton in five attempts.
""I am the new champion for Ethiopia, that's why I did the 'Mobot' [Farah's traditional celebration] - I am the next champion.""
1976 Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist and BBC commentator Brendan Foster: ""We did say fatigue was going to get him. It has to come to an end. He hates losing.""
BBC athletics expert Allison Curbishley: ""In my head and my heart I didn't think anyone could genuinely beat Mo Farah but that 10,000m at the start of the week took so much out of him. Edris, we take our hat off to you. This man has beaten the legend that is Mo Farah in his own back yard.""
2005 marathon world champion Paul Radcliffe: ""He just doesn't have the pace in his legs anymore to be able to live with challengers like that but this isn't the end of Mo Farah in athletics. He has a new challenge ahead of him in the marathon.""
Two-time Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson: ""He has got to be hurting. But it has to end for everybody. In a couple of weeks or months, he will look back and say, 'that was awesome'.""
2004 Olympic 4x100m relay champion Darren Campbell: ""There are athletes out there who have won more medals, but the quality of those medals and for Mo to have led an event on his own... wow. I don't know how you can't see him as our greatest ever athlete.""

A disconsolate Farah dropped to the track as Edris mimicked his famous celebration, before finally picking himself up to complete a farewell lap.
Farah has come under scrutiny in recent years, with his coach Alberto Salazar under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.
The Briton also recently denied any wrongdoing after computer hackers revealed some of his blood samples had initially been flagged as suspicious, before later being declared normal.
After initial shock at the result, the crowd found their voice to give Farah a final warm send-off at the stadium he lit up with double Olympic gold in 2012.
""Back in 2008 at the Olympics I was so disappointed [at not making the 5,000m final] and I didn't know what to do with myself, whether to carry on with the sport,"" said Farah.
""I had to decide what it took to become a champion and that was to move to the other side of the world - nothing was guaranteed but I took that chance.
""This London crowd is amazing - there is no place like home.
""I have a few more races on the track, then I will take a short break and then this chapter of my life is closed.""
Elsewhere, Britons Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Morgan Lake finished fifth and sixth respectively in the high jump as Maria Lasitskene - the Russian competing as a neutral athlete - won gold with a leap of 2.03m.
And Ashley Bryant finished 11th in the men's decathlon, with Kevin Mayer becoming the first French world champion in the event.

But the Owls took the lead shortly after the break, Wallace smashing into the top corner from 30 yards out.
Town's Jack Payne was shown a straight red card, before Fernando Forestieri tapped in for Wednesday late on.
Moments earlier striker Sam Winnall, who joined the Owls from Barnsley on Friday, had been denied a debut goal by Terriers goalkeeper Danny Ward.
But Callum McManaman rounded the on-loan Liverpool player, before Forestieri flicked his effort into the net to extend the Owls' winning run against Huddersfield to four consecutive league games.
Carlos Carvalhal's side are now sixth in the table, just one point behind Town and five clear of seventh-placed Derby.
Huddersfield remain level on points with fourth-placed Reading, having seen an eight-match unbeaten run in all competitions come to an end.
Sheffield Wednesday head coach Carlos Carvalhal:
""It was an amazing goal from Wallace, a typical Ross Wallace goal. He deserved this goal. We gave him permission to fly and he flew to a fantastic goal.
""I didn't see the red card, I was too far away. I think Forestieri should have been given a penalty though.
""Winnall really affected the game, he's a good player and made a big impact, just like McManaman. When we win, we win together.
""I am very happy with the fans today. We felt they were with us even when the first half wasn't going our way.""
Huddersfield head coach David Wagner:
""We were more dangerous in the first half but we were not clinical enough today. You have to use your opportunities.
""Three big decisions went against us; Nahki Wells was fouled in the build-up to the first goal, the red card was harsh and Forestieri might have been offside for the second goal.
""I think we shouldn't forget where we are today, against one of the best teams in the division.

The Republican who has won a string of primary contests has blamed the supporters of Democrat Bernie Sanders and denied responsibility for the violence. On Sunday, he said his campaign is ""not provoking"" and ""wants peace"".
He said no one gets hurt at his ""love-fest"" rallies.
A Quinnipiac University poll shows that Mr Trump is leading the way in Florida and tied with Ohio Governor John Kasich in Ohio ahead of crucial state primaries on Tuesday.
Here's what people are saying about Mr Trump and the violence at his rallies:
What Trump says about protesters at his rallies
Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders: Called Mr Trump a ""pathological liar"" after he said he had sent protesters to disrupt his rallies.
Florida Senator Marco Rubio: Said it is ""harder every day to justify"" backing Mr Trump should he win the Republican nomination and said conservatism is not about ""how angry can you get, how offensive you can be, how loud you can speak"".
Ohio Governor John Kasich: Asked his staff to make a list of Mr Trump's quotes promoting violence at his rallies and that Mr Trump's ""toxic"" tone makes it even more important for him to win his home state in the primary election on Tuesday.
Senator Ted Cruz: Said that the culture of violence is Mr Trump's fault, telling reporters that ""any candidate is responsible for the culture of the campaign"".
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio: Tweeted that there is no question Mr Trump a racist.
Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton: Said Mr Trump's campaign consists of ""hate"" and ""fear"".
President Barack Obama:  Said over the weekend: ""Our leaders - those who aspire to be our leaders - should be trying to bring us together and not turning us against one another and speak out against violence and reject efforts to spread fear or turn us against one another. And if they refuse to do that, they don't deserve our support.""
House Speaker Paul Ryan: Said the violence at Mr Trump's rallies is ""very concerning"" and that candidates must take ""responsibility for the environment"" at their events
Neurosurgeon Ben Carson, former Republican candidate: Told NBC's Today programme that the violence could get worse, placing blame on the protesters, saying ""I think certainly if the protesters continue with their... tactics, there is a real possibility of escalation"".
Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee: Defended Mr Trump, condemning the Chicago protesters. ""I think it's ridiculous to blame Trump for a bunch of thugs out on the street,"" he told the Huffington Post.

632,634,"SuperTed was born in south Wales as a book, before becoming a much-loved TV series on both sides of the Atlantic.
It was shown as one of Welsh language broadcaster S4C's first programmes in November 1982, before being translated into English and shown on BBC One the following year.
Barry-born Young, now 70, has spent most of his working life in animation in California, working as an independent in Hollywood dominated by the big studios.
The former advertising copywriter has now produced a feature-length animation, Norm Of The North, and his next film project is close to his heart - about a former legend with his beloved Cardiff City football club.
A BEAR BEGINNING
In 1978, Young created SuperTed as a story to read to his young stepson Richard, who was afraid of the dark, at bedtime.
But the tales of the crime-solving superhero with special powers - and rivals like Texas Pete - soon got a wider audience.
""I went to the village hall one day to pick Richard up from play school and they said 'we love the SuperTed stories' and I said 'how do you know about those?'
""They said that 'he always tells us the story you told him last night'.
""We then got the books published, a couple of hundred were written, and then S4C came along and they wanted at least one thing which would travel all over the world - and it was successful.
""We became the first company to sell to Disney and we never looked back.""
Three TV series were made in the mid 1980s, with Derek Griffiths and Jon Pertwee providing the voices.
Young also launched Welsh-language cartoon Wil Cwac Cwac and helped develop Fireman Sam.
Now a new series of SuperTed is being planned, which Young again wants to make in Wales with some of the original team.
HOLLYWOOD BECKONS
Young and his wife Liz created Mike Young Productions - which later become Splash Entertainment - and moved to Los Angeles in 1989.
With much bigger rivals in Hollywood, he called it ""one of the most stupid, crazy decisions you could make"". But the company flourished.
As well as collaborations, its animations have included Chloe's Closet, Dive Olly Dive!, Hero:108, Growing Up Creepie, Pet Alien and ToddWorld.
NORM OF THE NORTH
Young's latest production is an animated feature film Norm Of the North about a polar bear.
Norm, who can talk but cannot hunt, goes to New York with a gang of lemmings for adventure and to fight a tourism development in the Arctic.
Although it does not have a big budget, the film uses the latest computer generated imagery (CGI) technology.
""We wanted to make something economic because I want the independents to have a chance and really get back into this business,"" said Young.
""It's all well and good having Disney, Pixar, Universal and DreamWorks but fundamentally they go a certain route but we can take more risks with what we do.""
The film, which includes voices from actors Rob Schneider and Bill Nighy, got its Welsh premiere at the Market Hall cinema in Brynmawr, Blaenau Gwent, earlier this week.
CARDIFF CITY FAN IS THE RIGHT MATCH
He may live in California, but Cardiff City fan Young is now on the team making a film about one of the Bluebirds' most colourful characters.
Friday (The Greatest Player You Never Saw) is about the late Robin Friday, who played for Cardiff and Reading in the 1980s before he died aged 38.
""He made George Best look like an angel,"" Young said.

636,638,"Two separate US teams have found success with an approach that homes in on a stable part of the flu virus.
That should remove the problem with current flu vaccines which must be given anew each year because they focus on the mutating part of the virus.
The proof-of-concept work is published in Science journal and Nature Medicine.
Studies are now needed in humans to confirm that the method will work in man.
In the meantime, experts say people should continue to receive an annual flu jab because vaccination is still the best way to protect yourself against infection.
Conventional flu jabs target molecules on the surface of the flu virus, but these are constantly changing.
Imagine the flu virus as a ball with lots of lollipops on stems sticking out.
The lollipops change year to year, but the stems remain the same.
It is the stems that scientists are now focusing on as a target for a universal flu jab.
Many different research teams have been testing potential candidates, but it has been a technical challenge to make something that can be used in a vaccine without involving the  lollipop 'head' of the hemagglutinin molecule.
This latest work seems particularly promising, according to Prof John Oxford, a flu expert at the University of London.
He called the results a ""red letter day"" for science.
""This is a leap forward compared to anything done recently. They have good animal data, not just in mice but in ferrets and monkeys too. And they've done it with the bird flu virus H5N1,"" he said.
""It's a very good stepping stone. Ultimately, the hope is to get a vaccine that will cover a pandemic virus.""
Prof Sarah Gilbert, Professor of Vaccinology at University of Oxford, said: ""This is an exciting development, but the new vaccines now need to be tested in clinical trials to see how well they work in humans.""
""This will be the next stage of research, which will take several years. So we are still some way from having better flu vaccines for humans,"" she added.","Researchers say they are closer to developing a vaccine to give life-long protection against any type of flu, after promising trials in animals.",34038808,"Two US research teams have made a breakthrough in developing a universal flu vaccine that targets a stable part of the virus, potentially removing the need for annual vaccinations, but further clinical trials are needed to confirm its effectiveness in humans.",0,"Article: {}

Outside, traditional Japanese plants and water features make it feel more like Japan than Northern Ireland.
Set up nearly two decades ago, in 1996, the group was formed to help Japanese people new to Northern Ireland to integrate, but its members say the society is about much more than that too.
On Saturday, the society held its first meeting of the year.
The society's secretary, Séan Greer, said many members joined because they had lived in Japan for a time.
""I used to live in Japan, for about nine years in total, and I came back just at the end of 2003,"" he said.
""I wanted to keep my contact with Japan, I heard about the society and looked them up. People are interested in Japanese culture for a lot of different reasons.
""It might be the language, for a lot of people it's food, for a lot of younger people it's the animation and manga (Japanese cartoons). Everything they do seems to be a little bit different or sometimes very different from our own and therefore it's sort of endlessly fascinating.""
There was plenty of culture on show at the meeting, including a performance by a group of Japanese taiko drummers from Londonderry.
One of the group's founders, Fiona Umetsu, said it was an exciting art form, mixing both music and performance.
""Taiko is a part of nearly every Japanese festival that you see, and it's a brilliant part of their summer,"" she said.

Séan Greer said the society also allows Japanese visitors to find out how the western world views their culture.
""If you got to Japan the first question a Japanese person will ask you is:  ""あなたは、日本どう思いますか"", which means, 'what do you think of Japan?' and they're really curious about what others think of them,"" he said.

640,642,"A BBC analysis suggests 195 out of 402 official bathing waters are patrolled between July and September.
The National Water Safety Forum said it was ""impractical"" for every beach to be covered.
The absence of lifeguards was raised as a concern after the deaths of seven men at Camber Sands in 2016 but an inquest concluded they may have drowned anyway.
There is no formal list of which beaches have lifeguards as the Royal National Lifeboat Institute (RNLI) only publishes details of the ones it patrols. Local councils and private land owners provide others.
Seven people died in two incidents at Camber Sands in East Sussex in summer 2016.
The families of five men, who died in the second incident in August, described the victims as physically fit and competent swimmers.
An inquest into the deaths, which concluded in June 2017, heard the RNLI had recommended that Rother District Council employ lifeguards after a risk assessment in 2013.
The inquest was also told the RNLI then rejected a request to put lifeguards on Camber Sands 16 days before the August deaths, citing a lack of resources.
Lifeguards now patrol the beach. However, the inquest concluded that the men may still have drowned even if there had been lifeguards.

RNLI lifeguards rescued 2,082 people across the UK and Jersey, and saved 127 lives, in 2016.
The charity, which lists the beaches it patrols on its website, said it worked with councils and other beach owners to determine lifeguard cover.
""There may be times when we will approach a local authority or beach owner if there has been something that has happened on that beach, but the majority of times it will be due to the local authority or beach owner coming to us"", a spokeswoman said.
The RNLI said it would not be possible to put lifeguards on to all bathing waters and services ""need to be judged on a needs basis as opposed to a cost implication"".
The cost to train a RNLI lifeguard is Â£712 plus a further Â£812 for equipment.
The water safety forum said some of the beaches not covered by lifeguards may not attract significant numbers of people or pose a significant risk.
""Water-related accidents occur on inland waters as well - it's very important that this is not forgotten,"" a spokeswoman said.
Seeing children swimming and jumping off rocks into the sea, Alexa Mullane was concerned that there were no lifeguards at Durdle Door beach in Dorset.
The managing director of a health supplements company visited the beach, as well as Lulworth Cove and Studland with her family, including two baby nieces - during the good weather in June.
She saw ""lots of kids swimming quite far out and also jumping off really high rocks into the sea"".
""I definitely thought that it wasn't safe,"" Ms Mullane said. ""You could see the rocks under the water and it was scary to see them jumping from so high into the water.""
James Weld, whose family owns Lulworth Estate which owns Durdle Door, responded: ""The signage makes it very clear that people should not jump or 'tombstone' from Durdle Door because of the serious risk of injury.
""Like many beaches in the UK we do not have lifeguards on duty, our coastal safety signs clearly advise all visitors of this fact.
Mr Weld added that beach wardens and rangers, who are not trained lifeguards or first-aiders, patrol Lulworth Estate's beaches regularly.
BBC England's data unit analysed a list of beaches patrolled by lifeguards, RNLI and otherwise, using data provided by the RNLI, the Beach Guide and local councils' websites, as of 7 July 2017.
The list was compared to the Department of Environment Food and Rural Affairs' list of designated bathing waters in England, with inland waters - such as Lake Windermere and Hampstead Heath in London - stripped out.

643,645,"Edward Alexander Lee, 34, was sentenced to three years on probation at Belfast Crown Court on Wednesday.
Judge Gordon Kerr QC said it was the best way of protecting society and helping Lee to change his ways.
Lee, originally from Whitehall Square, Belfast, but now living in England, pleaded guilty to a total of 15 charges related to child pornography.
The court was told the vast majority of the images were in the lowest categories, although some were in the higher - more serious - categories.
Lee was described by his wife as a being ""loving and normal young man"".
Judge Kerr said that while he had viewed the images for his ""own strange pleasure"", they were serious matters as ""children were abused for these images to be made"".
He added that children would continue to be abused while people like Lee continued to view such material, and that ""society would not tolerate such behaviour"".
Judge Kerr said a sentence of up to a year in prison would do very little to assist Lee or the community.
Placing him on probation, he ordered him to complete a course on sexual offending to help him stop viewing such images.
Earlier, prosecutor Simon Jenkins said that when police went to Lee's then Belfast home on 5 June, 2014, he immediately confirmed he was the man they were looking for.
On computer equipment seized, police uncovered a number of folders, which Lee admitted creating.
During interview, Lee said that he had been downloading images ""for perhaps the last nine years"".

George Osborne's stated aim was to create what he called a ""new settlement"". That's politician's code for re-writing the rules of politics to suit your side.
So it is that he did something rather surprising - slowing and softening spending and welfare cuts now having promised faster and deeper cuts in the run up to the election.
So it is that he adopted a series of Labour policies - a higher re-badged minimum wage, a levy on firms to pay for apprentices, an assault on the tax privilege of so-called non doms.
This in addition to delivering Tory promises to cut income tax, corporation tax and inheritance tax.
But hold on - below those headlines are some potentially eye-watering cuts to benefits - the cuts to tax credits for families will dwarf the pay rise many will get.

A spokesman added: ""Safety is our priority and we are managing a very complex site which has got a great deal of hazardous radioactive materials on it.""
The Isle of Man is located about 34 miles (55km) from the nuclear fuel reprocessing plant.
Due to its potential impact on the Manx fishing industry, the Manx government began monitoring radioactivity levels in the Irish Sea in 1989.

The BBC investigation was prompted by a whistle-blower - a former senior manager who was worried by conditions at the plant.
He said his biggest fear was a fire in one of the nuclear waste silos or in one of the processing plants.
The Manx government said it was particularly concerned about ""the structural integrity of ageing waste storage ponds and silos"".

""The majority of the fans probably want me out. What I would like to have here is a lot more time.""
Gillingham have only won three of their 16 league games this season and are currently two points from safety.
Taylor led the club to 17th place in League One last season after taking charge in October, initially as interim manager, and subsequently targeted a mid-table finish this season.
The 61-year-old received the backing of Scally last month but accepts that it is hard for supporters to show patience while they are struggling.
""I understand the fans' frustrations. We were all expecting a better season than we are having,"" he said. ""We are in a bit of a hole and need to dig ourselves out of it.
""I really do feel that there is a good squad here but we are not showing it at the moment. I would love longer.

He said the move was ""apparently"" in response to him saying the party's current leadership ""couldn't knock the skin off a rice pudding"".
But a spokesman said his membership had lapsed earlier this year.
And party leader Paul Nuttall said the businessman - who has suggested he should be made party chairman to shake up the party's policymaking and campaigning - was causing ""negative and damaging publicity"".
In a letter to Mr Banks, Mr Nuttall said the party's ruling NEC had agreed to meet the businessman later this month to discuss his ideas but this invitation could be withdrawn if he continued to criticise UKIP and its leadership.
He added: ""I should make clear that, whilst I am open to working with you on improving and enhancing our party, the party chairmanship is not on offer.""
Mr Banks, who gave Â£1m to the party ahead of the 2015 general election, has been sceptical about the leadership of Paul Nuttall and has recently spoken of founding a new political movement to ""drain the swamp"" of Westminster politics.
He also suggested he could stand against Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only MP, by using a recall petition to trigger a by-election in his Clacton constituency.
But Mr Carswell played down the importance of Mr Banks' announcement, telling the BBC: ""It's always very sad when one of UKIP's 40,000 members leaves the party for whatever reason.""
Referencing previous claims that he had prevented former UKIP leader Nigel Farage from being knighted, Mr Carswell added: ""I have no more say in NEC decisions at UKIP than I do in who gets a knighthood.""
On Mr Banks' suggestion that he could stand against Mr Carswell in Clacton at the next general election, the MP said: ""Each time I've stood there've been some wonderfully colourful characters on the ballot paper.
""I even had a chap who changed his name by deed poll to Lord Ha Ha Woof Woof. I'm sure at the next election there'll be some colourful characters too - the more the merrier.""

Atletico made the brighter start so it was no real surprise when they went ahead in the 24th minute.
They squandered possession 25 yards from goal and Griezmann let fly with a low shot that crept inside the near post with home goalkeeper Alves slow to react.
The lead lasted just four minutes, however, before Valencia scored as a long pass was cushioned by the head of Paco Alcacer to Cheryshev, who lashed home a left-footed drive from 15 yards.
Cheryshev lifted a shot over the crossbar from another Alcacer header seven minutes before half-time as Valencia grew in confidence.
Alcacer had a chance to put Valencia ahead just before the hour mark when he latched onto a pass by Sofiane Feghouli but fired straight at goalkeeper Jan Oblak.
Moments later Alves made up for his earlier error with a fantastic, one-handed save to keep out a powerful effort by Luciano Vietto.
But the keeper could do nothing to stop substitute Torres, who was making his 300th Atletico appearance, putting his side ahead with 18 minutes remaining as he slid in at the far post to turn the ball home after Jose Maria Gimenez flicked on a corner.

His deception was uncovered when solicitors went to interview him three days later, only to find him gone.
Moore, 28, from Ilford, east London, handed himself in three days later.
Southwark Crown Court heard he had set up a fake web domain which closely resembled that of the court service's official address.
He then emailed the prison's custody inbox with instructions for his release.
The court heard Moore registered the bogus website in the name of investigating officer Det Insp Chris Soole, giving the address and contact details for the Royal Courts of Justice.
Prosecutor Ian Paton said: ""A lot of criminal ingenuity harbours in the mind of Mr Moore. The case is one of extraordinary criminal inventiveness, deviousness and creativity, all apparently the developed expertise of this defendant"".

654,656,"Harper Lee's classic was published 50 years ago this summer and it remains the only novel she ever wrote.
Lee, 84, has never explained why she stopped writing.
She doesn't give interviews - ""Hell, no"" was her response to a request several decades ago - and that silence has only added to the intrigue.
But her close friend Thomas Lane Butts, a retired minister in her hometown, Monroeville, Alabama, says she once told him the reason.
Sitting on a pew in the Methodist church which the Lee family still attends, he described to me how she suddenly brought the subject up one night over dinner in New York.
""She asked me, 'You ever wonder why I didn't write anything else?' And I said, 'Along with several million other people, yes, I had wondered about that.' And she said, 'Well, what do you think?'""
Speaking in his slow southern drawl, the Rev Butts, who just turned 80, suggested to her that she had already written a great book and therefore didn't need to compete with herself.
""And when I got through she said, 'You're all wrong.' I said, 'Alright, smart Alec. You tell me.' She said, 'I would not go through all the deprivation of privacy through which I went for this book again for any amount of money.'
""And she said, 'I did not need to write another book. I said what I wanted to say in that book.'""
Harper Lee called it a simple tale about the ""conflict of the human soul"" and Monroeville, Alabama, is where she drew her inspiration.
The story depicts the segregated South of her childhood, during the Depression. It was published at the height of the civil rights struggle.
The Rev Butts grew up 10 miles outside Monroeville. By the late 1950s, he says, he was a ""fuzzy-cheeked young preacher"" campaigning for an end to segregation.
He had met Martin Luther King Jr and signed a petition to boycott buses. The Ku Klux Klan had left a burning cross on his front lawn.
He says To Kill a Mockingbird was not well received in Monroeville when it was published.
""The people who were hard racist did not like it because of the implication of the book,"" the Rev Butts told me.
""The book revealed racism and that always frightens a racist - when you pull the cover off them.
""Those of us who stood up for civil rights were much encouraged by the book because in a very skilful and subtle way it addressed itself for justice.""
But these days, the Rev Butts says, there is enormous civic pride in Monroeville.
The old courthouse, which Hollywood re-created for the film, now houses a museum to Harper Lee and the town's other literary icon, Truman Capote.
Capote was a childhood friend of hers and is thought to be the inspiration for the Dill character in To Kill a Mockingbird.
The town's residents often try to protect Lee, allowing her to live a normal life instead of being hounded by fans or bothered with prying questions.
""Being famous I'm sure is a lot of fun for a year or two. But after a while it gets old,"" the Rev Butts says. ""She is not a recluse but she does hide from publicity.""","It's one of the best loved books in American literature, but To Kill a Mockingbird was also a one-hit wonder.",10355908,"Sure!

Her lawyers have pleaded not guilty on her behalf, and when her trial began she said only that she would ""leave everything"" to her defence team.
But in court, asked if she killed her husband, she said there was ""no mistake"", the Mainichi reported.
The 70-year-old said she committed the crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she obtained the cyanide from a business associate.
""I wasn't given any money after I married him,"" the Japan Times quoted Ms Kakehi as telling the court on Monday. ""I have no intention of hiding the guilt. I will laugh it off and die if I am sentenced to death tomorrow.""
Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide.
The investigation began when Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married.
A post mortem examination subsequently found traces of cyanide in his body, and investigators then began examining the deaths of other men linked to the pensioner.
She is now on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend who later died of cancer.
The men were all aged between 70 and 80 when the alleged crimes took place between 2007-2013.
Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths.
Lawyers for Ms Kakehi say her testimony cannot be trusted, because she has mild dementia.
""Since she is suffering from dementia, she barely remembers things that happened recently let alone the incidents,"" her team was quoted as saying at the start of the trial, which is expected to continue until November.
Japanese press have dubbed Ms Kakehi a ""black widow"" - a term derived from the female spider that eats its partner after mating.

A number of Labour MPs have warned about the impact of Mr Corbyn winning the leadership.

Ms Kendall indicated she may be willing to join the Labour for the Common Good group, which also includes Chuka Umunna and Tristram Hunt, and is seen as a potential resistance faction against a Corbyn leadership.
Praising the group, she said: ""It's a great idea. If I'm invited I would certainly go along.""
Mr Burnham has previously said he would serve in a Cabinet led by Mr Corbyn.
Speaking to BBC Radio 4's the World at One, Ms Cooper said Mr Corbyn had ""not shown any ability"" to be part of a team, pointing to his decision to vote against the party whip on hundreds of occasions.
Asked if she was worried if the party could split if he wins, she said: ""I am, because I'm worried what's happening at the moment, that the party does seem to be polarising between the different extremes and I don't think that is the right thing to do.
""Partly, we want to hold our party together in order to win. Divided parties don't win, but it's actually much more than that. I just don't think the extremes of the party are the right place to be and are true to our values and are true to the things we need to do to change the country for the future.""
Ms Cooper said it was ""very unlikely"" she would serve in the shadow cabinet under Mr Corbyn.
She said she would find it ""really hard"" to do so ""unless he completely changes his views on some big things which doesn't look very likely at the moment.""
Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, pledged to use the backing of party members to force Labour MPs to support his agenda if he is elected leader.
Speaking to the Independent newspaper, he said he would ""absolutely"" use support from the membership ""to push our agenda up to the parliamentary party and get them to follow that.""

The Spaniard became the only man to win three times so far this season.
He drove a controlled race and stayed just far enough ahead of his pursuers to maintain the lead.
Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end
Button climbed up from sixth on the grid to pass Vettel at the second pit stops but was re-passed with two laps to go.
However, the Englishman was promoted to second place after race stewards gave Vettel a 20-second penalty for his overtake of Button on the penultimate lap.
Lewis Hamilton retired with gearbox damage after running well down the field following an early puncture. But he will not incur any penalty for a gearbox change because of his retirement.
The result extends Alonso's championship lead to 34 points ahead of Red Bull's Mark Webber who had a low-key race to eighth place, never showing any real pace.
Alonso said: ""It was tough, not an easy race. Maybe we were not the quickest in dry conditions but we were competitive and it was enough to maintain the lead.
""Great strategy calls from the team to keep me ahead through the pit stops. I knew it would be a long race to the end, with Jenson putting pressure.

The only consolation for Hamilton on the occasion of his 100th grand prix was that the McLaren showed encouraging pace following a major performance upgrade.
At one stage, Hamilton unlapped himself on Vettel - although not Alonso - as he attempted vainly to recover from his early set-back. A move which angered the double world champion.
Alonso was never very far in front but was always able to stay just far enough ahead of first Vettel and then Button to ensure they could not use their DRS overtaking aids to pass him into the hairpin at Turn 6.
It led to a tense grand prix in which the identity of the winner was always in doubt until Alonso took the chequered flag.
The Ferrari made a lightning start from pole position and although Vettel quickly closed up the initial gap Alonso had built on the first lap, the Spaniard was able to pull clear before their first pit stops to ensure he held the lead into the second stint.
Meanwhile, Button was fighting past Hulkenberg and then Schumacher, to move quietly into third place.
Vettel emerged from his first pit stop five seconds ahead of Button but the McLaren closed remorselessly on the Red Bull and passed the German by making his second stop a lap earlier.
Vettel emerged from the pits to find Button on his outside on the run to Turn 2, and the McLaren easily took the position.
Button was rarely more than a second behind Alonso from then until the end of the race but the Ferrari driver was always in control and in the closing laps he stretched away as Button began to lose grip in his rear tyres.
Rather than try to take the lead, Button had to spend the closing laps fighting off a late challenge from Vettel, who passed him at the Turn 6 hairpin on the penultimate lap.
Vettel said: ""The pace was there but it was extremely difficult when I was close to Fernando and Jenson we seemed to lose a lot and not be able to stay close enough to try to something under braking.
""I am not entirely happy, it could have been a bit better if it was clean air most of the race but that was not the case. Second place was the best we could get today and I am happy with that.""
Button said: ""It was a close race and I couldn't quite get Fernando at the end.
""When you are in the middle of three you really have to fight and I was pushing a little bit more in the early part of the stint, whereas when you're in front you can coast a bit in the bits where you don't need to push.
""It was close but Fernando knows as we all do where to use Kers to keep someone behind you. I ran out of steam at the end of the straight and the gap was a little bit too big to get back.
""But it was a fun race and it's nice to be on the podium again. I've had my feeling back the last two races but the pace hasn't been there [in the car], but today it was. We're there or thereabouts at the front, still a little way to go.""

With the future of Sir Dave Brailsford - and perhaps even Team Sky - uncertain after months of damaging revelations, this is an attempted fight-back, with several riders closing ranks around their under-fire boss at the request of management.
However, it has not escaped attention that the team's leading man, Chris Froome, is yet to make clear his support, instead tweeting about a meal he enjoyed in South Africa. And if that is an act of defiance, it could place even more pressure on Brailsford as he tries to cling to his job.

Freeman, meanwhile, has also received the support of a former colleague.
Dave Readle, who was a sports psychologist at the governing body's high performance programme from 2008 to 2014, and worked closely with Freeman, told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that the doctor ""has been thrown under the bus"".
MPs at last week's select committee hearing were told how Freeman had failed to keep medical records of treatments for riders - a possible breach of General Medical Council rules, according to the UK Anti-Doping Agency - and ordered large quantities of the corticosteroid triamcinolone, that may have outstripped clinical need.
Freeman administered Wiggins' TUEs, and took delivery of the mystery medical package in France 2011. It has also been reported that fellow doctors at Team Sky blocked him applying for a fourth TUE for Wiggins, and that he was in charge of medical supplies when testosterone patches were delivered to British Cycling in 2011, apparently in error.
He has denied any wrongdoing, and is thought to be preparing written submissions to Ukad's questions.
Freeman withdrew from giving evidence to the select committee on the eve of the hearing last week due to ill health. But Readle said: ""Richard has been hung out to dry. He is a loyal friend, a man of honesty, integrity and loyalty, and this is a tough time for him. All this negative publicity, he's in a state of shock.
""The fact that no one's come out to support him, after all the help he's given riders, it stinks.
""I spent a lot of time with him and everything he did was above board, there was no cutting corners.""
When asked why Freeman may have failed to keep medical records, Readle said that the intensity of the workload while treating large numbers of athletes and other staff may have meant that the doctor's administration sometimes slipped.

Ms Castedo is in Brazil where she is seeking asylum.
The crash killed 71 people, including most of the Chapecoense football team.
The plane was taking the team to Colombia for the final of a regional tournament when it ran out of fuel, plunging into a mountainside near the city of Medellin.

In her letter (in Spanish) published in the Bolivian media, Ms Castedo, who worked in air traffic control, said she had no authority to stop the doomed flight, saying that was with Bolivia's civil aviation agency.
She said that instead of authorising the flight, she had tried to stop it, accusing unnamed superiors of a cover-up.
""I was subjected to harassment and pressure from my superiors... who ordered me to change the content of the report which hours earlier [before the flight] I had presented,"" she wrote.

666,668,"Rooney, 30, played in midfield rather than as a striker and came under fire following the shock defeat by Iceland.
""He's our talisman, he's our greatest goalscorer, he's experienced and you don't want that to walk away at this stage,"" Lampard told BBC Sport.
""I would want him in the team and in the squad. He has certainly got another tournament in him.""
Rooney has scored a record 53 goals in 115 appearances for his country.
The Manchester United man was made England captain in August 2014 but has come under scrutiny for a number of disappointing displays.
He found the net from the penalty spot after just four minutes against Iceland but underperformed for most of the game in Nice as England went out of Euro 2016 at the last-16 stage.
In the wake of the defeat, Germany legend Lothar Matthaus said it was time for Rooney to retire from international football.
""Sadly, when his team needed him, Rooney was not that leader,"" he said.
""You need someone who can provide the impetus and rhythm. I thought Rooney could take the role but, when it mattered, he wasn't able to do it.""

""I think once we reflect a bit more, Wayne will remain a big player in the squad and will help with the development of the younger players around him,"" insisted Lampard, who won 106 caps for England.
However, the former Chelsea and West Ham midfielder thinks he needs to work out his best position for both club and country.
Under Louis van Gaal, Rooney began to play in midfield as well as a striker but that may change now Jose Mourinho is manager of Manchester United.
""I don't believe 31 is an age where you need to change position because of being 31, said Lampard, now playing in the United States with New York City.
""I think Wayne still has the pace, the ability and the knowhow to play as a striker, but the choice will obviously be between him and his managers.""
Rooney has already said he would continue to be available for international selection.
England's next game is a 2018 World Cup qualifier in Slovakia on 4 September.
England should not be afraid of appointing another foreign coach as a successor to Roy Hodgson, said Lampard, who played under Swede Sven-Goran Eriksson and Italian Fabio Capello during his time with the national side.
""Ideally, as a proud Englishman, you'd love an English manager,"" he said.
""But I think, in the modern world, you have to accept that, if the options aren't there, you have to look abroad.
""It wouldn't bother me if a foreign manager took an England team forward and was successful, not at all.""
England are looking for a new manager as Englishman Hodgson quit immediately after the defeat by Iceland.
Under Eriksson, England reached the quarter-finals at three successive major tournaments, while Capello led England to the 2010 World Cup and a 4-1 defeat by Germany in the second round.
""I think the best man for the job would be the starting point for picking the next manager,"" added Lampard, who would prefer a youthful boss, adding: ""Over the last 10-15 years, when I was playing, we weren't setting a new tone.
""I would look to a younger, forward-thinking manager who has a real strong idea about how he wants to play, plays good football, generates a good spirit in the team and go that way.""
But he believes it will not be a straightforward task for the Football Association.
""I can't give you the name, which is the problem, but they will have to have a confidence in the decision they make,"" said Lampard.
""They'll have to give him free reign to try to mould these good young players into a team that can fight at the top level.""","Wayne Rooney still has a future with England despite their Euro 2016 failure, says Frank Lampard.",36676349,"According to Frank Lampard, Wayne Rooney should continue to be a part of the England national team, but he needs to figure out his best position, and the Football Association should not be afraid to appoint a foreign coach as a successor to Roy Hodgson, as long as they have confidence in the decision and give the new manager free reign to mold the team.",0,"Article: {}

He will be in charge for the final time when they host Birmingham as the Championship season ends on Saturday.

Slade joined Cardiff in October 2014 from Leyton Orient and has said he wants to stay with the Bluebirds.
He held talks with chairman Mehmet Dalman following the defeat at Sheffield Wednesday which ended their play-off hopes.
Slade has insisted he has made ''progress'' at Cardiff this season with the Bluebirds destined to finish either seventh or eighth, having been placed 11th at the end of the 2014-15 season.
He succeeded Ole Gunnar Solskjaer who was in charge when Cardiff were relegated from their only season in the Premier League, 2013-14.
Cardiff had targeted a place in the play-offs, and fell short as they recorded one win in their previous six matches.

676,678,"The announcement came hours after the pirates and naval forces exchanged gunfire over a boat believed to be carrying supplies to the hijackers.
The tanker, which was en route from Djibouti to the Somali capital, Mogadishu, was seized on Monday with eight Sri Lankan crew members on board.
It is the first hijack off Somalia's coast since 2012.
Abdirahman Mohamud Hassan, the director general of the Puntland maritime police force, said: ""There has been discussion going on after the gunfight this afternoon... We took our forces back and thus the pirates went away.""
The Sri Lankan foreign ministry said the crew members were released ""unharmed, without the payment of a ransom"".
A pirate confirmed the release was made without a ransom payment, according to Reuters.
However, John Steed, a former British army officer who has spent years negotiating the release of piracy hostages in Somalia, told the AFP news agency they had been made an offer they could not refuse.
Mr Hassan earlier said that ""pirates"" on board the tanker had opened fire on Thursday after authorities tried to intercept a boat believed to be carrying essential supplies, such as food.
Four people were wounded in the exchange of fire on Thursday, the BBC has learned.
The Puntland authorities deployed local forces in the area in an attempt to assist rescue efforts for the hostages on board the vessel, the district commissioner said.
The vessel was carrying oil and was owned by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), despite conflicting reports over the flag it was sailing under, he added.
On Wednesday, the European Union anti-piracy naval force, which is helping to tackle piracy in the region, said the hijackers had been demanding a ransom.
Authorities were then still trying to determine whether the gunmen, who have not given any details about the size of the ransom, were organised pirates or fishermen whose equipment was destroyed by illegal fishing vessels, as they had claimed to be.
The EU force earlier made contact with the ship's master, who said his vessel and crew were being held captive anchored off the coast of north-east Somalia. The ship's tracking system has reportedly been switched off.
Piracy off the coast of Somalia, usually for ransom, has reduced significantly in recent years, in part because of extensive international military patrols as well as support for local fishing communities.
At the height of the crisis in 2011, there were 237 attacks and the annual cost of piracy was estimated to be up to $8bn (Â£7bn).
However, some smaller fishing vessels have recently been seized in the area.
In 2015, Somali officials warned that piracy could return unless the international community helped create jobs and security ashore, as well as combating illegal fishing at sea.
Some Somali fishermen turned to piracy after their livelihoods were destroyed by illegal fishing from foreign trawlers, which benefited from the lack of a functioning coastguard in the country following years of conflict.","Somali pirates who hijacked an oil tanker have released it without condition, according to officials.",39295936,"Sure!

682,684,"He said that a rugby player has many ways to score a try but the route he so often chose was the shortest route: ""Straight over a fella. Sometimes you need to run at people rather than around them - you need to put a bit of manners on them.""
Foley - or Axel to his mates - died suddenly on Sunday in Paris and the game in Ireland, and beyond, is going to take some time to try to comprehend this outrageous loss.
When the news broke you thought of his family, of course. You thought of all those people at his beloved Shannon RFC, where it all started for him. You thought of his legion of fans at Munster, who hold him up as one of their greatest and most influential sons.
The numbers of his playing career are impressive - 201 appearances for Munster and 62 Tests for his country, 86 European ties, three European finals, three semi-finals.
No list of his accomplishments would be complete without cataloguing the five All Ireland League titles he won with Shannon. Those victories meant as much to him as anything. Hard rugby played in front of passionate rugby people. This was where Foley was at his happiest. It was what Foley was born to do.
And yet the number that jumped out at you on this grim day was 42 - his age. It's no age.
He had taken his first steps in coaching with Munster - he was head coach and in Paris for Munster's opening fixture of the Champions Cup against Racing 92 - and though he had a lot to learn, the story of his playing career told you emphatically that one day he would learn it all and achieve greatness as a coach, too.

Ten years ago he wrote: ""If I'm going to be remembered I'd like to be seen as a stubborn player, somebody who wouldn't give in. There were times during my career when I could have called it quits and gone off and done other things - but there was always a goal there, always something to achieve.
""Once there's something to chase, I'll chase it.""
Foley underplayed his ability. For sure, he was a stubborn back-row forward, a number eight that would never take a backward step for anybody. But he was intelligent. His reading of rugby games was extraordinary at times.
""The smartest rugby player I have ever had the honour of playing with or against,"" said Keith Wood, the former Ireland captain and Foley's boyhood friend.
It was easy to see where Foley got it from. He was born into a rugby family - or more particularly, a Shannon family.
Shannon people will tell you there's a difference. They'll say there's no rugby family is like a Shannon rugby family - and therein lies the beauty of rugby in Limerick because Young Munster people say the same thing about themselves, as do those in Garryowen, Old Crescent, Bohemians and many other clubs in this rugby-mad city.
Foley loved the intercity rivalry. It was bred into him.
Long before he brought his uncompromising will to the Shannon and Munster dressing room, his father had done it already.
Brendan Foley did not have a lot as a kid, but what he had was a devotion to the game, a hunger to become good at it and an ability to pass on its joys to his son and daughter, Rosie, who won 39 caps for the Ireland women's team.
""As a small boy I was sent to games with him,"" Foley recalled. ""I carried his bag into the changing room at Thomond Park [Shannon's and Munster's home ground] and I minded the spot where he used to tog out - I was very protective of it.""
When Foley started playing for Munster in October 1994, he sat in the same spot where his father had sat.
He excelled. He was never the quickest or most athletic back-row forward - far from it - but he had, in Wood's words, ""a sixth sense, an uncanny ability to be in the right place at the right time"".
He flitted in and out of the Ireland team over the years, a succession of coaches unappreciative of his qualities. In Munster, they loved him unconditionally.
His leadership was legendary. When Munster suffered a setback he'd tell his team-mates to stick the memory of the loss into what he called the ""bitterness bank"". He used bitterness in a big way. They still use it now at Thomond Park.
At the beginning of the European Cup in 1995, Munster were an irrelevance. Their form in their bear pit in the middle of Limerick tended to be thunderous and many big wins were achieved, but there was no consistency, no apparent hope of them achieving anything.
The Foleys and the Mick Galweys and the Peter Clohessys - the Munster totems - drove the team forward. Foley instilled his principles into the new wave - Alan Quinlan, David Wallace, Ronan O'Gara, Peter Stringer, John Hayes, Paul O'Connell, Donncha O'Callaghan.
A team in Foley's own image had been created.
Munster made the Heineken Cup final in 2000 and 2002, losing both. They made the semi-finals in 2001, 2003 and 2004 and lost them, too. People in the province wondered if they would ever achieve their ultimate goal.
Foley never wondered or never had thoughts of surrender. He drove on, as honest and ferocious as ever.
In the 2006 Heineken Cup final he captained the team to victory against Biarritz at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium and wrote his name in Munster history just as his father did when playing in the side that beat the All Blacks at Thomond Park 28 years earlier in the most storied Irish rugby game of them all.
His loss is profoundly shocking. His list of achievements is long, but nowhere near as lengthy as the queue of people who wish to explain what he did and what he meant.","Anthony Foley once described rugby as, basically, ""a street fight with a ball"".",37672789,"The sudden death of former Munster and Ireland rugby player Axel Foley at the age of 42 has sent shockwaves through the rugby community, with tributes pouring in for his leadership, intelligence, and unwavering passion for the sport, which he passed on to generations of players through his unforgettable playing career and coaching beginnings.",0,"Article: {}

684,686,"The BBC has seen a copy of the document, which is due to be formally signed off on Thursday.
It contains policies on nationalising railways and renewing the Trident weapons system and suggests Labour will not leave the EU without a deal.
Labour would not comment on the leak but the Tories called it ""a shambles"".
According to the draft, Labour would:
On energy, Labour would have at least one publicly-owned supplier in every region of the country, with the government controlling the transmission and distribution grids.
First it would introduce an ""immediate emergency price cap"" of £1,000 a year.
The manifesto still has to be approved by around 80 Labour figures, including the shadow cabinet and the party's National Executive Committee.
The final version will form the foundation of Labour's pitch to voters on the 8 June general election.
A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""We do not comment on leaks. We will announce our policies in our manifesto, which is our plan to transform Britain for the many, not the few.""
The draft document is seen by some senior Labour figures as the most left-wing manifesto since the party was led by Michael Foot in 1983.
It certainly appears to be the most detailed in a generation with a 20-point plan for workers' rights alone.
Many individual policies are likely to be popular - not every privatisation is seen as having been a success and polling suggests the commitments to renationalise the railways and cap energy prices aren't as controversial as critics would claim
But opponents and sceptical voters will await further detail behind the assertion that everything has been costed.
Privately, many Labour MPs believe Jeremy Corbyn will get the manifesto he wants but in return he must take full responsibility if voters find it less appealing than he does .
Many of the policies have been previously announced by Labour or were proposed by Mr Corbyn during his successful leadership campaign.
These include banning fracking, and the draft manifesto also says nuclear power would continue to be supported.
On welfare, Labour says it would scrap benefit sanctions and the so-called ""bedroom tax"" and restore housing benefit for people aged under 21.
The triple lock protecting the state pension would be maintained, and the retirement age would not increase beyond 66.
The draft was initially leaked to the Mirror and the Daily Telegraph.
A Conservative spokesman said: ""This is a total shambles. Jeremy Corbyn's plans to unleash chaos on Britain have been revealed.
""The commitments in this dossier will rack up tens of billions of extra borrowing for our families and will put Brexit negotiations at risk.""
In other general election news, the Conservatives are pledging to continue meeting the Nato target of spending 2% of GDP on defence.
Prime Minister Theresa May said she was also extending by two years a pledge to increase the defence budget by at least 0.5% above inflation annually.

685,687,"Police officers are allowed to search people for items such as drugs, stolen goods and weapons.
But there has been controversy over ""consensual searches"", where people are searched without any legal basis.
If approved by parliament, the code will end consensual searches from May.
Ministers asked an advisory group of experts to draft the code following a BBC Scotland investigation which revealed that hundreds of children under the age of 12 were being subjected to consensual stop searches.
The new code states that stopping and searching members of the public is a ""significant intrusion into their personal liberty and privacy"".
It must therefore be done for a good reason, and be both ""necessary and proportionate"", it says.
This means that the officer must have a ""reasonable suspicion"" based on ""facts, information and/or intelligence"" that the person being searched is likely to be carrying an illegal item.
But officers will not be allowed to search someone based purely on their appearance - for example age, race or gender - or because they have previous convictions.
The codes states: ""A stop and search will not be carried out in a manner which is abusive, discriminatory, or which amounts to harassment or intimidation.""
The person being searched must understand why it is being carried out, with the officer also required to carry it out ""with respect for individual needs - including religious and cultural values and beliefs.""
And officers must be ""fully accountable"" for the searches they carry out, with all stop and searches accurately recorded, and open to scrutiny.
The code also sets out specific guidelines for dealing with children and vulnerable adults, and acknowledges that that they may require additional support to help them comprehend and participate in the search process.
It says: ""In taking a decision to search a child or a young person, a constable must treat the need to safeguard and promote the well-being of that child or young person as a primary consideration.
""Where a constable believes it to be more harmful to a child or young person to carry out a search than not, then the search should not proceed and other measures to safeguard them should be considered.""
It also says that officers should use ""age-appropriate terms"" when speaking with children and young people and avoid the use of technical or legal language, unless required to do so by law.
The Scottish government announced on 4 November 2016 that there is not enough evidence to support creating a police power to search children for alcohol at this time.
The situation will be re-assessed after the code has been in force for 12 months
A code of practice underpinning the use of stop and search is required under The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2016.
Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said stop and search was a valuable tool for combating crime, but that it was important to strike a balance between protecting the public and recognising people's human rights.
He said: ""This new code is about finding that balance and maintaining the trust between the police and the public.
""With this new code we will ensure stop and search is carried out with the fairness, integrity, respect and accountability that we expect from our police officers in all of their duties.""
Research published by Edinburgh University in 2014 showed police in Scotland were far more likely to carry out stop and searches than their colleagues in England and Wales.
The figures also suggested that young people were the most likely to be searched.
But the number of stop-and-searches has fallen dramatically since then, with 888 consensual searches and 20,665 statutory searches conducted between 1 April and 30 September last year.
This compared with 450,173 consensual searches and 192,470 statutory searches in 2013/14.
Assistant Chief Constable Mark Williams said Police Scotland had made ""real progress"" on the issue, and ""very much welcomed"" the new guidelines.
He added: ""We are currently training all our officers in advance of its introduction to ensure we are fully prepared.""","Police officers will only be able to stop and search people when they have ""reasonable grounds"" to do so under new rules published by the Scottish government.",38582400,"The Scottish government has announced a new code of practice for police stop and search, which aims to strike a balance between protecting the public and respecting individuals' human rights, and includes specific guidelines for dealing with children and vulnerable adults.",0,"Article: {}

A spokesman said no-one had been injured although two security guards aged 47 and 49 were left badly shaken.
The area around the bank, which is near the Buchanan Galleries shopping centre, has been cordoned off by police.
Police said the security guards had been making their delivery when they were approached by the three armed men, who threatened them and demanded they hand over a box of money. It is understood the cash taken was in the region of Â£50,000.
Following the robbery, the three men got into a white Seat Leon car, which sped off along West Nile Street towards the Cowcaddens area.
The car has since been found in Scott Street, near Stow College. Police said it was being taken for forensic examination.
Inquiries have so far revealed that the car performed a u-turn on West Nile Street, causing a cyclist to take evasive action to avoid a collision, immediately prior to the robbery.

687,689,"But this is where you find the alleged mastermind of Turkey's failed coup, the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
And he has broken his customary seclusion to give rare interviews defending himself against the accusations levelled by his nemesis, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Who was behind Turkey coup attempt?
Turkey police and officials purged
How mobiles beat tanks and saved Erdogan
We were greeted at the Golden Generation Worship & Retreat Center by polite, well-spoken men who serve as the first line of gate-keepers to the revered preacher and writer.
They belong to organisations inspired by Mr Gulen, not run by him, a testament to the strength of his personality and the appeal of his message. He advocates a Sufi-based Islam of tolerance that emphasises education and promotes business.
In Turkey, though, critics view this style of leadership as a threat, saying he wields much unelected political influence through followers who have heavily penetrated the bureaucracy and have links to media and business.
The retreat sprawls over 25 lush green acres (10 hectares) in the foothills of the Poconus Mountains. But the cleric, it was emphasised, occupies only a single, spartan bedroom in one of the buildings. We were shown a desk, a small bed and a small mat.
He met us in an adjacent room, seated beneath a framed admonition to ""Continue to Love"", written in Arabic calligraphy. He rose to greet us but his strength failed him and he fell back onto the sofa.
The real gatekeeper is Mr Gulen's doctor, who gave him medication so he could manage the interview.
Although his heart condition and diabetes have made him very frail, his language was anything but.
He condemned the coup attempt as treason, claiming that ""even if at the helm of the country there are people who would like to replace me and suppress me and oppress me at the level of blood-sucking vampires, even then I do not want to remove them with anti-democratic means"".
""This is my attitude toward any and even the idea of the consideration of a military coup.""
It may be that he sees President Erdogen as a vampire after his blood.
The two men once banded together to curb the power of Turkey's secular military.
But a few years ago Mr Erdogan became suspicious that Mr Gulen's followers were driving a corruption investigation that targeted his inner circle. He moved to stamp out any alternative power centre, even if it was another Islamic one.
Since then he has been purging them from state institutions. Mr Gulen called this a ""witch-hunt"" which accelerated after the failed coup.
""It's not possible to talk about democracy any more,"" he said of reported excesses. ""This kind of regime resembles more of a clan and a tribal administration.""
Without naming Mr Erdogan, he compared him to dictators such as Hitler and Saddam Hussein.
But he counselled his followers to remain peaceful because ""society is already polarised enough, don't make it worse"".
Ironically Mr Gulen fled to America in 1999 amid accusations of trying to overthrow the secular government. Now it is an Islamist one demanding that the US send him back.
He seemed unfazed by Mr Erdogan's plan to lodge a formal extradition request. He declared it would be politically motivated rather than legally sound, and therefore would not get much attention in a country where ""the rule of law reigns supreme"".
The issue, however, is getting much attention: already it's led to some sharp exchanges between Turkish and American officials. And it could create further headaches for the US government, especially if the evidence provided does not stand up in an American court.
Once again Mr Gulen sought to rise above the political to the spiritual.

689,691,"But Mikel, 25, has been charged by the FA with misconduct following his involvement in the incident.
The Blues had claimed Clattenburg directed racial language at Mikel in their home defeat by Manchester United.
""The FA's verdict of no case to answer against referee Mark Clattenburg was hardly a surprise.
""Ever since it emerged the alleged victim John Obi Mikel hadn't even heard the comment but was relying on second-hand evidence from Brazilian team-mate Ramires, Chelsea's case looked as wafer thin as their managerial contracts.
""Rightly, given how high the stakes were, the FA has taken its time to be sure.
""And while their reluctance to criticise Chelsea for bringing the case is designed to avoid other players from clamming up if they believe they have been racially abused, this is yet another damaging blow for a club which seems a magnet for trouble.""
Clattenburg said it was ""truly frightening"" to have faced the prospect that his career might be over.
Following the match at Stamford Bridge on 28 October, the FA interviewed Clattenburg, Mikel and several other Blues players before reaching its decision to clear the official and charge the Nigerian.
""It is alleged that in or around the match officials' changing room at the end of the fixture, Mikel used threatening and/or abusive and/or insulting words and/or behaviour,"" an FA statement read.
Mikel has until Friday, 30 November to respond. Chelsea have indicated he will not deny the charge but will request a hearing to ""explain the mitigating circumstances"".
The evidence for Chelsea's allegation towards Clattenburg came from their midfielder Ramires who, when interviewed, explained that his instinctive reaction was to seek confirmation from Mikel as to what the referee said.
Mikel, who was being spoken to by Clattenburg, was much closer than Ramires and did not hear what it is suggested was said to him.
The two assistant referees and the fourth official revealed they did not hear any of the comments Clattenburg was accused of making, despite being linked up to the referee via microphones.
An FA statement also said the complaint by Mikel's team-mate Ramires was ""made in good faith"".
Clattenburg, 37, has always maintained his innocence and the Metropolitan Police dropped its own inquiry earlier this month.
He missed four weekends of Premier League matches while the FA investigated Chelsea's complaint.
""I am looking forward to putting this behind me and concentrating on refereeing in the Premier League and other competitions,"" said Clattenburg.
""The messages of encouragement from those inside and outside of the game have helped me through the most stressful time of my professional life.
""To know you were innocent but there was the opportunity for it to wreck your career was truly frightening.
""Racism has no place in football and this experience should not discourage those to speak out if they genuinely believe they are a victim of abuse.
""However, there are processes that should be adhered to in order that any investigation can be carried out in a manner that is fair for all parties involved.
""I know first hand the ramifications of allegations of this nature being placed into the public domain ahead of a formal process and investigation. I hope no referee has to go through this in the future.""
What has happened over the last few weeks should not overshadow the fact the on-pitch relationship between match officials, players and managers is the best we've ever known it
Responding to the announcement, a Chelsea statement said: ""Chelsea Football Club accepts the Football Association's decision regarding Mark Clattenburg and welcomes the fact that the FA recognises the club and players were correct in reporting the matter.
""The club accepts the case is now concluded and notes the FA states the allegation was made in good faith.
""Chelsea FC has a duty of care, as do all employers, to act responsibly when such allegations are reported by employees.
""We did not take the decision to lodge a formal complaint with the FA lightly and followed the correct processes and protocols throughout.""

701,703,"In London, Labour's Sadiq Khan defeated Conservative Zac Goldsmith to become mayor. Khan came out on top in three constituencies that had voted for former mayor of London Boris Johnson in 2012.
After second preferences were counted and transferred, Khan received a total of 1,310,143 votes (56.8%) and Goldsmith 994,614 (43.2%).
The Labour candidate gained 44.2% of first preference votes, with Goldsmith securing 35%. Green Party candidate Sian Berry came in third with 5.8%. Full details of London's results are available here.
The mayor has control over four major policy areas in London - transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning - and the London Assembly scrutinises the mayor's policies.
In the London Assembly election, Labour secured 12 seats while the Conservatives ended up with eight. The Green Party had the third most votes and have two seats in the Assembly, as do UKIP. The Lib Dems claimed the remaining seat.
The SNP will retain its grip on government, after having claimed 59 of the 73 constituency seats up for grabs - up six on their 2011 result. Overall, the SNP will occupy 63 of the 129 seats at Holyrood, with the Conservatives becoming the second-largest party on 31. Labour took 24, the Greens six (all from the regional lists), and the Lib Dems five.
Some of the SNP's gains came at Labour's expense in Glasgow, which now represents a clean sweep for the governing party. It also took Edinburgh Northern and Leith from Labour.
But it faltered elsewhere in the capital, losing Edinburgh Central to the Conservatives and Edinburgh Western to the Lib Dems. The Scottish Labour Party recaptured Edinburgh Southern from the SNP.

As the interactive vote-share map above demonstrates, the Labour party's share of the constituency vote in Scotland was concentrated in areas where it largely failed to get over the finish line ahead of the SNP.
The SNP, on the other hand, dominated the count nearly everywhere in the country, winning more than 30% of the vote in all but three constituencies.
The Scottish Conservatives increased their share of the vote by more than eight percentage points, once again doing best along the border with England, but their strong performance in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire was enough to win them one constituency seat there too. With regional results factored in, the party gained 16 seats on the previous election in 2011 and will now be the second-largest party in the Scottish parliament.
That the Lib Dems doubled their constituency seat count, from two to four, masks a dismal night for the party, which lost its deposit in 48 constituencies.
For the first time since the parliament's creation in 1999, the Lib Dems are fifth in the political pecking order.
With six MSPs - one less than it had in 2003 but four more than the 2011 election - the Scottish Greens now stand as the fourth largest party in the Holyrood chamber. It won all of its seats through the regional list system and not through the constituency vote.
Labour is likely to seek to form a minority government after winning 29 of the 60 seats in Thursday's election, according to first minister Carwyn Jones.
Just one constituency changed hands, when Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood captured the Rhondda from the governing party.
The biggest shift in Welsh politics was the rise of UKIP, which has won seven regional seats.

Although UKIP did not manage to clinch any constituency seats, the interactive map above shows the five places where it won more than 20% of the constituency vote: Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Newport East, Islwyn, and Torfaen, where it came in second place, and Caerphilly, where it came third.
In three of these seats, UKIP's gains appear to have come mostly at Labour's expense, in one the losses were shared fairly evenly between Labour and the Lib Dems, and in one the Lib Dems lost out the most. The Conservatives also lost vote share in three of the five constituencies, but to a lesser extent.
A total of 124 councils were up for re-election, in part or in whole.
After all the results were counted Labour lost 18 councillors, but held on to control of all but one of its 58 councils: Dudley, and gained control of Bristol.
The Conservatives lost a total of 48 council seats. The party lost control of two councils, but gained control of Peterborough.
The Lib Dems gained 45 councillors in total, and won back Watford council from no overall control.
UKIP gained 25 more council seats - but was not able to convert these gains into control of any council.
At 68.3%, turnout was highest in Scotland in the battle for Eastwood, a constituency to the south west of Glasgow, in which the Conservatives ultimately prevailed over Labour. It was lowest at 42.9% just 20 miles up the road in Glasgow Provan, where the SNP delivered a drubbing to Labour.

702,704,"Mr Swinney said the UK government's recent spending review placed ""unprecedented pressure"" on public expenditure north of the border.
The UK government said Scottish ministers would have £390m more in spending available to them next year.
Mr Swinney is due to present his 2016-17 spending plans on Wednesday.
The Scottish government argues that cuts imposed by the UK government since 2010 - along with last month's spending review - mean that its discretionary budget will be 12.5% lower in real terms by 2019-20 than it was in 2010-11.
Mr Swinney said 4.2% of that reduction would come between now and 2019-20.
He said: ""The chancellor (George Osborne) has imposed real terms cuts on Scotland every year from now until 2020, and more than £1bn of those cuts are still to come between now and the end of the decade.
""We have demonstrated that the UK government didn't have to take this approach. Debt and the deficit could have been reduced without this scale of cuts that has been chosen by the chancellor.
""Now Scotland has to deal with the reality of the chancellor's decision. We face tough choices in the coming days.
""Against this backdrop, the Scottish government is determined that we will defend and protect the key priorities that the people of Scotland expect us to deliver on.""
Mr Swinney said schools, hospitals and the police service in Scotland would ""not be sacrificed to the chancellor's austerity obsession"".
He added: ""In recent years we have been able to deliver better outcomes for the people of Scotland. More police, lower crime, better schools, tuition-free university education and a health budget that is at a record level.
""These commitments demonstrate the prioritisation of the Scottish government.""
Responding to Mr Swinney comments, a spokesman for the UK government's Scotland Office said: ""The Scottish government will have £390m more spending available to it next year, which rises to £750m if you include its own underspend.
""The stability of the UK economy means the block grant will be almost £30bn.
""One look at the current oil price tells you this is a much better deal for people in Scotland than the constitutional alternative favoured by the Scottish government.
""The Scottish government should perhaps focus more on gearing up for its new powers and getting the best for Scotland, rather than grievance.""
Labour's public services spokeswoman Jackie Baillie said: ""Ahead of the most important budget since devolution, it's time John Swinney backed up his anti-austerity posturing with something real.
""Telling us about pre-election giveaways now and cuts later isn't good enough. This needs to be a long-term budget.

""I've never been approached to take money or anything to fix a match or lose a match. It does go on because people have been banned at lower levels. I'm surprised to see the article come out and talk about higher levels; I certainly haven't been aware of anything going on there.""
The Scot said he had no idea as to the identity of the suspected match-fixers, and suggested additional funding could be granted to the Tennis Integrity Unit (TIU), set-up to police the sport.
""Your guess is as good as mine,"" he said of those involved. ""There were no names in the article because it's very difficult to prove anything. I think that's the issue the TIU has in that a match can be reported or look suspicious, but it doesn't necessarily mean players are guilty.
""It can just be people throwing money on a match.""
Fleming was adamant, though, that no such activities were occurring in Melbourne.

Newly passed laws in both states allow businesses to refuse service to LGBT people.

In North Carolina, legislation passed by Governor Pat McCrory invalidates previously passed legislation from Charlotte, that state's largest city, that enacted LGBT protections.
His new law states that transgender people must use public bathrooms according to the gender on their birth certificates. Mississippi's law has a similar bathroom provision and also protects dozens of forms of businesses and services from being prosecuted by the government for refusing to serve LGBT people.
It is ""both frightening and embarrassing that one of our nation's staunchest allies has warned its citizens of the risks"" of travelling to the US, said Ty Cobb of the Human Rights Campaign.
""It is now more clear than ever that these terrible measures are not only harming individuals and taking an economic toll on the states, but are also causing serious damage to our nation's reputation, and the perceived safety of LGBT people who travel here.""
Companies are curtailing their businesses in the states because of the law, and several entertainers have cancelled performances in both states over the law.

Serena, 35, won 6-4 6-4 to pass Steffi Graf in the all-time list of major winners since the Grand Slams accepted professional players in 1968.
The American regains the number one ranking from German Angelique Kerber.
Australia's Margaret Court, with 24, is the only player still ahead of Serena in terms of Grand Slam singles titles.
""Congratulations Serena on number 23,"" said Venus, who at 36 is the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era.
""I have been right there with you, some of them I lost right there against you. It's been an awesome win.
""I'm enormously proud of you, you mean the world to me. I, God willing, would love to come back. Thank you for all the love.""
Serena paid tribute to her sister, who was playing her first major final for eight years, saying: ""There's no way I would be at 23 without her. There's no way I'd be at one without her. She's my inspiration.
""She's the only reason I'm standing here today. She's the only reason the Williams sisters exist. Thank you for inspiring me. Every time you won this week, I felt like I got a win too.""
Serena went into the match as a strong favourite, but the tension was apparent as early as the third game when she smashed a racquet in frustration, receiving a code violation.
She had broken serve in the first and third games only to hand the advantage straight back each time, three double faults inexplicably littering a desperate game for 2-2.
It was clear the six-time champion was struggling to settle, with 13 unforced errors in the opening five games, while elder sister Venus kept her under pressure with some deep hitting.
The decisive move of the set came with a superb drop volley followed by a thumping forehand winner from Serena to break for 4-3, and this time she managed to consolidate on serve.
In contrast to the opening stages, the following nine games went with serve - Venus recovering superbly from 0-40 early in the second set - but it was Serena who was creating the chances.
She finally capitalised on her sixth break point of the set with a brilliant return to lead 4-3 and followed it up with her best service game of the match for 5-3.
The crowd on Rod Laver Arena had been backing Venus from the beginning as she tried to win a first major title for eight years, and all the more so as defeat loomed and she appeared to struggle physically.
There was a huge cheer when she held serve to force her sister to serve out the match, but Serena recovered from 15-30 to earn match point and fell back on the court in celebration as her sister sent the ball floating wide.
Saturday's final was the 28th instalment of the sisters' on-court rivarly, which began at the Australian Open back in 1998, with Serena now 17-11 ahead and 7-2 up in Grand Slam finals.
Venus, who turned professional in 1994 and has won five Wimbledon and two US Open titles, insisted she was not too disappointed after reaching her first major final since 2009.
""No, because I guess I've been here before, ""she said. ""I really enjoy seeing the name 'Williams' on the trophy. This is a beautiful thing.""
Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent:
Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Serena Williams is the length of time she has been winning Grand Slam titles. The first came on 11 September 1999 in New York; the 23rd on 28 January 2017 here in Melbourne.
The match itself will quickly be forgotten; but never the achievement. Richard Williams used to beg tennis clubs to part with their old balls when he started to put his daughters through their paces in the Los Angeles district of Compton, and now Serena has more Grand Slam singles titles than anyone who has ever played the game, with the exception of Margaret Court.
Williams is now just one behind the Australian - who was watching on the Rod Laver Arena - and in the view of the 18-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratilova, it is a record she could ""shatter"" before her playing days are done.

709,711,"The judge also fined him 1m shekels ($289,000; Â£171,000) and ordered that 560,000 shekels in assets be seized.
Olmert's lawyers said he was innocent and would appeal. If he is unsuccessful he will become the first former head of government in Israel to be jailed.
The 68-year-old was convicted in March over a real estate deal that took place while he served as mayor of Jerusalem.
The Tel Aviv District Court found he had accepted a 500,000-shekel ($145,000; Â£86,000) bribe from the developers of a controversial apartment complex, known as Holyland, for which planning and zoning laws were changed, and another 60,000 shekels for a separate project.
By Yolande KnellBBC News, Jerusalem
This jail sentence is a dramatic fall from grace for a man who was once one of the most powerful figures in Israel.
It is also likely to end any hopes of a political comeback for Ehud Olmert.
Recently, as he criticised the Israeli government's handling of peace talks with the Palestinians, it seemed he still held ambitions to return to public life.
However, the judge in this case said that Olmert's crimes involved ""moral turpitude"", meaning he will be barred from office for seven years after serving his sentence.
In his memoirs, Olmert claims he came very close to a peace deal with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas in 2008.
But in his three years in office he also took Israel into two bloody, armed conflicts - the 2006 war with the militant Lebanese Shia Islamist group Hezbollah, and a three-week offensive on Gaza in 2008-2009 that left some 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis dead.
Now corruption has been added to Olmert's political record. However, many Israelis hope his sentencing is a sign that their country is cleaning up its political culture.
Ten other government officials and businesspeople were convicted alongside Olmert. The sentences handed down on Tuesday against six of them ranged from three to seven years.
Judge David Rozen said bribery offences ""contaminate the public sector"" and ""cause the structure of government to collapse"".
He added: ""People who receive bribes give rise to a feeling of disgust and cause the public to despise the state's institutions. The taker of bribes is like a traitor who betrays the public trust that was given to him - trust without which a proper public service cannot be maintained.""
The judge said Olmert had made a ""large contribution to the country"".
But he described his offences as ""noxious"" and said he was guilty of ""moral turpitude"", which under Israeli law would preclude him from running for public office for seven years after finishing his jail term.
Olmert reportedly stood quietly in the courtroom with his head bowed. His lawyers had sought a non-custodial sentence.
The judge told him to report to prison on 1 September, effectively giving his lawyers time to lodge their planned appeal.
""He did not take a bribe. He did not receive a bribe. He sees himself as innocent, and it is with those feelings that he will be going to the Supreme Court to appeal,"" Olmert's lawyer, Eli Zohar, told reporters.
Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, who served as Olmert's deputy prime minister and foreign minister said: ""It is a difficult day when a former prime minister is sentenced.""
""I have complete trust in the court and law enforcement officials, and the public should as well.""
Olmert served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, until a flurry of corruption allegations led to his resignation.
He was acquitted of most of the major charges eventually brought against him by prosecutors but was also found guilty of breach of trust and given a one-year suspended jail sentence.

711,713,"Thousands of sufferers and their dependants will be able to get damages from a £350m pot over the next decade.
Those diagnosed after 25 July 2012 and who cannot sue former employers as they have gone bust or insurance details have disappeared will be eligible.
Ministers said it was a ""major breakthrough"" to ""end an injustice"".
Mesothelioma is a fatal disease with average survival rates of about nine months after diagnosis.
It is most prevalent among those who worked in industries with heavy exposure to asbestos up to the 1980s, including construction, shipbuilding, engineering and power generation.
About 2,400 people die every year of the disease and numbers are set to increase over the next 30 years, with an estimated death toll of between 56,000 and 63,000.
While some people have taken legal action to recover damages, many are deterred because of the stress involved. The speed with which the disease takes hold means many die before their cases are heard.
Victims and their families have, up to now, been able to claim damages under two pieces of legislation but the sums paid have not generally exceeded £20,000.
Under the proposed new fund, which must receive parliamentary approval, UK claimants will be entitled to 75% of the average settlement paid out in civil actions relating to mesothelioma, expected to be about £115,000.
Claimants will have to demonstrate that they were negligently exposed to asbestos at work and are unable to claim compensation because they cannot track down a liable employer or insurer.
""This scheme represents a major breakthrough for the many victims of this terrible disease, who have been failed by successive governments and the insurance industry for decades,"" said Work and Pensions Minister Mike Penning.
""It will end an injustice that has left many tragic victims and their families high and dry.
""The aggressive and terminal nature of this disease, coupled with the fact we're approaching a peak in cases in the coming years, makes it imperative that we get this legislation in place as soon as possible,"" he added.
According to government calculations, 900 people are likely to qualify for support in 2014, with a further 300 expected to get assistance in each of the following nine years.
If the Mesothelioma Bill currently before Parliament is passed in the next few months, it is hoped the first payments will be made next July.
There has been anger that ministers have proposed a cut-off point for claims and that those diagnosed before 25 July last year, when the scheme was first announced, will not be eligible.
Officials have defended the move, saying that an open-ended commitment to compensate all those afflicted by the disease would simply not be affordable.
Those suffering from other asbestos-related conditions, such as asbestosis, will also not be eligible.
One campaign group said the proposals were a ""drastic improvement"" on the current support available.
But it said the cut-off point seemed ""arbitrary and harsh"" and some victims felt it was unfair that they were not able to claim 100% of the value of a civil settlement.
Mesothelioma often takes 40 to 50 years to manifest itself after exposure and most of those being diagnosed are males in their 60s and older.
The scheme will be paid for by the insurance industry. All insurers will have to register on a voluntary database established in 2011 listing employers' liability insurance policies, both current and historic.","Victims of mesothelioma, an aggressive form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, will be able to claim far larger compensation under a new fund.",25152063,"The UK government has announced a £350 million fund over the next decade to compensate victims of mesothelioma, a fatal cancer caused by asbestos exposure, with eligibility extending to those diagnosed after 2012 who cannot sue former employers due to insurance issues, but excluding those diagnosed before the scheme was announced last year.",0,"Article: {}

714,716,"The Duke of York was named in US court papers relating to the handling of a case against financier Jeffrey Epstein.
In the palace's second statement on the claims, it said those made about the duke were ""without any foundation"".
The Mail on Sunday has named the woman as Virginia Roberts. The BBC has not been able to verify her identity.
Palace officials made a second statement after further details about the allegations were published in Sunday newspapers.
An initial statement had said ""any suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors"" by the duke was ""categorically untrue"".
BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt described the latest palace denial as ""quite remarkable"".
He said it was understood Prince Andrew was now back in the UK after a skiing holiday in Switzerland, and it was likely his first public appearance would be at a reception at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, later this month.
This situation ""has the potential to seriously damage Prince Andrew and the institution he represents,"" our correspondent added.
The woman behind the allegations says she was forced to sleep with the prince when she was under age, and on three occasions - in London, New York and on a private Caribbean island owned by Epstein - between 1999 and 2002.
A US lawyer, meanwhile, says he is planning legal action against the woman.
Alan Dershowitz, who was also named in the court documents, told the BBC he wanted her claims to be made under oath.
Mr Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professor, said: ""My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in court. If she believes she has been hurt by me and Prince Andrew, she should be suing us for damages.
""I welcome that lawsuit. I welcome any opportunity that would put her under oath and require her to state under oath these false allegations.""
Mr Dershowitz also said he thought Prince Andrew should take ""whatever legal action is available"" to clear his name.
He added: ""You cannot allow these false allegations simply to remain out there, and you cannot allow people who make false allegations to have the freedom to continue to make them.""
He previously told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the allegations against Prince Andrew must be presumed to be false, and that he had only met the prince at public occasions.
The woman has issued a statement through her lawyers, saying she was ""looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse"", adding that she was ""not going to be bullied back into silence"".
The court document alleges that Epstein sexually trafficked the woman making her available for sex to ""politically connected and financially powerful people"".
Prince Andrew and Mr Dershowitz are two of three well-known men named in the court document who it alleges had sexual relations with the woman.
The prince, who is fifth in line to the throne, has previously been criticised for his former friendship with Epstein, who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for soliciting a minor for prostitution.
The prince and Epstein were photographed meeting in December 2010, after the tycoon had served his prison sentence, and the prince has also visited Epstein at his Florida home over the years.
The prince later had to apologise for his friendship and stepped down as the UK special representative for trade and investment.
US citizen Virginia Roberts waived her anonymity in an interview with the Mail on Sunday in 2011, claiming she had been sexually exploited by Epstein as a teenager.
She also claimed to have met Prince Andrew on several occasions, but the paper said there was no suggestion of any sexual contact between Virginia Roberts and the prince.","Buckingham Palace has ""emphatically denied"" Prince Andrew had sexual contact with a woman who claims she was forced to have sex with him under age.",30670837,"Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, has been named in US court papers relating to the handling of a case against financier Jeffrey Epstein, with the palace issuing two statements denying any impropriety, while a woman who alleges she was forced to sleep with the prince when she was underage is planning to take legal action and a US lawyer is seeking to have her claims made under oath.",0,"Article: {}

The multi-million pound investment has been partly funded by charitable donations.
By 2012, the scanner appeal had raised £2m, and back then the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust said it expected the machine would be in place by 2013/2014.

720,722,"A shocking claim, based on figures from the Office of National Statistics.
The data for England and Wales shows that in 2015, hunger and/or dehydration were a factor in 828 patient deaths in hospitals and care homes.
But that doesn't mean all of these patients starved to death or died of thirst, experts at the ONS were quick to point out when I spoke with them about it.
Malnutrition may be recorded on the death certificate as a factor contributing directly to a death when it was a complication of a different underlying cause, such as cancer of the stomach, for example.
If you are very sick, it might not be feasible or desirable to eat and drink. Having a disease such as advanced cancer can cause malnutrition.
That's not to say that patients who are terminally ill should have fluid and nutrients withheld. On the contrary, guidelines make it clear that even if a patient can't eat or drink they should still be provided for.
They were drawn up after reports revealed some patients at the end of life were being denied this basic right when they were put on a care protocol called the Liverpool Care Pathway.
The LCP was scrapped in 2015 after relatives complained that their loved ones had been put on it without their knowledge and denied fluids, which hastened their deaths.
Another dark period in history for the NHS was the Stafford Hospital Scandal, where hundreds of patients died amid appalling levels of care between 2005 and 2009.
An inquiry identified terrible and unnecessary suffering, including examples where patients had been provided with food and drink, but it had been left out of their reach.
Joan Morris, 83, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in December 2006 with a chest infection.
Her family said that food and water had been left on a table instead of being given to her.
Another patient, Tom Wilhelms, resorted to drinking from a vase.
In response to the Francis Inquiry into the failings at the Mid Staffordshire Foundation Trust, the government published new hospital standards including around nutritional and hydration care.
And it asked the Care Quality Commission to make sure that the hospitals and care homes it inspected were following these standards.
The CQC's first dedicated review was in 2012.
It inspected 500 care homes and 50 hospitals in England and found 83% of care homes and 88% of hospitals it inspected met people's nutritional needs, which means patients were provided a suitable choice of food and drink and given help to eat and drink when they needed it.
It says this shows things have improved.
Prof Sir Mike Richards, CQC Chief Inspector of Hospitals, said: ""We expect the food provided to be nutritious, to meet people's dietary requirements, and for this to be included as part of patients care planning while in hospital, and we look closely at this on our inspections. Where we find this is not happening or identify concerns that people's nutritional needs are not being met we take action and have a range of enforcement powers at our disposal where required.""
Age UK agrees that there's been progress, but says malnutrition in the NHS is still a big issue.
Lesley Carter, who works of the charity and is programme manager of the Malnutrition Task Force, says a third of people going into hospitals and care homes are already malnourished or at risk of malnutrition when they are admitted.
""That means they are already vulnerable to start with.""
She said that on busy wards, mealtimes might get rushed or overlooked without the right staffing.
""Older people in particular might need help to eat and drink, and they aren't always getting this. Food can still be left out of reach.
""Some hospitals have employed nutrition nurses to spot those patients that need help, and nutrition assistants to help with the feeding, which is good.
""But it is time consuming to feed someone properly.""
She says friends and families have a responsibility to keep a check on elderly loved ones too.
""We all need to realise that it's not natural to lose weight as we age.""

722,724,"Judge Carlos Castro Martins reversed the order he had issued in September, which had barred any work on the Belo Monte dam that interfered with the natural flow of the Xingu river.
He said the company behind the project had subsequently shown its work would not harm local fishing.
The project has been heavily criticised by environmentalists.
Judge Martins had originally ruled in favour of a fisheries group which argued that the dam would affect local fish stocks and could harm indigenous families who make a living from fishing.
He had barred the Norte Energia company behind the project from all work which could interfere with the natural flow of the Xingu river, including building a port, using explosives, installing dikes and building canals.
Legal wrangling
Norte Energia appealed against the decision and Judge Martins ruled on Friday that construction work on the dam could go ahead as the company had shown that local fishing boats would not be blocked or hindered in their work.
""Since the course of the water won't be altered, and there won't be much variation in the speed of its flow, (the project) won't have a major influence on the habitat of ornamental fish species used for fishing,"" he said.
Judge Martins did, however, say that the wider environmental impact of the project ""could only be felt and analysed once the work was completed, as the studies into its effects were only forecasts of what could happen"".
He also said that any work would have to comply with the regulations laid down by Brazil's Indian Affairs Department (Funai) and the National Environment Agency, Ibama.
Norte Energia said the temporary halt on the building work had not affected the project, as it had not yet reached the stage where the company needed to do any of the specific type of work which had fallen under the ban.
If it goes ahead, the 11,000-megawatt dam will be the third biggest in the world - after the Three Gorges in China and Itaipu, which is jointly run by Brazil and Paraguay.

The ban is the latest in a line of stories from around England of educational establishments outlawing everyday activities, many of which are remembered fondly from people's own school days. BBC News looks back at other forbidden school pursuits that have made headlines:
We start off with a perhaps unsurprising measure many schools enforce.
British Bulldog involves charging towards fellow pupils, a drop of the shoulder to fool the 'bulldogs' and a rapid dash to the safety of the other side of the yard.
These figures are a little old (like the above image), but over a quarter of 653 school staff surveyed by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers in 2011 said it had been banned from their school.
One secondary school teacher said it was ""because of the number of broken bones it generates!""
Schools in Wiltshire, Cumbria and Clackmannanshire introduced a ban on conkers over fears the horse chestnuts could trigger anaphylactic reactions.
The Anaphylaxis Campaign said a ""common sense approach"" would be better, where conkers are put in a safe place after battle and all involved give their hands a good wash.
Some schools took to allowing their children to take part in conker fights provided they were wearing protective goggles.
A Carlisle headteacher said it was a ""sensible"" step to shield children's eyes from pieces of flying horse chestnut.
In January, birthday cakes were banned at a Blackpool primary school as teachers ""do not have time"" to check ingredients for pupils with allergies.
Parents of children at Norbreck Primary Academy were told cakes taken into school would be ""sent home uneaten"".
The headteacher wrote: ""I hate to be a killjoy... there are many reasons for this, some of them serious.""
Pupils in Birmingham had to leave school after teachers said they were wearing the wrong kind of shoes.
Baverstock Academy, in Druids Heath, sent out letters informing families of new rules making plain black shoes compulsory.
One parent reported the ""ridiculous"" decision led to ""chaotic"" scenes, with about 300 children being sent home.
The school later relaxed the rule slightly, according to parents.
It wasn't the pupils but their parents who were making a scene at a primary school in Darlington.
Grown-ups on the school run were asked by the headteacher of Skerne Park Academy to wash in the morning and to not drop their kids off while wearing pyjamas.

724,726,"The exhibition, From Dark to Light, explores the work of artist Victor Noble Rainbird, who was born in North Shields in 1887.
The largest collection to have been staged since the 1930s, his favourite subjects were the North Sea and the streets and people of his hometown.
Curator Dave Young said there was a lot of affection for him in the town.
Many of the pieces on display at The Old Low Light Heritage Centre in North Shields have never been seen in public before.
Mr Young, said: ""We hope that this exhibition will shed new light on the life and work of a remarkable man and also a much misunderstood artist.
""This is the first major exhibition of his paintings to be held in his hometown of North Shields since the artist's lifetime and it is being held in a building that he would have known well and often painted.
""Victor Noble Rainbird's paintings are a fascinating legacy of life in the North East before and after the Great War, while his own remarkable war record is only now being unravelled.""
Mr Rainbird joined the Northumberland Fusiliers in 1914 when he was 26-years-old and served on the Western Front at Ypres, Passchendaele, Vimy Ridge and Armentieres.
Some of the drawings he produced while on active service have survived and are included in the exhibition.
Mr Young said they were a ""poignant, important and sombre record of the horrors of war"".
After the war, Rainbird made several return trips to France, Belgium and the Netherlands, producing some of his most impressive works.

726,728,"The EAW is widely seen to have speeded up extradition proceedings in the EU, but there is also pressure to fix shortcomings in the system.
What is the EAW?
The EAW operates EU-wide and replaced separate extradition arrangements between the EU member states. The EAW was introduced in January 2004, and was prompted by the international anti-terror drive after the 11 September 2001 attacks on the US.
A national judicial authority, such as a court, can issue an EAW to get a suspect extradited. For an EAW to be valid, the suspect must be accused of an offence incurring a maximum penalty of at least a year in prison, or must have been already sentenced to at least four months in prison.
The EAW means faster and simpler surrender procedures for suspects. EU states can no longer refuse to extradite one of their citizens on grounds of nationality. Extradition no longer requires a political decision for a suspect to be handed over. The EAW means mutual recognition of criminal justice systems in the EU.
How much faster are extradition proceedings now?
Before the EAW was introduced extradition used to take an average of one year, but now that has been cut to an average of 48 days, the European Commission says. A suspect must be handed over within a maximum of 90 days after arrest. In cases where a suspect agrees to surrender the average extradition time is 16 days.
How many EAWs are issued and how many suspects handed over?
Figures for 2009 show that 15,827 EAWs were issued in total and of those 4,431 were executed. The breakdown, given in a European Commission report, shows that Poland issued the most EAWs - 4,844. Of those, fewer than half were executed - 1,367. Germany was second for the number of EAWs issued - 2,433, then Romania with 1,900. The figures for the UK were: 220 issued, 80 executed.
What are the arguments for EAWs?
A senior British police officer, Commander Allan Gibson, says the EAW has brought a big increase in extradition and has reduced delays and costs. Cmdr Gibson, of the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), says the EAW has been a great help in cross-border operations against organised crime, such as joint UK-Czech and UK-Romanian action against people traffickers. In the UK, regional police forces can now issue EAWs, whereas previously extradition cases were all handled in London.
There have been some high-profile successes for the EAW. Fugitive teacher Jeremy Forrest, who fled to France with a schoolgirl, was extradited to England on an EAW issued in September 2012.  In 2005 an EAW enabled the UK to quickly extradite from Italy a fugitive bomber, Hussain Osman, who with accomplices had attempted to carry out a terror attack in London.  In 2012 a murderer, Jason McKay, was arrested in Warsaw and sent back to the UK within a month.
What are the criticisms of EAWs?
There has been much debate about proportionality - that is, the need to use EAWs only for the most serious crimes. In a debate on EU justice and policing Cmdr Gibson and Jodie Blackstock of the human rights group Justice said Poland had sent too many EAW requests to the UK.
A report by the campaign group Fair Trials International in May 2011 said EAWs ""are being issued for minor offences and without proper consideration of whether extradition is proportionate"". That concern was echoed by the European Commission, which said the use of EAWs for minor offences had undermined confidence in the system.
Fair Trials International also complained that suspects were ""not being provided with legal representation in the issuing state as well as the executing state"". According to Ms Blackstock, more needs to be done to ensure effective legal defence for suspects in cross-border cases. Often the defence lawyers are young and inexperienced in such cases, she says.
Baroness Sarah Ludford, a Lib Dem MEP specialising in EU justice issues, says EU justice officials should exercise more peer pressure on each other to prevent abuses of the EAW. If somebody has been cleared of charges they should be removed from the EAW alert system, she argues.
In one high-profile miscarriage of justice Deborah Dark, a British woman, was pursued across Europe because of an EAW issued by France, although she had been cleared of drug charges years previously.
Can a country refuse to execute an EAW?
Yes. There is the double jeopardy principle - a suspect will not be returned to the country that issued the EAW if he or she has already been tried for the same offence abroad. A refusal can be justified if an EU state's amnesty covers the offence in question. A refusal can also be justified under a statute of limitations - that is, if a time limit has passed for prosecution. And a state can reject an EAW if under its laws the suspect is a minor, below the age of criminal responsibility.
An EAW can also be rejected if legal authorities consider that extradition would violate the suspect's rights under the European Convention on Human Rights.
Concern that an EAW was motivated by prejudice on grounds of race, religion, politics or another factor can also be grounds to block extradition, under European law. The EAW is not supposed to be a tool for collusion in discrimination.","The UK government wants to claw back some EU powers over justice and policing, but is likely to remain in the European Arrest Warrant (EAW) system.",23239493,"The European Arrest Warrant (EAW) has streamlined extradition processes in the EU, reducing average extradition times from one year to 48 days, but there are concerns about proportionality, lack of legal representation for suspects, and the risk of miscarriages of justice, with some countries issuing EAWs for minor offenses and others refusing extradition based on human rights concerns.",0,"Article: {}

729,731,"He spoke after a crisis meeting in Brussels about the global steel glut that was attended by 30 countries.
China has ""absolutely recognised that it is a problem of overcapacity in their country"", Mr Javid said.
However, China rejected suggestions that it subsidised its loss-making steel companies, and the meeting ended without any formal agreement.
Nevertheless, Mr Javid said China is ""committing to do something about it and I think that's a very positive step forward"".
He said it was the first time all the major steel-producing nations had come together with the industry to discuss the issue of excess capacity.
Mr Javid admitted that there was no ""overnight solution"" to the issue of excess production: ""The discussion today with all these countries coming together is something that we pushed for, and ... China's participation will help make the difference.""
Chinese steel output rose in March, according to official figures released last week, despite repeated pledges to cut capacity.
Ministers and trade officials, including from the US and India, as well as the World Trade Organisation, World Steel Association and the private sector attended Monday's meeting, which was organised by the OECD.
Mari Kiviniemi, OECD deputy secretary-general, said there was ""very strong willingness"" to hold further talks, with some countries wanting to take more ""concrete steps"".
Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, said: ""We appear to be no closer to finding international action to put in place solutions. This is a global problem which requires a global solution to remove current over-capacity and time is a luxury we don't have.""
He called on China to take the same radical action that European steel producers had embraced.
Earlier, China's official news agency said that blaming the country for the global steel industry's problems was a ""lame and lazy excuse for protectionism"".
Xinhua said in an English-language commentary piece: ""Blaming other countries is always an easy, sure-fire way for politicians to whip up a storm over domestic economic woes, but finger-pointing and protectionism are counter-productive. The last thing the world needs is a trade war over this issue. Far more jobs will be lost than gained if protectionism prevails.""
EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstroem told the meeting the steel crisis was ""now life or death for many companies"", but that tariffs were ""only a short-term bandage"", adding: ""Healing the sector's wounds requires sustained international cooperation leading to effective reform.""
The internal market and industry commissioner, Elzbieta Bienkowska, said the European Union should consider allowing member nations to subsidise their steel industries.
""We have to discuss whether we can't be more flexible in our judgment of state aid,"" she told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. ""We cannot push this industry any further.""

The steel crisis has put thousands of UK jobs under threat at plants including Port Talbot in south Wales.
Tata Steel said last month that it was selling its unprofitable UK plants. The company has blamed factors including high energy costs and China ""dumping"" steel on the global market.
Britain's steel industry: What's going wrong?
Roy Rickhuss, leader of the Community union, said the meeting was more concerned with the long term, rather than immediate action to save the UK industry.
""Today's meeting seemed to be all about long-term challenges. While these issues do need addressing, what we need is urgent short-term action from governments across Europe and beyond to get us through the current crisis and create a sustainable future for steel.""
The Government has come under pressure to rescue Port Talbot and has been urged to consider part-nationalising the industry.
Mr Javid said parties interested in Tata's UK assets had started to come forward: ""It's too early to say much about them at this stage but the important thing is, as we said all along, we will do everything we can to help with that sales process. The steel workers of Britain deserve nothing less.""
The business secretary said that EY had been appointed to act as financial advisers on behalf of the Government, which was ""committed to doing all it can to ensure a sustainable future for the UK steel industry"".
Tata has also appointed Standard Chartered bank as an additional adviser.

It was an unusually abject performance from the Glasgow Jags, who were booed several times by their own fans and now sit six points ahead of the relegation zone with three games left.

The match doubled as a bit of window shopping for Caley Thistle boss John Hughes, who has eyes for a few out-of-contract Partick players.
One of them is Steven Lawless, who should have done better with a left-foot shot that he dragged wide following some combative work by Ryan Edwards.
Partick's pre-match guide pointed out that the hosts had not scored a first-half goal at Firhill since 16 January, and it would be the visitors who hit the back of the net in the opening 45 minutes this time round in Maryhill.
Inverness broke on the counter attack with just under a quarter-of-an-hour gone and a fine pass by Andrea Mbuyi-Mutombo released Tremarco.
At first it seemed the Englishman was not sure what to do as he surged down the left, but he took the correct decision to plough on ahead and send a lovely finish into the far corner with the inside of his left boot.
Sean Welsh watched his free-kick well saved by the diving Owain Fon Williams in the Inverness goalmouth soon after.
Matters did not improve for the hosts after the break. Caley Thistle immediately extended their lead when Meekings found Storey at the right edge of the box. Hands were raised looking for an offside flag but the on-loan Swindon Town man focused on the task of hitting a shot goal-ward and in it went off the far post from a tight angle.
The Firhill crowd got even more uneasy when Roberts' close-range effort hit the post following good set-up play by Mbuyi-Mutombo, then Partick goalkeeper Ryan Scully had to pull off a great stop to deny Storey getting his second of the afternoon.
When Roberts' low drive narrowly missed the target moments later, the home support unleashed a barrage of boos.
Meekings did not miss, however. His controlled side-foot finish from Greg Tansey's corner made it three and very, very easy for Inverness.
Doolan did eventually manage to reduce the deficit, rounding Fon Williams after his initial effort was saved, but it did not take long for the visitors to restore their three-goal lead.

732,734,"Delivering his judgement, a judge said it was for the Stormont Assembly, and not a judge, to decide social policy.
A joint case was taken by the first lesbian couple and the first gay couple to enter civil partnerships in the UK.
The second case was brought by a couple who wed in England but want their marriage legally recognised at home in Northern Ireland.
The judge heard the cases together due to the similarities of the legal arguments.
Mr Justice O'Hara said: ""It is not at all difficult to understand how gay men and lesbians who have suffered discrimination, rejection and exclusion feel so strongly about the maintenance in Northern Ireland of the barrier to same sex marriage.
""However, the judgment which I have to reach is not based on social policy but on the law.""
Same-sex marriage is legal in England, Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland, but is banned in Northern Ireland.
Shannon Sickles, Grainne Close, and Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane were challenging Stormont's refusal to legislate for same-sex marriage.
Ms Close said she was ""devastated"" by the ruling.
""For us, this is a personal matter,"" she said.
""We have families and our children are being treated differently because of today's result.""
Her partner, Ms Sickles, said they would continue their legal challenge.
Twelve years ago, Northern Ireland was the first place in the UK to introduce civil partnerships.
Ms Sickles and Ms Close made history on 19 December 2005 when their relationship was legally recognised in the UK's first civil partnership ceremony at Belfast City Hall.
They were closely followed by Chris and Henry Flanagan-Kane, whose civil partnership took place later that same day.
During the joint challenge to the law in Northern Ireland, the couple's lawyers argued that the ban breaches Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, by denying respect for their private and family lives.
But a lawyer for Stormont's Department of Finance and Personnel (DFP) countered that the ban was not a breach of human rights and that civil partnerships already met the minimum requirements set out under human rights law.
The couple who married in England had been granted anonymity, and their case was referred to as Petition X.
The campaign for same-sex marriage has been highly divisive at the Northern Ireland Assembly in recent years, and is currently one of the main sticking points in Stormont's continuing political crisis.
Assembly members (MLAs) have voted five times on whether or not to introduce same-sex marriage.
During the fifth vote in November 2015, MLAs voted in favour of legalisation for the first time, with the slimmest majority of 53 votes to 52.
However, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) used a Stormont veto, known as a petition of concern, to block the motion and prevent any change in the law.
Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw said it was ""shameful"" the couples had been forced to take their cases to court.
""Last May both Sinn Féin and the DUP refused the Alliance Party's proposal to reform the petition of concern - the crucial reform that would make equal marriage a reality,"" she said.
""Now the challenge has been thrown firmly back at the politicians and it is essential we get Stormont up and running again to stabilise Northern Ireland and start delivering for everyone.""
The marriage of the couple in the Petition X case was treated as a civil partnership in Northern Ireland, under the terms of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013,
The devolved distinction was made possible after negotiations between a previous Westminster government and a previous Northern Ireland Assembly.
The couple took their vows ""because they believe in the traditional values associated with marriage,"" according to their solicitor.
""We sighed when the ruling was read out not through disappointment, but simply because the inevitable recognition of same-sex marriage has been further delayed in Northern Ireland,"" they said.
""The work will continue, the wind is to our back.""

They brought the test case to the High Court, claiming the delay was unlawful.
A minister said ""significant progress"" had been made in processing claims.
PIPs started replacing disability allowance in April 2013.
Labour, along with several charities, criticised the government for the way it handled the switchover, which left about 3,000 people waiting more than a year to have their welfare claims processed.
The High Court is now conducting a judicial review into the payment system.
The claimants said they struggled to pay for food and fuel because of the delays and their health declined as a result.
They had a right to such benefits under the law and should have received them within a ""reasonable time"", their lawyers told the court.
One of the claimants, Ms C, from Kent, said she had to leave her job because of ill health. She suffers from ME and severe depression.
""I was completely isolated during the nine months I was waiting for my payments.
""While my wait came to an end, it is worrying that many, many others have still not received a decision.""
Justin Tomlinson, the minister for disabled people, said that PIP claims were being processed ""at five times the rate they were in January 2014"".
He added: ""In addition 21% of claimants have been awarded the highest rate, compared to 16% under the disability living allowance, demonstrating that the benefit is being targeted at those who need it most.""
But counsel for the claimants said the ""most challenging phase"" of the PIP rollout was still to come.
About 1.5 million recipients of disability allowance will be moved into the new scheme at the same time as existing PIP claimants face reassessment.

It is backed by the Welsh government and other organisations.
It comes as the water company's half year financial report showed a strong overall performance for the six months leading up to September.
The non-shareholder company - which says all its gains go to customers - said it invested £174m in large projects and essential infrastructure in that period - nearly £1m a day.
It also confirmed that a further £170m will be invested between October 2014 and April 2015.
Chief Executive Chris Jones said: ""With all our gains going to customers, we can deliver real value by accelerating investment, keeping bills low and helping those who genuinely struggle to pay their water bills.""
The HelpU tariff has been developed with support from the independent consumer watchdog Consumer Council for Water (CCWater), the Welsh government and housing associations group Community Housing Cymru.
It will be targeted at customers spending more than 5% of their income on water bills.

The new deal does not extend Conte's commitment to the club, as he signed a three-year contract on his arrival in west London in the summer of 2016.
""I am very happy to have signed a new contract,"" said the Italian, 47.
""We worked extremely hard in our first year to achieve something amazing, which I am very proud of. Now we must work even harder to stay at the top.""
The decision to sign a new contract without extending the terms runs counter to previous comments by Conte, who had indicated his willingness to commit to a longer deal.
Speaking in May, he said he wanted to stay with Chelsea ""for many years"", adding: ""If the club give me the possibility to stay and extend my contract, for sure I'm available to.""
Conte lifted the Premier League title at the first attempt in the 2016-17 season, winning 30 games, which included a club record 13 consecutive victories. He also guided the Blues to the FA Cup final, though they were beaten by Arsenal.
The former Juventus and Italy manager was credited for transforming the Stamford Bridge club's fortunes after they could only finish 10th the previous season.
A brutal training regime was part of the transformation, as was his decision to switch to a three-man central-defensive set-up - his preferred tactic at both Juve and Italy.
""The Chelsea fans have given me so much support since I arrived here one year ago and it is important we continue to succeed together,"" added Conte, whose team has flown out to China and Singapore for pre-season games against the Gunners, Bayern Munich and Inter Milan.
Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia added: ""Antonio achieved incredible success last season, adapting to English football very quickly and leading us to the Premier League title.

Blues have signed midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko from French champions Monaco in a reported £40m deal, and also brought in defender Antonio Rudiger from Roma for an initial £29m.

736,738,"Business Secretary Sajid Javid told the Green Investment Bank's annual meeting he would start ""exploring options"" to bring in private investors.
The bank, thought to be the first of its kind, has invested about £2bn of public money in about 50 projects.
But critics called the sale ""reckless"" and questioned the government's commitment to a low-carbon economy.
It is unclear how much of the GIB the government might sell, although the Financial Times has reported that it could be about 70%, with a sale price of well above £1bn.
The move is part of the government's plan to sell off assets to pay down the deficit, and comes after the disposal of stakes in Royal Mail and Lloyds Banking Group.
The Edinburgh-based GIB was launched in 2012, pledging loans to ""green"" projects that have also attracted private sector money. It has invested in wind power, bio-energy, and renewal projects.
The bank said it became profitable in the 2014-15 financial year, making a £100,000 pre-tax profit.
But there are restrictions on its borrowing, and Mr Javid hopes that full access to the capital markets will increase its lending powers.
Speaking at the GIB's annual review event in London on Thursday, Mr Javid said: ""The bank will be able to access a much greater volume of capital and deploy it across a much wider array of green projects.""
He added that the privatisation would mean ""more money going into green innovations"" and more support for ""environmental entrepreneurs"".
Mr Javid said the GIB had debunked the idea that green investment was incapable of making a profit.
""Its rigorous, commercial approach to investment has helped attract sovereign wealth funds, pension schemes and private equity investors to the sector for the very first time,"" he said.
Chancellor George Osborne said in an earlier statement: ""We want the Green Investment Bank to attract more investment and we will use the money we raise to pay down the national debt and deliver lasting economic security for working people.""
Mr Javid's department has hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch to advise on the financial details and timetable for the sale.
Critics argue that a sale would dilute the bank's purpose and undermine the UK's commitment to the green economy.
Caroline Lucas, Green MP for Brighton Pavilion, called the sell-off plan ""rash and irresponsible"" and said any such move called into question the UK's commitment to investing in a low-carbon economy.
""The government should keep at least a majority stake in the Green Investment Bank to ensure investor confidence is upheld and the commitment to low-carbon lending remains,"" she said.
Think-tank E3G, which advised on the original plans to established a green bank, said a sell-off would be ""reckless"" and damage investor confidence.
Chief executive Nick Mabey said: ""The Green Investment Bank is not just the government's most lauded innovation in the war against climate change. It has kept investment in the real economy going at a time when bank lending had fallen to an all-time low.

738,740,"At a Buckingham Palace garden party in pouring rain on Tuesday, the Queen commented, ""Oh, bad luck""  when told a Metropolitan Police commander had led the police operation around the Chinese leader's visit.
The Queen's unguarded comments are atypical for her, but also pose some unanswered questions about the visit.
In short, we don't know. Police Commander Lucy D'Orsi was ""seriously, seriously undermined by the Chinese"", according to the Lord Chamberlain, who introduced her to the Queen.
Commander D'Orsi said it ""was quite a testing time"" and that ""they walked out of Lancaster House and told me that the trip was off"".
The Queen clearly knew all about the incident concerned and interjected: ""They were very rude to the ambassador.""
""They walked out on both of us,"" replied Ms D'Orsi.
Did Ms D'Orsi mean that Chinese officials threatened to cancel the whole state visit? Or just part of the itinerary?
Was any conflict to do with security arrangements (as Ms D'Orsi was clearly under pressure) or of wider diplomatic significance?
We simply do not know. The police have not issued any statement.
President Xi and his wife Madame Peng were guests of the Queen and Prince Philip at Buckingham Palace for the state visit so perhaps it is to be expected that the Queen would be aware of such details.
The Metropolitan Police had to defend itself from human rights groups' accusations that it dealt inappropriately with protesters during Mr Xi's visit in October 2015.
Commander D'Orsi issued a statement in the immediate aftermath of the visit saying she was disappointed at hearing the view expressed that the Met was ""working to the bidding of the Chinese to suppress protest"".
The Queen's comments were picked up by the microphone of the camera filming the garden party event, operated by Peter Wilkinson, the monarch's official cameraman
His footage was released to broadcasters under the ""pool"" arrangement which is standard procedure for royal events (to avoid all broadcasters sending their own crews to every engagement).
It was only then that the uncharacteristically undiplomatic comments were spotted.
Indeed. At the time Mr Xi said he believed his visit would lift UK-China relations to a ""new height"".
Buckingham Palace would not comment on a ""private conversation"" but said all parties worked closely to ensure the visit proceeded smoothly.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said the president's trip to the UK was very successful and ""marked the start of the Golden Era between China and the UK"".
We now know, thanks to the Queen's comments, that it was a testing time behind the scenes, at least for the police commander and the British ambassador to China. However, that does not mean that overall the trip was not a success.
Kerry Brown, Professor of Chinese Studies at King's College London, and a former senior British diplomat in Beijing, told the BBC that it was striking that even someone with the Queen's six decades of diplomatic experience still found dealing with the Chinese protocols and machinery tough:
""In terms of the atmospherics between diplomats in China and the UK, it's not an easy relationship and that comes through in the freight of emotion that was in her comments.""
At the moment, there is no coverage whatsoever of this in mainland China, says BBC Monitoring's China Media Analyst Kerry Allen.
""This is not unusual. The comments the Queen made will be regarded as highly embarrassing by China's elite, as the concept of 'maintaining face' - one's sense of dignity or prestige - is incredibly important within the country,"" she says.
""Owing to the sensitivity of her comments, state media will be required to hold off covering this until the government decides what official response to give.
""Some users of popular microblogs like Sina Weibo though are commenting on it and quickly gaining responses. However, the censors are catching up and censoring comments to limit impact.""

739,741,"They will be able to end tenancies, sometimes without a court order, when asylum requests fail, ministers say.
Landlords will also be required to check a migrant's status in advance of agreeing a lease. Repeat offenders could face up to five years in prison.
But critics have said it may lead to UK citizens being refused accommodation.
The proposals - to be included in the upcoming Immigration Bill - come as the British and French governments struggle to deal with a migrant crisis in Calais, where large numbers of people are making nightly bids to cross the Channel to reach the UK.
Under the proposals for landlords in England, the Home Office would issue a notice when an asylum application fails that confirms the tenant no longer has the right to rent property.
Analysis by legal correspondent Clive Coleman
It is currently a criminal offence to remove tenants without a court order. Obtaining that order enables bailiffs to evict tenants. That all takes time. The new measure may cut out court orders, but it is unclear:
This will trigger a power for landlords to end the tenancy, without a court order in some circumstances.
Landlords will also be required to carry out ""right to rent"" checks on each tenant's immigration status before allowing them to move in, expanding a pilot that has been running for a year in the west Midlands.
Repeatedly failing to do either would be a new offence carrying maximum penalties of five years' imprisonment or a fine.
A blacklist of ""rogue"" landlords and letting agents will allow councils to keep track of those who have been convicted of housing offences and ban them from renting out properties if they are repeat offenders.
Communities Secretary Greg Clark acknowledged that cases in which tenants refused to move out would still end up in court but that the process would be quicker because landlords would have official ""evidence"" to present to the courts of their tenant's status.
""You have saved the landlord having to spend money establishing something that is clear and that the Home Office can provide - which is a clear statement of whether they should be there or not,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Asked whether evicting migrants simply increased the risk of people disappearing altogether, unless immediately detained by the police, Mr Clark said the initiative was part of a ""joined-up system to send people home"".
Analysis, by Alicia McCarthy
The streets of the UK are not paved with gold. That's the clear message the government wants to send to those tempted to come to Britain illegally.
Ministers say the tightening of the demands on private landlords in England is simply the enactment of a manifesto promise to make them carry out the same checks as employers and that migrants need to know there is no right to work or rent a home if you are in the UK illegally.
It's not clear yet how the scheme will work or what impact it will have other than moving illegal immigrants from where they are living.
And some may suspect the timing of the announcement is a response to the nightly television news pictures showing scores of desperate migrants trying to cross the channel - and to criticism from some that ministers have failed to get a grip on the situation swiftly enough.
For Labour, shadow immigration minister David Hanson said he backed tougher checks but said ministers appeared to be ""offloading"" the problem on to landlords and it was up to the authorities to decide whether people should be allowed to remain or deported.
Since August 2014, private landlords in five councils - Dudley, Sandwell, Wolverhampton, Walsall and Birmingham - have been required to conduct checks to establish new tenants have the right to rent in the UK or face face a penalty of up to £3,000.
Mr Clark said the pilot - introduced as part of the 2014 Immigration Act - had been a success and would be extended across more of the UK, although he could not say how many people had been deported as a direct result.
But the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants said the pilot - which has yet to be officially evaluated - had serious shortcomings.
""We have heard that British people with foreign accents are finding it difficult to get tenancies from some of the, you might say, unscrupulous landlords,"" its chief executive Habib Rahman told Radio 4's World at One.
And David Smith, from the Residential Landlords Association, said there was evidence of ""document discrimination"" with some landlords reluctant to rent their properties to anyone who could not produce a valid passport.",Landlords in England will be expected to evict tenants who lose the right to live in the UK  under new measures to clamp down on illegal immigration.,33754595,"The UK government has announced plans to require landlords to check the immigration status of potential tenants and to end tenancies when asylum requests fail, in an effort to crack down on illegal immigration and reduce the number of migrants living in the UK without proper documentation.",0,"Article: {}

Speaking to the Independent on Sunday, Mr Corbyn said Labour ""shouldn't shy away"" from public control of railways and public investment in industry.
Leadership rival Liz Kendall told the paper Clause IV belonged in the past.
Tony Blair's move two decades ago to ditch the long-standing commitment in Labour's constitution to public ownership was seen by some as a symbolic step which made the party more electable in the post-Margaret Thatcher era.
The original wording of Clause IV was replaced with a new commitment to ""a thriving private sector and high-quality public services where those undertakings essential to the common good are either owned by the public or accountable to them"".
Mr Corbyn told the IoS he could consider bringing back the old Clause IV as part of a commitment to take ""necessary things"" back into public ownership.
""I think we should talk about what the objectives of the party are, whether that's restoring the Clause IV as it was originally written or it's a different one, but I think we shouldn't shy away from public participation, public investment in industry and public control of the railways,"" he said.
""I'm interested in the idea that we have a more inclusive, clearer set of objectives. I would want us to have a set of objectives which does include public ownership of some necessary things such as rail.""
Mr Corbyn's campaign momentum seems unflagging  - to the alarm of senior figures in the party. But he says the party needs a new statement of objectives - and that could be the original Clause IV.
Jeremy Corbyn has already promised to renationalise energy companies and the railways and increase public spending on industry. One of Mr Corbyn's leadership rivals, Liz Kendall, condemned the idea as a ""throwback to the past"".
Some party donors are alarmed by the prospect of a Jeremy Corbyn win too. Businessman Assem Allam, who donated Â£300,000 to Labour during the election, has told the Sunday Telegraph he would stop giving money to the party if Mr Corbyn becomes leader, saying he never backed a ""dead horse"".
Mr Corbyn is one of four candidates standing in next month's Labour leader election, alongside Liz Kendall, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham.
Ms Kendall - the leadership challenger seen as being the closest to Mr Blair's policies - fiercely condemned the idea of bringing back Clause IV.
""This shows there is nothing new about Jeremy Corbyn's politics,"" she said.

As well as storing carbon, the forests provide habitat for fish and protect communities from tsunamis and cyclones.
Also on Tuesday - World Mangrove Day - Sri Lanka's president will open the world's first mangrove museum.
The museum will act as a hub for conservation training for adults, and educating children about the value of mangroves. It is estimated that 20,000 pupils will visit the museum in the first year.
Read also: The community who won back their mangroves
The Sri Lankan government has also included mangrove forest conservation into its national curriculum.
The museum is a central pillar of a five-year programme to protect all of the island nation's mangroves.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said: ""Mangroves swiftly absorb carbon dioxide and inject oxygen into the atmosphere, maintaining an ecological balance vital for the environment.
""It is my belief that the mangrove restoration project will generate much needed awareness among key stakeholders such as the community, leisure sector personnel, tourists, and the general public.""
He added: ""It is my hope that this will be the beginning of a long-term effort to sustain the mangroves for greater conservation benefit.""
In partnership with island conservation organisation Seacology and local NGO Sudeesa, the Sri Lankan government has identified all of the nation's 15,000 hectares of mangrove forests, and has surveyed almost half of them.
Ministers have also introduced legislation to protect the habitats and have assigned forest officers to help guard them.
Seacology executive director Duane Silverstein explained that although the project required US $3.4 million of funding, the sum was dwarfed when the ecosystem services provided by Sri Lanka's mangrove forests were taken into account.
""In last year, research has been published looking at the economic value of mangrove in Asia,"" he said.
""It has concluded that each hectare has a value of US $194,000 - that would put an economic value of our project at US $2.9 billion.""
He told BBC News that mangroves were critical in a number of areas, socially as well as environmentally.
""Firstly, they provide nurseries for young fish, which are protected among the mangrove roots,"" he explained.
""Secondly, and increasingly important, they provide protection from natural disasters such as tsunamis and cyclones. They disperse the energy in the sea and waves, therefore the villages that have intact mangroves suffer significantly less damage.
""Thirdly, and most importantly, mangrove forests sequester far much more carbon than other times of forest. A recent UN report estimated that mangroves store about 1,000 tonnes per hectare in their biomass and underlying soil. There is a minimum of 15,000 hectares of mangrove in Sri Lanka, meaning that the country's mangroves are sequestering 15 million tonnes of carbon.""
One of the threats facing mangrove forests around the world is the emergence of shrimp farms in order to meet the growing global demand for shrimps/prawns.
In order to build saltwater ponds needed to rear the crustaceans, mangroves - which grown in the intertidal area of shorelines - are felled, either legally or illegally.
This practice has been identified by the United Nations as one of the main drivers for the loss of the valuable and most at-risk habitat, with more than half of mangroves being lost or felled over the past century.
However, the development of shrimp farms in Sri Lanka had resulted in a significant fall in fish catch yields, say local conservationists.
This resulted in local fishing communities losing incomes and livelihoods, making them aware of the importance and value of healthy mangrove forests, and keen to protect them.
Mr Silverstein said that the conservation model adopted in Sri Lanka could be rolled out to other mangrove-rich nations, however he added that ""one size would not fit all"".
""However, it is very clear that we are demonstrating that a nation can preserve all of its mangroves, and still improve the economic quality of people's lives.
""Although the Sri Lanka project has four more years to run, it does take many years of planning. We are looking at working with another nation to do something similar.""

744,746,"During a visit to Birmingham on Tuesday, Jeremy Corbyn is expected to say a 17% increase in Carer's Allowance would help around one million people in the first year of a Labour government.
Under the plan, Carer's Allowance would rise from £62.70 to £73.10 a week.
Ministers say they will spend an extra £2bn on social care over three years.
Carer's Allowance is paid to around 6.5m people in the UK who care for older, disabled and seriously ill friends or relatives for at least 35 hours a week.
Eligible carers cannot earn more than £116 a week after tax.
Mr Corbyn said he believed it ""would be a good thing to do"" to help carers, ""usually women"" who have to give up their jobs to look after elderly relatives at home.
""Caring for people is stressful,"" he told the BBC. ""In some way it's enjoyable because you want to do it, but you shouldn't be impoverished because of it. It's also lonely.""
In his speech later, the Labour leader will claim ""Britain's social care crisis was made in Downing Street by cutting £4.6bn from council care budgets"".
""Millions of unpaid carers have been forced to fill the gap and put under even greater pressure as a result,"" he will say.
""The care they give to the disabled, sick and elderly saves taxpayers £132bn a year. So we believe these unsung, unpaid heroes not only deserve our praise and recognition - they deserve better financial support.
""That's why Labour is convinced it's both morally and economically right to give the Carer's Allowance a boost of £10 a week.
""We also think it's only fair that this extra support for carers is funded by scrapping the Tory cut on inheritance tax, which will only benefit the wealthiest people in Britain.
""This will be the first step in helping to transform our social care system for the 21st century and boosting support for family carers.""
According to Labour, up-rating Carer's Allowance would cost £538m by 2020/21. This would be covered by scrapping the expected £650m cut to inheritance tax, which allows married couples to pass on estates worth £1m free of death duties.
But the Conservatives claim Labour would be unable to fund the promise to increase the allowance.
Luke Hall, a Tory member of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said: ""Carers make a huge contribution to society, so it's only right that we do everything we can to support the selfless work they do.
""That's why we already increased the rate of Carer's Allowance, meaning an additional £450 a year for carers since 2010.
""Labour have already committed the money from corporation tax cuts 11 times over, so there is no way they could find the additional money for this promise.
""It's not worth the paper it's written on - just like Labour's reputation for economic management.""
The government has recently committed to spending an extra £2bn on the social care system over the next three years and allowed local authorities to raise council tax bills in order to fund social care services.","Labour has promised to boost the benefits of the ""unsung heroes"" who care for the vulnerable by £10 a week if the party wins the next election.",39627689,"Sure!

745,747,"The experimental aircraft, which has a wingspan bigger than a jumbo but weighs little more than a large car, left Nanjing at 02:39 (18:39 GMT).
It is likely to take Mr Borschberg five to six days of continuous flight to reach his central Pacific destination.
He will try to stay awake for much of that time, taking only short catnaps.
His progress will be monitored the entire way from a control room in Monaco.
Meteorologists and flight strategists will constantly update him on the best route to follow.
The journey is the seventh leg in the single-seat, propeller-driven aircraft's quest to circumnavigate the globe using just the energy of the Sun.
The project made steady progress after starting out from Abu Dhabi in March, but was held up for more than a month on China's east coast waiting for the right weather conditions over the ocean.
Solar Impulse needs not only favourable winds to help push it forward, but also clear skies to enable its 17,000 wing-mounted photovoltaic cells to achieve peak performance.
These cells must have the vehicle's lithium-ion batteries fully topped up at dusk to sustain flying through to dawn the next day.
Mr Borschberg is a highly experienced pilot, and as a trained engineer is completely familiar with the plane's systems.
Nonetheless, he is in no doubt how tough the mission will be.
""It's more in the end about myself; it's going to be an inner-voyage,"" he told the BBC before departure.
""It's going to be a discovery about how I feel and how I sustain myself during these five or six days in the air.""
And Bertrand Piccard - who has flown Solar Impulse on other stages of the voyage - told the BBC: ""There's one pilot at a time, so the pilot needs to do everything on his own. And it's a very large aeroplane, big wingspans, sensitive to turbulence, flying quite slow.
""So sometimes it's difficult to handle when the air moves. But we have an auto-pilot, we have toilets on board, we have food for days, water reserves and everything, and we are well trained.""
The distance to Kalaeloa airport on Hawaii's O'ahu island is more than 8,000km (5,000 miles).
If, early on in the flight, the weather turns bad or he encounters a major technical problem, Mr Borschberg can always choose to turn around and head back to China or Japan.
But there will come a point where that option is denied to him, and Mr Borschberg and his support team have had to prepare for the possibility of ditching in the Pacific if something goes seriously wrong.
The pilot himself would not go down with the plane because of the risk of electrocution once in the water. Instead, he would bail out with a dinghy and wait for a ship to come and pick him up.
If he succeeds in reaching Kalaeloa airport, he will set several aviation records - not least the longest-duration journey for a single-seater plane.
The purpose of the Solar Impulse project is not really to showcase a particular kind of future for aviation, but rather to demonstrate the potential of clean technologies more generally.

During the works, about 50,000 tonnes of material will be laid on the 2.9km (1.8 mile) runway.
Traditionally, airports close for up to 14 days to carry out such work.
Airport bosses said completing the refurbishment over several weekends rather than all at once was the ""best way to avoid major disruption"".
The closures were agreed following two years of discussions with retailers and airlines, airport management added.
""Some of our retail partners are refurbishing their shops which they wouldn't be able to do when the airport is open,"" said Jack Kelly from EMA.
""We've made sure flights can come in ahead of the closure and more flights can go out after it, so we are limiting the amount of disruption.""
The runway was last refurbished in 1999 and has a lifespan between 12 to 17 years.
